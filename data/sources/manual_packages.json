        "title": "Miami",
        "extract": "Miami is a major city in the southeastern United States and the second most populous city in Florida. The Greater Miami  metropolitan area is the largest in the state with an estimated population just under 6.1 million (2021), which makes it the 9th most populous metro area in the United States.\nAlthough tourists generally consider Miami Beach to be part of Miami, it is its own municipality. Miami Beach sits on a barrier island east of Miami and Biscayne Bay. It is home to lots of beach resorts, and is one of the most popular spring break party destinations in the world. This article only covers the city of Miami, not Miami Beach. Some other sights associated with Miami, like the Miami Zoo and the Miami Dolphins football team, are in other suburbs within Miami-Dade County, and two other institutions associated with Miami, the Florida Panthers hockey team and Inter Miami CF soccer team, play home games in Broward County.\n\n\n== Districts ==\n\n\n== Understand ==\n\n\n=== History ===\nFlagler\u2019s railroad sparked a wave of expansion in areas such as Miami Beach, Homestead and Cutler. Soon after the railroad was built, the Overseas Highway was created. This highway connected the Florida Keys to the mainland. Growth and progress in Miami continued through World War I and into the mid-1920s.\nA devastating hurricane in 1926 halted Miami\u2019s growth and temporarily put the city and Miami Beach in a recession. It was the city\u2019s support of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal that helped the city rebuild. Roosevelt almost lost his life, however, when Giuseppe Zangara attempted to assassinate Roosevelt when he came to Miami to thank the city for its support of the New Deal.\nWhen a German U-boat sank a US tanker off Florida\u2019s coast, the majority of South Florida was converted into military headquarters for the remainder of World War II. The Army\u2019s World War II legacy in Miami is a school designed for anti-U-boat warfare.\nFollowing the Cuban revolution, Miami has become a haven for Cuban immigrants. The city has also been the base for cocaine smuggling, as depicted in the 1983 film Scarface, the Miami Vice TV series and the 2002 video game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nBecause of its proximity to the Tropic of Cancer, Miami is generally hot. The summer months of June\u2013September will see most daytime highs over 90\u00b0F (32\u00b0C). Combined with the region's humidity, these can make for stifling temperatures, both day and night. Heat indicies in the summer months tend to average around 98 \u00b0F (37 \u00b0C) during the daytime hours and 82 \u00b0F (28 \u00b0C) at night. On some particularly sweltering days, the heat index can climb upwards to 106 \u00b0F (41 \u00b0C) and not go below 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C) at night. You won't see nearly a car or home without running air conditioning. Winters average an impressive 75\u00b0F (24\u00b0C) for daytime temperatures and nights are slightly cooler. During June to November, rain and thunderstorms can be expected and are most common in the afternoon hours. Rain is known to fall heavily for a few minutes, to stop entirely, and then to begin again. Knowing its mercurial nature, local residents often drive or go outside in rainy weather to enjoy its cooling effect or to make good use of breaks in the storm.\n\n\n=== Tourist information ===\n Greater Miami and the Beaches Convention & Visitors Bureau, 27th floor of 701 Brickell Ave, \u260f +1 305 539-3000. M-F 8:30AM-5PM. (updated Apr 2020)\n\n\n== Talk ==\n\nMiami has the largest Latin American population outside of Latin America, with nearly 65% of its population either from Latin America or of Latin American ancestry. Spanish is a language often used for day-to-day discourse in many places, although English is the language of preference, especially when dealing with business and government. Many locals do not speak English, but this is usually centered among shops and restaurants in residential communities and rarely the case in large tourist areas or the downtown district. Even when encountering a local who does not speak English, you can easily find another local to help with translation if needed, since most of the population is fluently bilingual. In certain neighborhoods, such as Little Havana and Hialeah, most locals will address a person first in Spanish and then in English. \"Spanglish\", a mixture of English and Spanish, is a somewhat common occurrence (but less so than in the American Southwest), with bilingual locals switching between English and Spanish mid-sentence and occasionally replacing a common English word for its Spanish equivalent and vice versa.\nHaitian Creole is another language heard primarily in northern Miami. It is common for a person to hear a conversation in this French-based Creole when riding public transportation or sitting at a restaurant. Many signs and public announcements are in English, Spanish and Haitian Creole because of Miami's diverse immigrant population. Unlike Spanish, Haitian Creole is generally centered among the Haitian neighborhoods in northern Miami. Most Haitians are more adapted to English than their Hispanic neighbors. Portuguese and French are other languages that may be encountered in Miami. These languages tend to be spoken mainly around tourist areas. Most speakers of these languages speak English as well.\n\n\n== Get in ==\n\n\n=== By plane ===\n1 Miami International Airport (MIA IATA) (just west of the city in an unincorporated suburban area). The airport is an important hub for traffic between North America, the Caribbean and Latin America, and one of the largest airports in the world. As a result, Spanish is just as likely to be understood as English. The international traffic makes MIA a large and congested place. Be sure to allow extra time when departing MIA, particularly if flying internationally, as you may face an hour-long line just to check your bags. Curbside check-in is an excellent idea.   \nAt MIA, public transportation and car rental are at the new 2 Miami Intermodal Center, which is a short shuttle train ride away from the terminals, follow signs for \"MIAmover\". The MIC is to become Miami's Grand Central station with hub connections of Metrorail station (for connections to Metromover), Greyhound, Megabus, Tri-Rail, taxis, Metrobus, and all car-rental facilities.\nFor downtown Miami, take the Metrorail to Government Center station, where transfers are available to buses to most destinations. Many hotels are along the MetroMover which is one level down from the MetroRail Government Center station. Consult a map for the closest MetroMover station or bus route to your hotel. It costs $2.25 for the MetroRail to downtown Miami. You pay by purchasing an \"EASY Card\" or \"EASY Ticket\" fare card, which can be bought from the Metrorail station at MIA, or at Terminal E of MIA.\nIf your destination is far from a MetroRail station, you may want to take a taxi or rent a car from the MIC instead.\nFor Miami Beach, you may want to take the 150 express bus from the MIC.\nFort Lauderdale International Airport (FLL IATA) is 25\u201340 minutes north of Miami proper, depending on traffic. It serves many fewer international routes than MIA, but it is smaller and less trafficked, making customs, immigration and security a bit easier to go through. Allegiant, Southwest Airlines, JetBlue, Spirit Airlines and other low-cost carriers generally use FLL instead of MIA, making FLL a cheaper alternative in many cases.\nIf you are arriving at FLL, there is a free \"FLL-Tri-Rail\" shuttle bus to the nearby Tri-Rail Ft Lauderdale Airport Station. Tri-Rail trains connect West Palm Beach, Boca Raton, Fort Lauderdale and Miami (the Miami Airport station, not downtown Miami). Another way to get to Miami is to take the #1 Broward County Bus to Aventura Mall and transfer to the S Miami-Dade bus to downtown Miami via South Beach. The 93 also goes to Miami from Aventura Mall. This option is inadvisable if traveling with a lot of luggage. At FLL, car rental facilities are more conveniently located in the parking garage adjacent to the terminals.\n\n\n==== Private aviation ====\n3 Miami-Opa Locka Executive Airport (OPF  IATA) (16 miles / 26 km north of downtown Miami). It's the preferred airport for general aviation and business jet travelers out of the Miami area, 10 minutes from Hard Rock Stadium (home of the Miami Dolphins), 35 minutes from Marlins Park (home of the Miami Marlins), 35 minutes from Downtown Miami, 30 minutes from Miami Beach, and 20 minutes from Miami International Airport. Air taxi and jet charter companies including as Jetset Charter and Miami Beach Jet Charter fly a variety of private charter aircraft and jets, from luxury Gulfstreams down to economical piston twins for small groups and individuals.   (updated Mar 2019)\nMiami Executive Airport (FAA LID: TMB), known until 2014 as Tamiami Executive, is another private jet hub southwest of Miami and just west of the Florida Turnpike near Kendall.\nOPF and TMB offer 24 hour operations, private terminals, and customs & immigration services.\n\n\n=== By train ===\nSee also: Rail travel in the United States\n\n Amtrak runs two daily services from New York City, the Silver Meteor and Silver Star, via Washington, D.C., Savannah, Orlando, Tampa and other cities along the eastern coast. The two trains take slightly different routes; the Silver Meteor calls in Charleston while the Silver Star takes an inland route, calling in Raleigh and Columbia. Between Winter Haven and Kissimmee, the Silver Star detours towards Tampa and Lakeland while Silver Meteor proceeds directly between Kissimmee and Winter Haven:\n\n4 Miami Amtrak station, 8303 NW 37th Ave. Located next to the Metro Rail Transfer Station, for connections to Tri-Rail and the local Metrorail. There's a waiting room and ticket office. Additional same station, cross platform, transfers in the area with Tri-Rail are in Hollywood,  Ft Lauderdale, Delray Beach, West Palm Beach.   (updated Dec 2019)\n  Brightline operates intercity passenger service from Orlando International Airport via West Palm Beach and Fort Lauderdale. The West Palm Beach to Miami section began operations in May 2018 while the Orlando to West Beach segment opened in September 2023. Plans are underway to continue west from Orlando International Airport to Tampa. There are over fifteen departures per day.\n\n5 Miami Central, 600 NW 1st Ave. Centrally located with easy connections to Tri-Rail and Metromover. The modern station includes a lounge, wifi and a parking garage.   (updated Dec 2019)\nThere is also a regional commuter rail system operating on a single route:\n 6 Tri Rail, \u260f +1 954 783-6030.  operates a regional rail service from Miami Airport up to Magnolia Park north of West Palm Beach via Fort Lauderdale, Boca Raton and Delray Beach. The train is connected to Miami International Airport and Ft Lauderdale Airport by shuttle bus or shuttle train. In Miami-Dade the train makes additional stops in 7 Hialeah Market Station; 8 Tri-Rail/MetroRail Transfer Station (nearest to Amtrak); 9 Opa Locka Station and 10 Golden Glades Station before crossing into Broward County towards Ft Lauderdale. Fares vary depending on how far you go. Tickets must be purchased before boarding the train from ticket vending machines at any of the stations or from ticket clerks at staffed stations. Tickets are checked on the trains and anyone found without a ticket is liable to a substantial fine.\n\n\n=== By car ===\nThere are three main highways coming into Miami. I-95 runs along the Atlantic coast of the United States and terminates in Miami. I-75 comes in from the midwestern United States and runs through Atlanta and Tampa before terminating in Miami. Florida's Turnpike is a toll road mainly useful for those driving in from Orlando. The only southbound route from Miami is U.S. Highway 1, which runs through the Florida Keys all the way to Key West.\n\n\n=== By bus ===\nMost of the local bus companies stop at Miami International Airport, the Intermodal Transportation Center (MIC) next to the airport, or the Cruise Terminal. Some of the companies may offer hotel pick ups and drop offs in Miami Beach, downtown or elsewhere. Check with them:\n\n Flixbus, (bus stops) (Multiple locations) (There are more than 3 separate stops in Miami and Miami Beach. Check tickets for specific location.). Connects with the Orlando area via Port St Lucie, W Palm Beach and Ft Lauderdale. Multiple departures daily. From $15. (updated Feb 2021)\n11 Greyhound Bus Lines, (bus station) 3801 W 21st (opposite side of the railroad tracks from the Intermodal Center; connected to Intermodal Center by pedestrian bridge), \u260f +1 305-871-1810, toll-free: +1-800-231-2222. Service from Atlanta, Orlando, Tampa, Naples and Jacksonville via Ft Lauderdale. They also go south to Key West via the Keys. They also have additional stops at 4450 NW 20th at NW 20th & Perimeter Rd and at American Chevron on 15821 NW 27th. \n Jet Set Express, (bus stop) Miami International Airport (Terminal J, Door 26 on the 2nd level), \u260f +1 407 649-4994. Venue at stop open 24/7. Thrice-daily departures to Ft Pierce, Kissimmee, Orlando from the Miami International Airport and the Regency Hotel near the airport. They also have additional stops in Miami Beach, the cruise terminal and downtown Miami. Check schedules as those other stops are serviced once or twice daily. (updated Jul 2019)\n Keys Shuttle, (shuttle stop) Ground level between Terminals D & E at MIA (walk across the first set of taxi lanes, then across the second set of lanes for private vehicles. Once you have crossed both sets of lanes, you get to a wide median where \u201cPublic Bus Terminal\u201d will be on your right hand side), \u260f +1 305-289-9997, toll-free: +1-888-765-9997. The company provides door-to-door service to the Keys from the Miami and Ft. Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airports (and vice versa). (updated Sep 2017)\n Miami to Key West Bus, Pre-arranged hotel pick up in Sunny Isle Beach, Miami Beach and downtown Miami, \u260f +1 305 423-9045. Daily. Pick up for Orlando 5AM to 6AM and to Key West begin at 7:15AM. Motorcoach transportation services and escorted tours to Key West from Miami.They also offer one way transportation services to Orlando and local bus/boat tours in Miami. (updated Sep 2017)\n Our Bus (Operated by different bus companies on contract to Our Bus), Terminal B of the Port of Miami Cruise Terminal, \u260f +1 844 800-6828. Operates service to/from Ft Lauderdale Airport, Tampa, Sarasota and Ft Myers. Fares range from $10 to $22 or more. \n Redcoach, (bus stop) 21 Miad Circle (Departure Level, Concourse H, red bus stop #5 at Miami International Airport), \u260f +1 407-851-2843, toll-free: +1-877-733-0724. Service from Tallahassee via Gainesville, Ocala, Orlando, W Palm Beach, Ft Lauderdale. They also run a separate route to Naples and Ft Myers from Miami. (updated Sep 2017)\n\n\n=== By boat ===\n12 Port of Miami. This is the world's busiest cruise port. Most passengers are shipping out (perhaps having flown in) for a cruise that will eventually return them to Miami, but one-way or open-jaw itineraries may be available. These are upmarket holidays in their own right, there are no point-to-point ferries to Miami. (updated Oct 2021)\n\n\n== Get around ==\n\n\n=== By public transit ===\n\nMiami's public transit system is the most diverse and extensive of any locality in Florida. If travel time is not a priority, it is possible to travel to all commercial areas and major attractions within Miami without a car. A map of transit run by Miami-Dade is available at this website.\nMiami's bus system covers the entire county and connects to bus lines serving Broward County and the Greater Fort Lauderdale area. Sometimes buses still have a hard time remaining on schedule. Most routes run about once every 20 minutes, while the most popular routes may run every 5-10 minutes, sometimes with service all night long. One useful route is the S, which connects downtown Miami to all of Miami Beach, terminating at Avenutra Mall in north Miami-Dade.\nThe Metrorail is an elevated rail system serving Miami and surrounding cities, running 22.4 mi with 23 stations on two lines (green and orange). It connects many areas of tourist interest, including downtown Miami, Miami International Airport (Orange line only), Dadeland Mall, Vizcaya Museum and Gardens, Lowe Art Museum, Miami Museum of Science, Village at Merrick Park and many other nearby shopping areas. Coconut Grove and downtown Coral Gables can be reached via short shuttle bus from various stations. The two Metrorail lines share common tracks through the core, before splitting near the airport. Metrorail operates between roughly 5AM and midnight, with a bus serving all Metrorail stations operating in the overnight hours, effectively providing 24-hour service.\nFare for a single trip on both Metrorail and Metrobus is $2.25 per ride, $1.10 for persons with disabilities or on Medicare (as of Apr 2025). Transfers between bus and rail are free. Express routes cost $2.65/$1.30. Day, weekly, and monthly pass are available. Contactless Payment of fares is also accepted in the Miami-Dade Transit Area, A FAQ page about contactless payment is also available. \nMiami-Dade Transit's fare card system is known as EASY Card. Though exact change/cash is still accepted on all Metrobus routes, an EASY Card is required for riding the Metrorail, and for using the free transfers offered between an unlimited number of bus routes, and a single Metrorail ride. EASY Cards costs $2 (Apr 2025). Alternatively, travelers may purchase an EASY ticket, which is almost identical to an EASY Card, except there is no activation fee, expires after 60 days, and can only hold $40. The fare card software does not allow passbacks. Additional information on fares, routes and schedules can be found here, or by \u260f +1 305 770-3131.\nDowntown Miami is served by a free, elevated people mover system known as Metromover, which connects to Metrorail at two stations: Government Center in the central business district, and Brickell Station in Brickell. Metromover is the most efficient way to move around Downtown Miami. It is a great way to take a rest when walking around downtown, and a great time to take pictures of the skyscrapers and growing Miami skyline from above.\nTri-Rail is a commuter rail system linking Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and West Palm Beach. There are 18 stations in and between those cities. Tri-Rail offers frequent trains (at least one per hour) on weekdays, and less frequent trains on weekends. Check the website or call +1-800-TRI-RAIL for stop and schedule information.\n\n\n=== By taxi ===\nTaxis are generally expensive, with a fixed $2.50 charge plus $0.40 for each sixth of a mile (fourth of a kilometer) traveled. Almost all local cab companies have fixed rates for travel to Miami Beach and other beach and nightclub communities popular with tourists, ranging from $30\u201360 depending on arrival location. For example, South Beach may be the most expensive, while a residential neighborhood in Miami Beach may be the cheapest. The charge is the same regardless of pick-up location on the mainland. All taxis are fitted with maps of the barrier islands which state the cost per location. The same applies for passengers leaving the islands onto the mainland, though normal rates apply for travel within the islands or within the mainland.\nService is available throughout Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach, and Monroe counties regardless of pick-up location. The normal service charges apply for these four counties, but it is wise to ask for a pre-determined price beforehand if leaving the county, as this will usually be cheaper and most drivers are willing to negotiate when leaving the county. If you wish to be taken to a location outside of those four counties, you must negotiate a price and advise the cab company first. Drivers may refuse to drive outside of the metropolitan area if they are not advised to do so beforehand.\nUsually you will have to call a cab company and request a pick-up. For safety and legal reasons, taxis operated by the major companies are not normally allowed to pick up passengers at random locations except at MIA, the Port of Miami, and train stations. Some individual taxi drivers will not follow this rule, however, so you can try hailing a taxi in the street. A significant and notable exception to this rule is the South Beach section of Miami Beach. For all intents and purposes, taxis can be flagged from the street on the island like one would in New York City. This trend has begun spreading into downtown Miami due to the increased redevelopment and foot traffic downtown, but should not be relied upon if you have a schedule to keep.\nAll taxi drivers must have a valid license to operate. It is uncommon to hear of crimes involving unlicensed taxis anywhere in the metropolitan area, since Dade County keeps track of all taxi activity in and around Miami and cooperates with other counties in getting this information. If you enter a cab and do not see a valid license placed in front of the passenger's seat, you should not enter the taxi and instead call another cab company regardless of what the driver says. If you willingly enter a taxi without a license or with an expired license and there is an incident or accident, it is possible that you may not be able to hold the driver accountable by law. When entering a cab you should make note of the driver's name, license number and cab number if any problems arise during the trip. This information should be easily found inside the taxi. It may be able to help you identify the cab driver to the police or the cab company.\n\n\n=== By car ===\nUnless you plan to stay downtown or in a single location elsewhere, you will find that a car is very convenient in Miami, and car rentals are cheap in comparison to other major US cities.\nSurface roads in Miami are usually easy to navigate. The area's roads are designed around a grid system, where most roads are numbered based on their distance from the city center. The two main axis roads are Miami Avenue (running north to south) and Flagler Street (running east to west). These two roads intersect in downtown Miami, the county's symbolic center. All avenues run north to south, while all streets run east to west.  For example, the address, \"9500 NW 30th Street\" would be at the intersection of NW 30th Street (to the west of Miami Avenue, and 30 blocks north of Flagler Street) and NW 95th Avenue (north of Flagler Street, and 95 blocks west of Miami Avenue). Most roads in Miami conform to this nomenclature, but due to the more than 30 municipalities within Miami-Dade County, there are a few exceptions to be aware of. Examples include Coral Gables, the Coconut Grove section of Miami (city proper), Miami Lakes, and Hialeah.  Hialeah is particularly notorious because it uses its own grid system, in addition to the overall county system. For example, NW 103rd Street is also marked as E 49th Street, or W 49th Street in Hialeah.\nIn Broward County, the roads are numbered based on their distance from the Fort Lauderdale city center, which is generally the same going east-west but will be very different going north-south. Most of the municipalities in Broward County use their own limited grid systems as well.  Some street names also change at the county line. The coastline highway, A1A, is known as \"Collins Avenue\" in Miami, but becomes \"Ocean Drive\" in Broward. Likewise, \"Red Road\" in Miami becomes \"Flamingo Road\" in Broward.\nMiami has four primary expressways. In addition to I-95 and Florida\u2019s Turnpike, there is state highway 836 (also known as the Dolphin Expressway) and state highway 826 (also known as the Palmetto Expressway). The Dolphin Expressway runs west from downtown Miami along the edge of Miami International Airport. The Palmetto Expressway and Florida's Turnpike form \"F\"-shaped loops around the city. The Turnpike continues north, roughly parallel to I-95, and will take you to Orlando if you keep driving. I-95, the Palmetto and the Turnpike intersect at a junction in North Miami called the Golden Glades. You may find driving in the Glades challenging, especially if you have little experience driving in it.\nThe area's drivers are particularly aggressive. This shouldn't discourage anyone from using the roadways, but a passive approach to Miami driving can save you from an unwanted exchange with another driver, or even worse an accident. Posted speed limits are ignored by most drivers, especially on larger roads with lower speed limits. Two examples are I-95 and state road 826 (the Palmetto Expressway). The eastern portion of state road 836 (the Dolphin Expressway) between Miami International Airport and downtown Miami handles traffic that exceeds its capacity, and contains several left-hand exits, including the eastbound off-ramp to Lejuene Road (NW 42nd Avenue), which is the posted route, and the quickest route to Miami International Airport.\n\n\n== See ==\n\n\n== Do ==\n\n\n=== Beaches ===\nOf course, if you're in Miami, you'll want to spend some time on the beach. The only beach inside Miami city limits is Virginia Beach. However, there are many other beaches nearby in South Florida, from Tequesta all the way to Key West. As Miami has pretty temperate weather, the beaches will be active all year round, but the water will usually be too cold for locals to swim in during winter. The city of Miami Beach is closest to Miami, on a barrier island across Biscayne Bay, and is most famous for its South Beach party scene. Topless sunbathing is allowed in Miami Beach, and if you want to take it all off, go to Haulover Beach in North Beach.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nThe Miami Marlins (baseball) play in the Little Havana neighborhood, while the Miami Heat (basketball) play in Downtown Miami. Three other major league teams play in the suburbs of Miami - the Miami Dolphins (American football) in Miami Gardens, and the Florida Panthers (hockey) and Inter Miami CF (soccer) in Broward County. Inter plans to open a new stadium near Miami International Airport in 2026.\nThe Miami area also has three major college sports programs. The Miami Hurricanes (University of Miami) play most sports at the university's campus in Coral Gables, but the football team plays at the Dolphins' stadium in Miami Gardens. The FIU Panthers (Florida International University) are located in the unincorporated area of University Park just to the west of the Miami city limits, and the Florida Atlantic Owls (also FAU Owls; Florida Atlantic University) are in Boca Raton in Palm Beach County.\nGrand Prix: Formula One motor racing is held in May at the Miami International Autodrome, a temporary street circuit set up at the Dolphins' home of Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens.\nTennis: Since 2019, Hard Rock Stadium has been the main stadium for the Miami Open, held in late March\u2013early April and one of the biggest events on the ATP (men's) and WTA (women's) tours outside of the four Grand Slam events.\n\n\n=== Events ===\nThere are very few city-wide events planned during Jul and Aug because of the high temperatures during the summer in Miami.\n\n Ultra Music Festival. Streets of downtown Miami. People from around the world flock to Miami every March for its notorious Ultra Music Festival. It\u2019s a three-day and -night festival that includes the most famous DJs in the music industry. Tickets usually range from $300\u2013600 from the three-day festival and increase in price as it gets closer to the show in March. The show sells out almost every year so be sure to get your tickets as soon as possible. \n Calle Ocho (Southwest 8th St. between 11th and 27th ave). The largest Hispanic street festival in Miami. It\u2019s a one-day festival that features contests, concerts and food. There is also a carnival that takes place in a lot to the left of Florida International University\u2019s main entrance. The carnival is on the same day as Calle Ocho. The festival is usually held in March on Calle Ocho. It is free except for parking if you bring your car. \n Carnaval Miami. A festival that consists of ten events along the course of ten days during the weeks of late February and early March. The Kiwanis club of little Havana (little Cuba) hosts this festival full of music, international foods, concerts, sports, culinary competitions, galas and upscale Latin jazz festival. \n Independence Day. City-wide.  Held on July 4. The Miami skyline is illuminated by fireworks on the \u201cbirth date\u201d of the United States.  While Key Biscayne has great views of the fireworks show, Bayfront Park has live music as well as a laser show. \n King Mango Strut, Main Avenue and Grand Avenue in Coconut Grove, \u260f +1 305 401-1171. Held after Christmas, this parade began as a parody of current events as well as the Orange Bowl Parade. The Orange Bowl Parade, unlike its famous Rose Bowl counterpart, is no longer held anymore, but the King Mango Strut is still having a good time making fun of the previous year\u2019s follies. \n\n\n== Learn ==\nMiami-Dade College, with more than 165,000 students, is the U.S.' largest institution of higher learning, and one of the country's best community college systems. This community college has locations in Hialeah, Homestead, Kendall, Downtown Miami, and North Miami and also has locations all around Miami proper. In Coral Gables is the University of Miami, one of the best-known universities in Florida. One of the state's largest universities, Florida International University (more commonly FIU), is in University Park, just to the west of the Miami city limits.\n\n\n== Work ==\nIf you are not from the U.S., you will need a work visa. If you try to work while holding a tourist visa, you are still considered an illegal immigrant in the U.S. Immigration and Nationalization Services conduct frequent illegal immigrant checks in Miami businesses since Miami has numerous refugees from Cuba, Haiti and other nearby countries. If you don\u2019t have the right visa, you may not get a job in Miami.\nThere is an exception to getting work without a visa in Miami, however.  Since yachts and cruise ships sail on international waters, these companies can freely hire any person they like.  Non-US citizens will still require a valid seaman's visa, however, to land in US ports.\n\n\n== Buy ==\nThere are a few shopping malls in the city of Miami, but more spread out across Miami-Dade County, including South Beach.\nThere is a 7% sales tax in Miami.\n\n\n=== Groceries and other basics ===\nThe major supermarket chains in Miami are Publix, Walmart, Winn Dixie, Sedanos, Fresco Y M\u00e1s, and Aldi. In addition many specialty and organic supermarkets such as Whole Foods Market, Trader Joe's, and Fresh Market can also be found in Miami.\n\n\n== Eat ==\nFoodies and chefs alike herald Miami for its unique American cuisine. Created in the 1990s, the cuisine alternatively known as New World, Nuevo Latino or Florribean cuisine blends local produce, Latin American and Caribbean culinary tradition and the technical skills required in European cooking. Nuevo Latino is said to be the brainchild of four chefs: Allen Susser, Norman Van Aken, Mark Militello and Douglas Rodriguez. All of them still work in Miami and most of them work at the restaurants they created in the 1990s. New World is not restricted to these chefs\u2019 menus. This cuisine influences several restaurants around the city to this day.\nMiami may be known for its Latin American cuisine (especially its Cuban cuisine but also cuisines from South American countries such as Colombia), but there are other different kinds of restaurants to be found around the city. In addition to stand-alone Chinese, Japanese, Middle Eastern, and Italian (among others) restaurants, there are caf\u00e9s, steakhouses and restaurants operating from boutique hotels, as well as chain restaurants such as TGI Fridays and Ben & Jerry\u2019s.\nMiami is known for having nightclubs double as restaurants throughout the city. Most of these restaurants, such as Tantra, BED and the Pearl Restaurant and Champagne Lounge (attached to Nikki Beach), are found throughout South Beach. However, some of these restaurants/nightclubs like Grass Lounge can be found in the Design District (north of downtown but south of North Miami).\nIf many of Miami\u2019s premiere restaurants don\u2019t fit into your daily budget, consider eating during Miami Restaurant Month (better known as Miami Spice) in August and September.\nMiami\u2019s dining scene reflects burgeoning diversity, mixing exotic newcomer restaurants with long-standing institutions, often seasoned by Latin influence and hot winds of the Caribbean. New World cuisine, a culinary counterpart to accompany Miami\u2019s New World Symphony, provides a loose fusion of Latin, Asian, and Caribbean flavors utilizing fresh, area-grown ingredients. Innovative restaurateurs and chefs similarly reel in patrons with Floribbean-flavored seafood fare, while keeping true to down-home Florida favorites.\nDon't be fooled by the plethora of super lean model types you're likely to see posing throughout Miami. Contrary to popular belief, dining in this city is as much a sport as the in-line skating on Ocean Drive. With over 6,000 restaurants to choose from, dining out in Miami has become a passionate pastime for locals and visitors alike. Its star chefs have fused Californian-Asian with Caribbean and Latin elements to create a world-class flavor all its own: Floribbean. Think mango chutney splashed over fresh swordfish or a spicy sushi sauce served alongside Peruvian ceviche.\nWhatever you're craving, Miami's got it\u2014with the exception of decent Chinese food and a New York-style slice of pizza. On the mainland\u2014especially in Coral Gables, and, more recently, downtown and on Brickell Avenue\u2014you can also experience fine, creative dining without the pretense.\nThere are several Peruvian restaurants at SW 88th Street and SW 137th Avenue in Kendale Lakes. Take the 88 or 288 buses from Dadeland North train station. This is kind of out of the way, but it is worth it.\n\n\n== Drink ==\nNightlife in Miami consists of upscale hotel clubs, independent bars frequented by locals (including sports bars) and nightclubs. Most hotel bars and independent bars turn the other cheek at your physical appearance, but you have to dress to impress (which does not mean dress like a stripper) to get into a nightclub. Also remember to never, under any circumstances, insult the doormen and/or nightclub employees that will grant you entry or touch the velvet ropes or you may as well be sitting on the opposite side of the clamoring masses trying to get in. Attempting to tip the doormen and claiming that you know employees that work in the nightclubs (unless you actually called and reserved a table or a spot on the VIP list) is also considered an affront. Getting to the club unfashionably early and pushing through the crowd (and not the doormen) also can help make you stand out in the crowd. Finally, most nightclubs won\u2019t admit groups of men unless those men are waiting in front of a gay bar. Bring some women or leave the pack if you\u2019re desperate to get in. And once you get in, remember that the charge to get in these clubs can cost up to $20\u2014cash only (some clubs, however, mercifully have ATMs\u2014that can charge up to $7 for a withdrawal). Popular drinks in Miami include the Cuba Libre and the mojito.\n\n\n== Sleep ==\nMiami is known for its boutique hotels (especially those in South Beach). Designers such as Ian Schrager (the Delano, Shore Club), Andr\u00e9 Balazs (Raleigh, Standard on Belle Isle) and Todd Oldham (the Hotel) helped put South Beach on the map with their creative hotel designs. The downside of many of the boutique hotels is that rooms can be small, particularly if the building was built during the height of the Art Deco period in Miami. If you value space, a boutique hotel may not be the type of hotel for you. If you don't need to stay in a boutique hotel (and value space), Miami has several upscale high-rise hotels north and south of South Beach, as well as near the downtown area. Miami does have its share of less costly chain hotels for those who value space and/or money.\nThe high season for hotels is around Nov to Apr because of the lower temperatures. However, Miami's lower temperatures, in comparison to the majority of the United States around this time, are still warm. High season is also marked by the advent of many Miami events, such as the Winter Music Conference and Spring Break. If you wish to reserve a room during Miami\u2019s high season, especially at a boutique hotel or a hotel on South Beach, you should book months in advance.\nHotels must charge a 12.5% room tax and some hotels may add a 15% service charge which may or may not be added if you reserve a room through the hotel, through a travel agent or agency (either in person or using an online site).\nThe cost of services in hotels can be pricey just like hotels elsewhere in the world but you can seek out local services within walking distances or online such as the popular  Oliom. laundry service for hotel guests .\nSome hotels offer garage or valet parking; check with your hotel about parking before booking a room if you wish to drive around Miami.\n\n\n== Connect ==\nMiami-Dade County is served by an overlay complex of two area codes: 305 and 786. This means that 10-digit dialing is always required. The overlay also applies to the Florida Keys (Monroe County).\n\n\n=== Internet ===\nIn addition to some of the places listed in Eat and Miami International Airport, several hotels have internet access\u2014both LAN connections and wireless\u2014but it is not free in all hotels. Check with your hotel to see if internet access is free or for a fee.\nSeveral cafes have wireless internet connections, but depending on the caf\u00e9 internet access may incur a fee. Unless it\u2019s a nation-wide chain offering free internet access like Starbucks, check with your caf\u00e9 to inquire about whether your internet access is charged separately from your meal.\nThere has been talk of free wireless to be installed all over Miami Beach and the Miami-Dade area, but nothing has been done about this yet.\n\nMiami-Dade Public Library System, \u260f +1 305 535-4219 (main branch number) \u2013 Free Wi-Fi at any of the system\u2019s libraries.\n D\u2019Vine Cyber Lounge, 910 Collins Ave, \u260f +1 305-674-8525. Local area connection $5, Wi-Fi $3 (without purchase of food). \n\n\n== Stay safe ==\nMiami's crime rate is a routine topic of news media, but the city is only relatively dangerous for the passing tourist in certain areas. Almost all crime is related to the illegal drug trade, owing to Miami's proximity to the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea, which makes it a major transit point for narcotics from South America. Overtown (next to Liberty City) has the highest violent crime rate in the city and is best avoided altogether. Little Haiti is also best avoided at night. If you are in any crime-afflicted neighborhood, take the same precautions as you would in other dangerous neighborhoods in the US: mind your own business, be aware of your surroundings at night and in high-traffic areas, get to your destination quickly, and avoid wearing flashy jewelry and electronics.\n\n\n=== Emergency numbers ===\nThe emergency telephone number for fire, police and rescue emergencies is 911.  If you require non-emergency assistance, do not call 911.  To contact police in a non-emergency situation, call +1 305 4POLICE.\n\n\n== Cope ==\n\n\n=== Consulates ===\nThere are a lot of consulates in Miami. In addition to the list below, the consulates for Barbados, Colombia, El Salvador, Italy, Monaco (Honorary), Norway (Honorary), Spain and Thailand (Honorary) are in nearby Coral Gables and the consulates (all honorary) for the Czech Republic, Denmark, Mali, the Philippines and Sweden are in Fort Lauderdale, about 30 minutes' drive to the north.

        "title": "Santiago",
        "extract": "Santiago is the capital and economic center of Chile. With its many museums, events, theaters, restaurants, bars and other entertainment and cultural opportunities, it is also the cultural center of the country. For visitors it's both the gateway to the country and a destination in its own right with an eclectic architecture, a vibrant culinary and cultural scene, surrounded by the mighty Andes welcoming skiers, trekkers and friends of wine. Its central location in the country makes it a great base for visiting other areas, and it is possible to ski in the nearby Andes and later be on the beach in the same day.\n\n\n== Districts ==\n\n \n\n\n== Understand ==\n\nSantiago is a fast-growing city in the Santiago Regi\u00f3n Metropolitana, in the central valley of Chile between the Andes mountain range to the east and the Coastal Range to the west. The metropolitan area has about 7 million inhabitants.\nFounded in 1541 as Santiago de Nueva Extremadura by the Spaniard Pedro de Valdivia, it has been the heart of the country since colonial times and has evolved to the cosmopolitan city it is today. \n\n\n=== History ===\nThe Santiago valley has been inhabited for thousands of years by different tribes. The Inca empire, and with them the Inca road network, extended here in the late 15th century. Not long after emerged the Spanish conquistadors, and on February 12, 1541, Pedro de Valdivia founded \"Santiago de Nueva Extremadura\" as the capital of the Captaincy General of Chile. During the following centuries functioned as the headquarters of the Spanish for their wars against the native Mapuche people further south, during which time the city was ruined two times by earthquakes.\nFrom the 19th century onwards, Santiago followed a similar path as many other South American cities. Independence was followed by rapid expansion and modernization and many of the city's major buildings, cultural institutions and parks were established at this time. Also the railway network to other parts of the country was greatly expanded. European immigration was from the 1930s onwards followed by immigrants from rural Chile and the city already had 3 million inhabitants by the middle of the 20th century.\nThe next major event in the city's history took place in 1973, when Marxist president Allende was ousted in a military coup. The military dictatorship that followed lasted until 1990. Today, Chile is a safe, democratic and stable country and one of the richest in Latin America.\n\n\n=== Geography ===\nSantiago sits in the middle of the Maipo river valley, at the place where it is joined by its tributary Mapocho, and the city is surrounded by mountains of various elevations, the highest of them Tupungato (6,570 m). Many of them are active volcanoes, and the soil has been covered in ash for millennia making it very fertile and high-quality grapes and other fruits are widely grown just outside the city.\nThe city sits between 400 and 540 meters above the sea level, but with many \"hill islands\" here and there including Santa Lucia, Cerro Calan and Cerro San Cristobal, the most emblematic top of the city. The Andes on the east side are noticeably higher than the Chilean Coastal Range on the west, wherefore east and west are often referred to as \"up\" or \"down\" by locals.\nThe administrative conurbation of Santiago is made up of 37 municipalities, of which the most important is Santiago Centro, where the main public institutions of the country and the old town are found. The east of the city is the financial center of the country.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nLike most of the central part in the country, Santiago has a typical Mediterranean climate. The climate is chilly and rainy in the winter, and temperatures can fall to around 0\u00b0C at night. It very rarely snows in the city itself, and during the winter it will more likely be raining with snow falling to the east up in the Andes. It gets progressively hotter towards the summer. Summers are fairly dry although you may experience some humidity at times, and temperatures can surpass 35\u00b0C. Due to the relative lack of vegetation in the region, temperatures fluctuate wildly between day and night year-round. It is not uncommon to suffer from the heat in shorts and a short-sleeved shirt during the day but require a jacket at night.\nSantiago is notorious for its poor air quality, which is due to the inversion effect in the basin and other factors. The air quality can be unhealthy in large part due to high concentrations of particulate matter (especially in the winter).\n\n\n=== Visitor information ===\n1 Sernatur (State Tourism Agency), Av Providencia 1550, \u260f +56 2 27318336, +56 2 27318337. The main visitor information office. \nInformation on Santiago from Chile Travel website\n\n\n== Get in ==\nUpon entry, all tourists are issued a tourist card good for 90 days. Take care not to lose the stamped tourist card as it is required to exit the country. If you happen to lose it you must get it reissued by the PDI (Polic\u00eda de Investigaciones) before attempting to leave the country.\n\n\n=== By plane ===\n\nSee also: Arturo Merino Ben\u00edtez International Airport\n1 Aeropuerto Internacional Comodoro Arturo Merino Ben\u00edtez (SCL  IATA, also known as Pudahuel Airport after the municipality it's in). Is the main Chilean gateway for international flights. The travel time to the city center has been drastically reduced with the construction of a tollway, the Costanera Norte.   \nAeropuerto Internacional Comodoro Arturo Merino Ben\u00edtez has flights from most continents, with major flight routes to North America, Europe, the Middle East and is the only South American airport to have flights to Oceania. The airport is also a major hub for Latin America.\nTravelers from Albania and Mexico, must pay a reciprocity fee upon entry to the country by air. This is in response to these same countries' visa fees for Chilean citizens. The one-time charge must be paid in cash (US dollars) or credit card before passing through immigration and is valid for the life of the passport. The fee for Albanians is US$30, and US$23 for Mexicans. There is no fee to enter by land. If paying by cash be aware that the bills must be in near \"perfect\" condition, no ripped bills.\nThere are taxis waiting immeditiately outside the terminal.\nThere are two public bus companies that run into town: Centropuerto and Turbus. You can purchase a one-way ticket for 2,000 pesos. Follow the signs to the bus terminal. It is a 5-minute walk from arrivals.\nThere is also the public Red bus line 555 that runs between the metro station Pajaritos and the parking space for the employees of the airport. It works with the Metro card and a ride with the bus (or bus+metro) counts as a standard ride (<= 800 pesos). The card can be bought and charged at Metro stations, but not in the bus. From the parking space runs a free shuttle bus to the terminals.\nTransvip and WeTransport offer shared and private transport to and from the airport.\nIf you are renting a car, the rental car company counters are all together to your left after clearing customs in the international terminal. There is a separate set of rental car counters before customs (so you can rent a car while waiting at the baggage claim), but they are not always staffed. After you get your contract, you have to walk outside, turn left, and walk east, then cross the street to the south to a small lot where the rental cars are kept and present your contract to the attendant on duty to obtain your rental car. When you return the vehicle, you must return to the same lot. Because the airport rental car lot is far too small, traffic jams and delays are frequent, so arrive early. At return, the attendant inspects the vehicle and fills out a return checklist form in carbon copy, then gives you one of the copies, which you bring back to the inside counter to close out your contract.\n\n\n=== By train ===\n\nTrenes Metropolitanos provides multiple commuter and interregional trains from the 2 Estaci\u00f3n Central  train station (Metro Estaci\u00f3n Central, Line 1) to the vast wine and agriculture valley to the south. The central station, designed by Gustave Eiffel, used to be the center of an extensive passenger railway network, which has been closed down just like in the rest of South America.\n\nMetrotren is a commuter rail that runs to San Fernando by way of Rancagua with five departures daily, prices up to 2,400 pesos.\nTerraSur runs to Chill\u00e1n with three departures daily. It is recommended to book ahead during the high season (Austral summer) as seats fill up quickly. Prices are up to 22,000 pesos for first class and 10,800 pesos for second class.\nExpreso Maule runs an interregional express service to the sixth and seventh regions (O'Higgins and Maule) once daily, prices up to 3,850 pesos.\n\n\n=== By car ===\nEntering Santiago by car, you'll probably find yourself on the Autopista Central (Ruta 5), the Chilean leg of the Pan-American Highway. To use this freeway you need a \"TAG\" toll transponder, or a day pass which you can buy from service stations. One-day passes are 7,000 pesos. You can also buy it after accidentally passing through it without one.\nIf you rent a car at the airport or anywhere in Santiago, the rental car company is required to include a TAG toll transponder in the vehicle and charge you for it.\n\n\n=== By bus ===\nBuses are the main mode of transportation between cities, and most cities in Chile have a bus connection to the capital. For some close, large cities, like Valparaiso or Vi\u00f1a del Mar there may be a bus departing as frequently as every 15 minutes. Prices of bus tickets vary according to demand and type of seat (regular seat, semi-bed or bed). Buses are in general clean and comfortable, but this may not always be the case with the toilets on board. There are several bus terminals in the city, the biggest being Terminal Santiago.\nThe bus ride between Santiago and Mendoza in Argentina has beautiful views and takes about eight hours, depending on the time spent at the Cristo Redentor checkpoint. The border crossing is at about 2,800 m in the Andes. Fruit, vegetables or animal products are not allowed in either direction; all luggage will get checked at the border. One-way fares are listed at around 21,000 pesos (semicama) 25,000 pesos (cama) in high season, but are often cheaper if booked in advance and in the off season. There are also buses to and from San Juan (one way fares listed at around 19,500 pesos) and Neuquen, Argentina. One-way fares to Lima are listed at around 85,000 pesos.\n\n3 Terminal Santiago (Estaci\u00f3n Central, ex Terminal Sur), Avda. Lib. Bernardo O'Higgins 3850, Alameda 3848, (Metro Universidad de Santiago [Line 1]), \u260f +56-2-23761750, +56 2 23761755. Bus companies serving international and domestic destinations are in the Terminal Santiago. In the terminal there is a food court with local fast food restaurants and a McDonald's. May be extremely overcrowded prior to and on national holiday. Not dangerous, but be beware of pickpockets and people trying to sell you stolen goods (iPods and cell phones are a common target). \n\n4 Terminal Alameda, Avda. Lib. Bernardo O'Higgins 3750 (Metro Universidad de Santiago, Metro Estaci\u00f3n Central [Line 1]), \u260f +56-2-22707425, +56 2 27762424. Turbus and Pullman operate at this private station for domestic and international departures. There is a hotel and a few convenience shops in the terminal. \n5 Terrapuerto Los H\u00e9roes, Tucapel Jim\u00e9nez 21 (Metro Los H\u00e9roes [Line 1]), \u260f +56-2-24239530, +56 2 24200099. A few kilometers east of the main terminals is the Terminal Los H\u00e9roes. Services to the north and to Mendoza. Of note here is the bus line Cruz del Sur, which is one of the few companies with regularly scheduled departures to towns in Argentine Patagonia and Punta Arenas. \n6 Terminal San Borja, San Borja 184 (Metro Estaci\u00f3n Central), \u260f +56-2-27760645. Services to the north of the country, Litoral Central and the western part of the Santiago region. \n7 Terminal Pajaritos (Metro Pajaritos). Services to Vi\u00f1a del Mar, Valpara\u00edso and the airport. \n\n\n== Get around ==\n\n\n=== Transantiago ===\nTransantiago runs the metro and main bus lines in the city. Fares on public transport can be paid only with a bip! card. Bip! cards can be bought and recharged at any metro station (1,550 pesos for the card, minimum recharge 1,000 pesos) or at a Centro bip!. They are good for both the metro and bus and allows you unlimited transfers between the two within a two hour period \u2014 you still have to swipe your card when boarding the next metro train or bus, but there is in general no deduction. In the peak period, when traveling with a ticket activated on a metro and you're transferring to a bus (or the other way around) there will be a small deduction.\nYou cannot return the card nor get a refund, think twice before adding too much money. However, you can use the card for several people, you just have to swipe for the second person as well. So, you might decide to only get one instead of two if you are traveling together. The free transfer between metro and bus for the other person does probably not work then.\nThe fare depends on when you've started your journey; tickets cost 800 pesos for trips commenced during the peak periods (07:00-09:00, 18:00-20:00), 720 pesos for shoulder periods (06:30-07:00, 09:00-18:00, 08:00-20:45) and 640 pesos for low periods (before 06:30 and after 20:45).\n\n\n==== By metro ====\nThe Santiago Metro system is the second largest in Latin America and has seven lines and 136 stations, with many holding rotating art exhibitions. The lines 1, 2 and 5 pass through the historical center and 4 and 4A mostly serve the east of the city. As it is a very popular mode for getting around, the metro can be crowded during rush hours.\nTrains run between roughly 06:00 and 23:00; each station posts the exact hours above the staircases leading down into the stations. Buses run parallel to subway lines after hours.\n\n\n==== By bus ====\nTransantiago buses are mostly modern and run around the clock on the main lines. If you know a little Spanish, you can find route information on the Transantiago website.\nOn Sundays 10:00\u201318:00, Transantiago operates a \"cultural circuit\" , where a specially-marked bus runs between major tourist and cultural destinations for the normal fare.\n\n\n=== By taxi ===\nTaxis are a relatively inexpensive and safe way to get around the city. Flag drop costs 300 pesos plus 120 pesos for every 100 meters. Official taxis are black and yellow and easily identifiable. Radiotaxis are also common and a good idea late at night. Suburban areas are sometimes served by taxis operating fixed routes and fixed rates. There are many Uber taxis, but they are not officially licensed in Chile, and Uber drivers will not want to pick you up or drop you off where either police or licensed taxis can see them. Getting to/from the airport by Uber is particularly awkward. Official taxis are a similar rate anyway.\n\n\n=== By bike ===\nSantiago has a rapidly-growing network of bike lanes and paths. Bicineta has an up to date map of bike routes.\n\n Bikesantiago. Bike sharing program with monthly and annual memberships. Must register to use the service. \n\n\n=== By tour bus ===\n   Turistik Santiago Hop on \u2013 Hop off, \u260f +56 2 28201000. 09:30\u201318:00. A red double-decker bus that passes through the main tourist attractions of the city, including the Central Market, Plaza de Armas, Bellavista, and Parque Metropolitana, among others. Pass is good for the day with departures every half hour during operating hours. 19,000 pesos. \n\n\n== See ==\nSee #Districts for listings.\n\nThe Historical Center is the place to go for historical sights. For over five centuries this has been a governmental seat, and you can find buildings of great historical significance here. One of them is the modernist colonial Palacio de la Moneda, built for minting of coins. From the mid-19th century it has also been the residence of the president until the coup of 1973 when it was bombed. The damage was repaired and it's still the residence of the president today.\nSouth of the palace is Alameda, the main drag of the city with the central university building (Casa Central de la Universidad de Chile), the San Francisco church and the Santa Lucia hill with great views of the old town. Plaza de Armas opposite the university building is the most lively area of the downtown and in addition to vendors you can often find artists, comedians and singers performing here. Nearby you can find the Metropolitan Cathedral, the Palace of the Royal Court (nowadays a museum) and the mayor's residence.\n\nGoing north from Plaza de Armas you'll come to the Mercado Central, with plenty of restaurants. East along the Mapocho river's southern bank you'll be at Parque Forestal and Museo de Bellas Artes as well as the vibrant neighborhood of Lastarria with plenty of caf\u00e9s, restaurants and art galleries.\nBellavista north of the river is a nightlife hotspot and there you can also visit the mythical home of the poet Pablo Neruda. You can also take the funicular or walk up the Cerro San Crist\u00f3bal for some of the best views of Santiago and the Maipo Valley. Southeast there is Providencia where you can find trendy shops and further away Sanhattan's skyscrapers including Gran Torre Santiago, the tallest in Latin America and second tallest in the Southern Hemisphere. Westwards there's Quinta Normal, a huge park surrounded by museums.\n\n\n== Do ==\nSee #Districts for listings.\n\nSantiago is known as a cultural hotspot. Among other things, the city is home to an impressive jazz scene, with several intimate clubs scattered throughout the city, a famous one being Club Jazz in the Nu\u00f1oa district. In the Providencia district a jazz festival takes place each January with both local and foreign bands playing. For current theater, dance, and concert listings can be found in the El Mercurio newspaper. For a broad variety of art and culture, visit one of several cultural centers around the city, featuring exhibitions, performances and workshops. At some of these you can buy local art and handicraft too (refer to the Buy section for more shopping).\nYou can also take a pleasant walk in one of Santiago's many parks. Some of these, like Cerro Santa Lucia and Parque Metropolitano offer great views over the city. If you want something more than just hiking or taking the cable car up a little hill, take on the higher \"hills\" outside the city. Contact one of the local mountaineering clubs and go on a trek to some of the highest mountains in the world outside Asia, or if you like skiing, hit the slopes of El Colorado (Chile).\n Vineyards. While you are outside downtown, Central Chile is also famous for its wines and wineries. Some noteworthy ones are Cousi\u00f1o Macul and Concha y Toro. Casablanca Wine Valley (e.g. Vi\u00f1a Emiliana) is only about 1 hour to the west of Santiago and home to the best white wine in the country.

Rent a car for 1 or 2 days from Santiago and go visit the wineries near Los Andes, the beautiful Uspallata Pass with Monumento del Cristo Redentor, the Aconcagua Provincial Park for some hiking, the impressive El Puente del Inca and/or even laid-back Mendoza and its vineyards. The pass road itself is gravel road and a detour from the tunnel which most people use between Chile and Argentina. The views from the pass into Chile and Argentina are breathtaking, and the drive itself is exciting (not just along the gravel road). If you rent the car at around 16:00 and start in the morning near Los Andes or even closer to the pass, it might be better due to lesser clouds in the morning. Note, the border crossing into Argentina, which is 10 km or so behind the actual border, can take 2-6 hr with cars queuing for many kilometres before the tunnel underneath the pass. Since you actually do not want to take the tunnel, you should find a way to pass the waiting cars, maybe with the help of a local border police car. The gravel road to the pass starts about 100 m before the tunnel. If you just go to the Uspallata Pass and return to Chile without entering Argentina, do not tell the customs office on the way back that you went to see the Christ statue\u2014it seems that the statue is on the Argentinian side. On the way back, you will be checked by customs for not allowed goods and food, even if you did not cross into Argentina\u2014so, best to leave everything (even the wine) in Chile before you go to the pass. US$30 per day car rental fee. (updated Apr 2018)\n\n\n== Work ==\nIn order to work legally in Chile, a working permit needs to be obtained, which can be accomplished with the sponsorship of an employer. Many people work illegally, but it is definitely best to have a permit.\n\n\n== Buy ==\nSee #Districts for listings.\nSantiago has a lot of shopping malls all around the city. In the malls you can find a variety of retail stores and Falabella, Par\u00eds and Ripley, the most famous department stores in Chile.\n\n\n=== Downtown and Providencia ===\nFor shopping in central Santiago, head to Paseo Ahumada, a section full of different shops between the main street Alameda and Plaza de Armas.\nIf you prefer buying handcrafts, the ones in the Centro Artesanal Santa Lucia are good and relatively cheap compared with other handcrafts stores. Other handcrafts centres are in Bellavista (though a bit more expensive).\nProvidencia has a large selection of shops along Avenida Providencia.\n\n\n=== East ===\n\nThe largest malls are Parque Arauco and Alto Las Condes, both have good restaurants and the former also has free music and shows. You can get to Parque Arauco from Metro Escuela Militar (Line 1) and to Alto Las Condes from Metro Los Dom\u00ednicos (Line 1); ask locals for directions if you're unsure of how to take buses.\nAlonso de C\u00f3rdova Street and Nueva Costanera Avenue are very exclusive areas where you can find high fashion and luxury stores like Louis Vuitton, Herm\u00e9s or local designers. In this area you find great restaurants and art galleries.\nSteps from Metro Los Dom\u00ednicos (Line 1) is Pueblito Los Dom\u00ednicos. It is more expensive but has a wide variety of local handcrafts and antiques, as well as a small exhibition room and a bonsai exhibition behind it. It is very pretty with an artificial stream in a colonial-looking atmosphere. Half of the people there are usually tourists during the summer, so you won't be alone!\nPlaza Nu\u00f1oa has some small shops in the plaza where you can buy books from Latin America (Neruda, Allende, Cortazar) and also handcrafts.\n\n\n=== North ===\nIf you're already kind of familiar with Santiago, you can also go to Barrio Patronato which is near the downtown area and it's easy to reach by metro (Metro Patronato, Line 2). There you'll find cheap clothes, food and products of all kinds, as well as some foreign stores (mainly Chinese, Koreans, Peruvians and from the Middle East), thus allowing you to save quite a bit of money. It would be better to go alongside a local, though, since it's easy to get lost due to the very short and slim streets and the very high quotient of visitors. Beware of pickpocketers.\n\n\n=== South ===\nSimilarly, those who want more surprises and know the basics about Santiago can go to the famous Persa Bio Bio in the Franklin area, also not too far from downtown and near to Metro Franklin (Line 2). It can be described as a giant flea market that opens every weekend and offers antiques, tools, handmade furniture, many food stores, etc. Again, it's not a place for novices: a local's presence would be desired.\n\n\n== Eat ==\nSee #Districts for listings.\n\nIn downtown and the east of the city you can find both global and domestic fast food chains. Why not opt for the latter and have a completo, the Chilean version of the hot dog with tomato, mayonnaise, sauerkraut or a italiano hot dog with tomato, avocado and mayonnaise. In addition there are small sandwich places known as \"picadas\" serving different kinds of sandwiches (some of them with huge steaks) and pies. There are also street food carts where you can find local specialties like sopaipillas (buns) stuffed with fried pumpkin and mote con huesillo, a soft drink with peaches and wheat.\nThe traditional cuisine of central Chile is centered around barbecued meat (beef or pork) with tomatoes, potatoes or corn. Local specialties include cazuela (a soup), porotos con riendas (beans with pasta), porotos granados (a vegetarian bean stew), charquic\u00e1n (stew of beef and potatoes, topped with an egg), pastel de choclo (corn pie) and as we're in southern South America \u2014 asado (barbecued meat). Seafood is not as common in Santiago as you might expect, though if you want some, the restaurants at the central market are the place to go.\nYou can get vegetarian and vegan food but it will likely be some version of pizza, pasta, and burgers.\n\n\n== Drink ==\nSee #Districts for listings.\nNightlife choices vary widely across the city and their location usually reflects their price and style.\n\nBarrio Bellavista and Barrio Brasil are popular spots close to downtown. The Bohemian Bellavista can be reached by Metro to Baquedano, or by bus to Plaza Italia. Cross the bridge will bring you to Pio Nono, which probably has highest density of bars, pubs, and clubs in Chile, including some LGBT places. By law, everything closes down at 05:00, though you may be able to join people for afterparties elsewhere.\nBarrio Lastarria has more sophisticated and relaxed bars, pubs, caf\u00e9s, many of which have an interesting history. It's also a district for fine dining.\nThe historic center likewise has many traditional places to have a drink, some of which have retained an ambience from the early 20th century. One of them is La Piojera, with its signature terremoto (earthquake) drink with wine, Fernet and pineapple ice cream.\nPlaza San Enrique is a park in Lo Barnechea (at the far northeast of the city) which is surrounded by nightclubs. The most popular one is Sala Murano (it can get very crowded!) People who attend are mostly aged 18-25 and it is one of the safest places to party. Most people there are from upper-middle to high class, so it is more expensive than other neighbourhoods. Typically, women get in for free, while men pay around 3,000-5,000 pesos. You can get there by buses, but though buses do pass later on, you might have to wait up to an hour for it.\nPlaza \u00d1u\u00f1oa is a district east of the central area and is another popular spot nightlife spot.\nVitacura is pretty far east (towards the Andes). It is composed of bars and some places where you can dance. The places are nice and it can be fun to go. It is more expensive that other areas of Santiago and frequented by people that live in the eastern (wealthier) side of the city. Although you can get there by bus, it will be hard to leave on anything but a taxi since buses don't run late.\n\n\n== Sleep ==\nSee #Districts for listings.\n\nAll types of accommodation, from top class hotels to backpacker hostels are available. As a general rule, lodging gets more luxurious and expensive the further east you travel.\nClassic, mid-range hotels can be found downtown, and in the nearby residential areas such as Barrio Brasil you'll find more affordable accommodation like youth hostels. Lastarria just east of downtown features small boutique hotels. In the eastern part of the city you can find hotels of international luxury chains and apartment hotels, catering to those who attend business meetings, conferences or trade shows. Still further east, outside the city and up the mountains there are the upscale ski resorts.\n\n\n== Stay safe ==\nSantiago is infamous for its smog, which is worse during the winter (May\u2013September). The locals welcome the rain which falls during winters as it cleans the air. Be sure to carry bottled water with you during the summer. Be prepared for sauna-heat on the metro during summer.\n\n\n=== When getting around ===\nBy South American standards Santiago is a safe city, but visitors should be aware of pickpocketing and other petty crimes (Chileans derogatorily refer to the pickpockets as \"lanzas\", from the verb \"lanzar\", \"to throw upon\" in English). Avoid parks at night and don't wear expensive looking jewelry or watches even during the day, unless you are in Las Condes or Vitacura. If you're alone, avoid large crowds of people, especially downtown.\nIf you happen to have bad luck and get robbed, do as you're told by the criminal and if you don't understand Spanish, give away the wallet. Not doing so can provoke an attack until you give away your wallet. Don't try to stand up to them and once again: do as you're told.\nKeep your camera concealed, use it to take a photo and then hide it while not using it. If you're getting robbed and the criminal has spotted the camera expect to give it away too if you want to stay out of trouble.\nIf someone approaches you on the streets and promises to get you better chances at changing your dollars or euros into Chilean pesos, never accept their deals. They're con-people who take advantage of foreigners not knowing the details about currency and confuse them with big words to take their cash away. Only change your money in legal currency exchange centers, which may take more time but are much more trustworthy. There's one in the airport, but they are also easy to find in the downtown and financial areas, or in the malls.\nOverall, Santiago is very safe if you travel by car.\nThe metro is regarded as safer for travelling amongst the locals, even though security has increased in the buses after the introduction of TranSantiago. But some locals still prefer using the metro especially when it gets darker, since almost all the stations have guards. Don't expect the staff to speak much English. In peak hours the metro runs really full so try to keep your backpack on the front and belongings in front pockets.\n\n\n=== Dangerous areas ===\nThere are some neighborhoods/barrios that should be avoided. The few carabineros and locals that speak English will know which areas are to be avoided since some of them can actually be accessed by metro. Some people at local Starbucks are more likely to speak English.\nIf you see fewer tall buildings and more houses with locked windows and entrances, then turn back. The changes happen very slowly, unlike some other Latin American cities, so you'd have to travel quite a lot from a wealthy safe neighbourhood to a dangerous ghetto. Avoid especially La Legua (not to be confused with La Ligua in the V Regi\u00f3n) which is famed in Chile for its high crime rates. Single police cars won't even enter the area.\nTry staying away from the following comunas: Lo Espejo, La Pintana, Puente Alto (especially the Plaza de Armas), La Cisterna, San Joaqu\u00edn, El Bosque (not to be confused with the avenue and neighbourhood around Metro El Golf, which is in Las Condes), San Ram\u00f3n, Pedro Aguirre Cerda and La Granja unless you know exactly where you're going. Though these places are not completely unsafe for the most part, they can have a few unsafe spots and don't have much touristic significance.\nThe safest comunas are Providencia, Vitacura and Las Condes. All of them have lots of local security guards, besides Carabineros, and locals are more likely to speak English, especially young people. They are not completely safe, though: petty theft still takes place, so keep your eyes open in the streets. Lo Barnechea can be tricky as it is the only comuna that has both extremely wealthy and extremely poor neighbourhoods ever since Pinochet's dictatorship; \"La Dehesa\" is wealthy and safe, \"Cerro Dieciocho\" is as dangerous as La Legua.\n\n\n=== Football ===\n\nIf you are going to see a football match, be careful with the \"barras bravas\" who are the most fanatic but also dangerous fans. They are often involved in troubles with the police both inside the stadium and outside. Avoid buying tickets in the sections where the bravas dominate, which are often behind the goals. The middle section is the safest but if you have a friend who wants to support Colo-Colo and another Universidad de Chile for example, avoid showing it. Even if the middle section is safe, showing different shirts can cause you trouble. Either go with the same shirts or dress neutral. Other football matches not being the \"Supercl\u00e1sico\" between Universidad de Chile against Colo-Colo should be pretty safe.\nWalking to the stadium you will find people begging for some pesos so they can see the match. Avoid giving them if you want to stay out of trouble.\nThe barrio around the Estadio Nacional is normally peaceful, but you have to walk purposefully and keep your eyes on other people when it's crowded. It's better to take a taxi to the arena, or a rental car if you can find a place to park it.\n\n\n=== Other ===\nNever join a protest, because it can end badly. If you are caught in one, don't hesitate to hide in a restaurant, shop or something similar.\nChilean police (carabineros) are in general trustworthy, at least in comparison to other Latin American countries. Although you can hardly find one who can speak English, they will try to answer your questions, solve your problems or give you directions. Never attempt to bribe a police officer; Chile has the least corrupt police force of Latin America.\nHowever remember that the Chilean police is a militarized police. Therefore the police special forces can be violent or unreasonable if they think you have done or will do something illegal or inappropriate, so be careful.\n\n\n== Connect ==\nIf you wish to mail a letter or postcard, the largest post office is the Correo Central on the north side of Plaza de Armas, a Neoclassical building with French influences. There are several smaller post offices around the city, often close to the larger avenues.\nHowever, Chilean mail has become infamous for not getting things delivered or mailmen opening the letters trying to find money or any valuable items (mostly on mail coming from abroad).\nThe largest and most trustworthy private mail company is Chilexpress, which has agencies in almost all mid-sized cities. Prices are a bit higher, though.\n\n\n== Cope ==\n\n\n=== Embassies ===\n  Australia, Isidora Goyenechea 3621, 12F, Las Condes, \u260f +56 2 25503500, fax: +56 2 23315960, immigration.santiago@dfat.gov.au. \n  Canada, Nueva Tajamar 481 - Piso 12, Torre Norte, Edificio World Trade Center, \u260f +56 2 26523800, fax: +56 2 26523912, stago@international.gc.ca. \n  China, Pedro de Valdivia 550, Providencia, \u260f +56 2 22339880, fax: +56 2-2341129, embajadachina@entelchile.net. \n  Czech Republic, Av.

The skiing season is from May to August.\n\nSki resorts northeast of Santiago reachable by car within an hour and a half include Farellones, Valle Nevado, La Parva and El Colorado.\nThe ski resorts of Portillo and Valle Nevado are two to three hours away on the road to Mendoza.\nRancagua is 85 km to the south and has some thermal springs and hiking opportunities nearby.\nCaj\u00f3n del Maipo, beautiful in spring, some 75 km south east of Santiago, day trip. Some nice places for lunch and tea; many of them only open on weekends.\nSierras de Bellavista (150 km south of Santiago) is a wonderful little mountain village, especially after a rainy day. Alpine scenery.\nOther nearby nature reserves include Monumento Natural El Morado, Reserva Nacional R\u00edo Clarillo and Santuario de la Naturaleza Yerba Loca\nThe villages and towns in the surrounding Maipo valley is also a great place for seeing the Chilean way of life, buying handicrafts, tasting wine and savoring local cuisine.\n\n\n=== The coast ===\nThe Pacific Ocean is less than 100 km from Santiago, and easily accessible.\n\nVina del Mar, 90 minutes away is the beach capital of the country, and it also has nice parks, gardens, restaurants, cafes and casinos.\nValpara\u00edso, next to Vina del Mar is one of the largest ports on the Pacific, but certainly not a dirty industrial behemoth. It's also a famous for its world heritage listed and very Bohemian old town on the mountain sides.\nIsla Negra, a village on the coast, south of Valpara\u00edso. The main and most beloved house of Pablo Neruda is there. This is probably the most interesting of his three houses to visit and the best conserved as it is the only one that the military didn't sack during the coup d'\u00e9tat in 1973. To get there, you can take the Pullman bus (3,700 pesos, 2 hr) from Terminal Alameda (Metro Universidad de Santiago). You can also take the Turbus bus to San Antonio (1,000-2,000 pesos, 1\u00bd hr) from Alameda as well, and then take a local bus in front of \"laPolar\" (450 pesos, 30 min) that goes along the beautiful coast. Tours of the house cost 3,000 pesos and last a half an hour. Then you can go to the beach."

        "title": "Auckland",
        "extract": "Auckland (Maori: T\u0101maki Makaurau) is the largest city in New Zealand at 1.7 million citizens, and the main arrival point for visitors to the country. It is a vibrant multicultural city, set around two big natural harbours, and ranked as one of the most liveable cities in the world.  It is in the warm northern part of the North Island, on a narrow isthmus that joins the Northland peninsula to the rest of the island.\nFor information on the smaller towns, settlements and islands in the wider area around the city, see the Auckland Region article.\n\n\n== Districts ==\nUntil 2010, the Auckland urban area was divided between four city councils and three district councils. In November 2010, the councils merged into a single \"super city\" council. The districts here are based on Statistics New Zealand's four Auckland urban sub-areas, which in turn are based on the four erstwhile city councils.\n\n\n== Understand ==\n\nAuckland is New Zealand's largest city, home to 1.5 million people, nearly one-third of the country's population and more than that of the entire South Island. It is the main economic and travel hub and home to an international airport. It's lucky enough to have its own beautiful landscapes, waterways, and other attractions to draw tourists in. It is not New Zealand's political capital though \u2013 that honour goes to Wellington. Auckland is by some measures the most isolated city of over 1 million people in the world; the nearest city of over 1 million people is Sydney, 2,160 km across the sea in Australia.\nAuckland is called the \"City of Sails\" for the large number of yachts that grace the Waitemata Harbour and the Hauraki Gulf, and for the city's love of sailing.  More than 135,000 yachts and launches are registered in Auckland and several America's Cup regattas have been held here.  Auckland could also be called the \"City of Volcanoes\"; much of its natural character comes from being built on the Auckland Volcanic Field, which consists of about 50 volcanoes. All of them are individually extinct (Rangitoto was the latest to erupt, in the mid to late 15th century), but the volcanic field as a whole is not. The city also features a large number of urban beaches and parks, numerous arts and cultural institutions and events, and is home to a multitude of sporting teams.\nAuckland is frequently ranked highly in international quality-of-life polls, including third in Mercer's Quality of Living Ranking (behind Vienna and Zurich). However, Auckland is also New Zealand's most expensive city \u2013 house prices alone are double to triple those found in Wellington, Christchurch and Hamilton (the latter 130 km away).\n\nAuckland is very multicultural, with strong immigrant cultures. Some 40 percent of Auckland's population was born overseas; in two local board areas, Puketapapa (Mount Roskill) and Howick, there are more overseas-born residents than New Zealand-born ones. It has the largest Polynesian population of any city in the world. For some Polynesian island nations, there are more expatriates living in Auckland than in their homeland. There is also a large population of New Zealand's native Maori people, and populations of immigrants and expats from the UK, China, India, South Africa, South Korea and the Philippines, among others. Auckland's rich cultural mix is celebrated with a wide variety of festivals and events throughout the city.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nAuckland by definition has a temperate climate, although it is often regarded by New Zealanders as having a subtropical climate. The city experiences four distinct seasons with mild to warm summers and mild winters. Winter night temperatures rarely fall below 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F). Summers are mild to warm with average highs of 23 \u00b0C (73 \u00b0F) and lows of 17 \u00b0C (63 \u00b0F). On exceptionally hot days, the temperatures can climb to or exceed 26 \u00b0C (79 \u00b0F) and not go below 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) at night. Auckland experiences regular rainfall throughout the year, with more in winter than summer, though it can also have periods of drought. Snow in Auckland is extremely rare \u2013 the last decent snowfall in the city was in the 1930s, although snow flurries occurred in 1976 and 2011. Daylight hours run between 7:30AM and 5:15PM in the winter, and from 6AM to 8:30PM in the summer.\n\n\n=== Visitor information ===\nDiscover Auckland website\n\n\n== Get in ==\n\n\n=== By plane ===\nMain article: Auckland Airport\n\n1 Auckland Airport. (AKL IATA). New Zealand's largest airport is located 22 km/14 miles south of central Auckland in the southern suburb of Mangere on the shores of the Manukau Harbour. There are frequent services from Australia and other New Zealand cities. There are also non-stop flights from locations in Asia, the Pacific Islands, the United States, Vancouver (Canada) and Santiago (Chile). Ground transport options from the airport to central Auckland include shuttles (NZ$35) and taxis (NZ$35-65 ask for fixed fare; NZ$75-90 metered). For public transportation, you can buy a HOP card for $10 at the airport and take the AIR bus from Stop A International Terminal, get off at Puhinui Train Station, then board a train to Britomart Train Station in the CBD; the journey will take 60-90 minutes including waiting times depending on the time of the day. \n2 North Shore Aerodrome. Has a few flights from Kerikeri in the Bay of Islands, Tauranga and Great Barrier Island. \n\n\n=== By bus ===\nThe InterCity Sky City Bus Terminal at 102 Hobson St (behind Sky City Plaza) is the main hub for national coachline InterCity and its subsidiaries GreatSights. Facilities include an InterCity ticketing office, free Wi-Fi, caf\u00e9 and luggage lockers.\n\n\n=== By train ===\nMain article: Rail travel in New Zealand\nThe Northern Explorer train runs from central Wellington to 3 Auckland Strand Station on Ngaoho Place, in eastern central Auckland. The 681-km (423-mi) journey takes about 12 hours. The trip runs much of the length of the North Island with stopping-off opportunity at Tongariro National Park. In a single day you will pass every kind of scenery: coastline, volcanoes and mountains, green farm pastures and dense New Zealand bush. The train leaves Wellington on Tuesday, Friday and Sunday, and returns from Auckland on Monday, Thursday and Saturday.\nAdditionally, there are daily regional services from Hamilton with the Te Huia passenger service. The service is mainly aimed at commuters.\n\n\n=== By car ===\nAuckland is accessed from the south via State Highway 1. From Hamilton and New Plymouth you'll follow State Highway 1 north of Hamilton through northern Waikato and across the Bombay Hills into the southern suburbs of the city. From Tauranga and the Bay of Plenty, you'll follow State Highway 2 west of Tauranga to meet State Highway 1 at Pokeno, on the Waikato side of the Bombay Hills. From most other points south (including Rotorua, Napier, Palmerston North and Wellington), you will travel north to Tirau in the southern Waikato where you can choose between two routes; via Hamilton along State Highway 1, or via Matamata along State Highways 27 and 2.\nFrom Northland, you'll follow State Highway 1 to Wellsford. From there, you can continue to follow State Highway 1 to approach Auckland through the northern suburbs and over the Auckland Harbour Bridge. Alternatively, you can follow State Highway 16 to approach Auckland from the northwest via Helensville.\nApproximate distances and non-stop travel times to Auckland:\n\nWhangarei \u2013 160 km, 2 hours\nHamilton \u2013 125 km, 1.5 hours\nRotorua \u2013 230 km, 2.75 hours\nNew Plymouth \u2013 360 km, 4.5 hours\nNapier \u2013 415 km, 5 hours\nWellington \u2013 650 km, 8 hours\n\n\n=== By ship ===\n\nAuckland is a major cruise ship port of call with over 100 cruise ships a year. Auckland's main cruise terminal, Shed 10, refurbished in 2013, is located on Queens Wharf next to the central business district (CBD) and the Britomart Station.\nTo get around the CBD, look for a red CityLink bus. The CityLink bus runs along Queen Street and is only $1. The Link bus will always end up back at the place you started so you can never get lost - stay on the bus and see it all for one low flat fare. Explorer runs a hop-on, hop-off bus service. Taxis are relatively plentiful; many, such as those that serve the airport, accept credit cards.\n\n\n== Get around ==\n\nLocal transport options include bus, train, ferry, shuttle, taxi, and car rental. Use the Auckland Transport (AT) website to plan trips by public transport. AT also has a mobile app that can be used to find the time of the next bus, ferry or train or to find the quickest way to get to your destination using public transport. Google Maps is also reliable for directions. If you wish to do a lot of cross-city travel, or travel outside the city, it may be more convenient to hire a car, though some city roads are congested at peak times, and finding a parking spot can be challenging. If you don't travel too far, an electric scooter that can be hired from different companies via app might be a good and cheap alternative where you don't have to worry about the traffic jam and parking.\nBritomart Transport Centre (also known as Waitemata Station) on the corner of Queen St and Customs St in the CBD near the waterfront is the main information centre for public transport. You will find free bus, train and ferry schedules there \u2013 which is handy since the frequency of some services is low and sometimes irregular. Timetables can also be downloaded from the AT website.\nThe AT HOP card is a prepay smart card for travel on bus, train and ferry services that costs $5 and is available from a number of retrailers and major stations around the city. Cash is no longer accepted on buses and trains, but you can also use a contactless card (e.g. Visa) or a digital wallet (e.g. Google Pay) for the exact same fare as an AT Hop card. Bus and train fares use a zone-based system, with free transfers within thirty minutes - fares start at $2.80 for one zone. There is a $50 weekly fare cap on trains, buses and inner harbour ferries. No matter how you are paying, be sure to tag on and off every time, or you could be hit with a hefty fine.\n\n\n=== By bus ===\n\nBus services cover most areas of Auckland. Between 2015 and 2018, the bus network was significantly overhauled, simplifying routes and extending frequent bus services, with the trade-off of having to transfer to a train, ferry or another bus to access the CBD from the outer suburbs. Routes with two-digit numbers run at least every 15 minutes daily between 7AM and 7PM; routes with three-digit numbers operate on lower frequencies. Buses no longer accept cash - an AT HOP card is required.\nThe most useful bus routes for visitors are as follows:\n\nThe City Link bus runs in a circuit from Karangahape Rd/Upper Queen St to Britomart or the Wynyard Quarter \u2013 it costs 64c with HOP (as of October 2023).\nThe Inner Link is a loop service connecting CBD and the surrounding areas of Newmarket, Parnell and Ponsonby. It is fairly frequent and costs up to $2.37 with HOP card, if you stay in one zone.\nThe Outer Link is a service that runs from Newmarket, past the Museum and Parnell, then to the Universities, through Westmere, Herne Bay, out to the Meola Rd entrance to MOTAT, and terminates at St Lukes. The buses are bright amber and operate on a frequent basis, so no timetables are required.\nNorthern Express (NX1 and NX2) buses run between the central city and the North Shore along the Northern Busway, a bus rapid transit (BRT) line. NX1 services start at Lower Albert St near Britomart and terminate at Hibiscus Coast busway station. NX2 services start in Wellesley St between the universities and terminate at Albany busway station. They run every 3 to 10 minutes during working hours and no more than 15 minutes apart in the evenings and weekends. Last services leave between 11PM and midnight, with some NX1 services after midnight on Friday and Saturday nights (but only to/from Albany, not Hibiscus Coast).\nThe T\u0101maki Link runs every 15 minutes between Britomart, Mission Bay, St Heliers and Glen Innes train station via Tamaki Drive, passing by Kelly Tarlton's.\nRoute 18 provides a service every 12 minutes between Victoria St in the CBD and New Lynn train station, via Great North Rd, passing close to the Zoo and MOTAT.\n\n\n=== By train ===\n\nTravel by urban train is a good option, but only if you are near a train line; there are few lines and not all suburbs are served. Rail in Auckland has had a renaissance since the turn of the millennium, especially after the central city terminus moved to Britomart in 2003. During 2014 and 2015 new electric trains  replaced diesel trains, except between Papakura and Pukekohe in the south, where diesels still run.\nAn AT HOP card provides tag-on/tag-off travel.\nThe four main lines are the Southern, Onehunga, Eastern and Western lines. The Southern Line runs from Britomart station in the CBD, roughly parallel to the Southern Motorway, to Papakura, with some services continuing on to Pukekohe. The Onehunga Line follows the Southern Line as far as Penrose, before diverting southwest to Onehunga. The Eastern Line runs from Britomart through the east of central Auckland to Manukau Central, sharing with the Southern Line between Westfield and Puhinui. The Western Line runs from Britomart westward to Swanson station. There are no train services on the North Shore or in the suburbs east of the Tamaki River, although the Northern Express bus (see By bus above) from Britomart to Albany provides rapid transit service to the rail-less North Shore.\nThe Southern and Eastern lines have the most frequent and reliable services. Trains run every 10 minutes on-peak, 20 minutes off-peak and 30 minutes on evenings and weekends (except for the Onehunga line which runs every 30 minutes all day.). Approximately 85-95% of these services run on time. \n\n\n=== By car ===\nThe road network experiences severe congestion at rush hour.  Geography constrains the network to a limited number of routes. Auckland has a comprehensive road network for a city its size, but lack of investment in public transport and geographic sprawl means it is largely dependent on private cars.\nIt is often easier and cheaper to hire a car instead of using taxis, simply because the city is so large and spread out. Auckland city is well covered by the main global car rental companies, such as Avis, Budget, Hertz, Thrifty and Europcar. All car rental companies offer competitive pricing for economy class vehicles and unlimited mileage options. Local car rental companies like Apex and Jucy may also offer competitive pricing.\nThere are three main motorway systems running through Auckland. The Northern Motorway (from north of Orewa to the Central Motorway Junction (CMJ) a.k.a. Spaghetti Junction) \u2013 note that it has a toll for the last few kilometres beyond Silverdale. The Southern Motorway runs from the CMJ past the Bombay Hills where it splits into State Highway 2 (SH2), and merges to the Waikato Expressway. The Northwestern Motorway runs from Auckland Port through CMJ to near Kumeu. These motorways clog up during the morning rush in the CBD-bound direction, and in the opposite direction during the evening rush. The Harbour Bridge has a method of mitigating this traffic load \u2013 it changes the lane system from 4-4 to 5-3, favouring the side which has the heavier traffic load. So be careful when crossing the bridge \u2013 some lanes will be available for you at one time but not another.\nWatch heading southbound over the Harbour Bridge \u2013 if you are heading to the Southern Motorway (e.g. to South Auckland or the Airport), make sure you are in at least lane 3 (if not lane 4) before you reach the bridge to ensure you go over on the main bridge and not the clip-on lanes. Otherwise you will have only a few hundred metres after the bridge to cross two lanes of traffic to lane 4 before lane 1, 2 and 3 split off towards the city centre and the Northwestern Motorway.\n\nSome motorway on-ramps have traffic lights operating in busy periods \u2013 they allow one or two cars to proceed every three to eight seconds to ease the merging onto the motorway. Cameras may be operating to catch red-light runners.\n\n\n=== By taxi ===\nTaxi fares vary considerably from company to company. For example, see the Get in: By plane section for an indication of fares from the airport to Britomart.\nThe Uber ride-sharing service is available in most of Auckland.\n\n\n=== By ferry ===\nFerry services operate from the CBD to other points on the mainland and to Hauraki Gulf islands.\n\n\n== See ==\n\nAuckland's many volcanoes offer great vantage points to take in the city and some of them have been turned into parks. Popular ones include Mt. Eden and One Tree Hill in Auckland Central and Mt. Victoria in Devonport.\n\nAuckland Art Gallery, cnr Kitchener and Wellesley Streets. The largest collection of national and international art in New Zealand, housed in an award-winning landmark building on the edge of Albert Park in the heart of Auckland. The Gallery regularly hosts touring international exhibitions and offers a calendar of talks, performances, film screenings and children's activities to complement its exhibition programme. Has a shop and caf\u00e9. Free entry to permanent exhibitions for locals (excluding special exhibitions), $20 for international visitors\nAuckland Domain is Auckland's oldest park and hosts weekend sports events. Includes the historically important winter gardens with impressive flower bed displays, tropical plants and statues (free). There are scenic views of the Waitemata Harbour and islands of the Hauraki Gulf from in front of the museum.\n\nAuckland War Memorial Museum, Parnell. The museum displays collections of significant importance at its prominent position in Auckland Domain.  It was constructed in the 1920s as a war memorial to those that fought and died in theatres of war.  The cenotaph located on the grounds below the steps leading up to the museum entrance is the focal point for annual ANZAC day remembrance services.  The top floor records names in stone as well as sobering tombs and lists of war events and their locations.  The museum contains excellent exhibitions of M\u0101ori and other Polynesian peoples' arts and crafts and daily M\u0101ori cultural performances as well as geography of the Auckland region. There is a planetarium and a cafe. $25 entry for overseas visitors, donation invited from NZ residents, free for Auckland residents.\nAuckland Zoo, Motions Rd, Western Springs. Auckland Zoo is home to the largest collection of native and exotic animals in New Zealand, set in 17 hectares of lush parkland and just minutes from central Auckland.\n\nKelly Tarlton's Sea Life Aquarium on the scenic Tamaki Drive includes the Antarctic Encounter and Underwater World. It's an aquarium that includes a trip through a transparent tunnel while the fish and sharks swim all around you, and tanks of rays with feeding-time talks.\nMOTAT (Museum of Transport and Technology), Great North Rd, Western Springs.  Situated near the Zoo in Western Springs. It's an interactive museum with over 300,000 items. Look out for the WW 2 Avro Lancaster Bomber and the Solent Flying Boat in the Sir Keith Park Memorial Aviation Collection.\nNew Zealand National Maritime Museum, cnr Quay and Hobson St, Viaduct Harbour. Interesting exhibits chronicle New Zealand's maritime history. Free entry for Aucklanders, $20 for other visitors.\n\nSky Tower, cnr Victoria and Federal St. At 328 m, this is the tallest free-standing tower in the Southern Hemisphere, offering views of up to 80 km away and fine dining in the Orbit revolving restaurant.\nThe StarDome Observatory on the slopes of One Tree Hill. The park also contains M\u0101ori archaeological sites, a kid's playgrounds, two cafes and a working farm.\n\n\n== Do ==\nMovies. Ticket prices vary around Auckland. The cheapest are in the west, with adult tickets at WestCity in Henderson the lowest at $8.50, and a bit higher at $10 at LynnMall and Westgate. Hoyts Hibiscus Coast in the north on Whangaparaoa Peninsula is also cheap at $10.90. Elsewhere in Auckland prices are in the $18.50 to $19.50 range, except on Tuesdays when there is a $12.50 special (2017 prices).\nVisit the Waitakere Ranges in West Auckland, replete with impressive waterfalls and rugged but beautiful beaches. Around 45 min (peak hours) drive from central Auckland.\nEden Park in Central Auckland is the national stadium, hosting rugby union and cricket.\nGolf: notable courses are Gulf Harbour, and Formosa at Beachlands.\n\n\n=== Beaches ===\nThere are many beaches, due to Auckland's straddling of two harbours. The most popular ones are in three areas:\n\nNorth Shore beaches (in North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south. They are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming, and most have shade provided by pohutukawa trees. Most are accessible by bus. Takapuna Beach is the most centrally located, with a lovely beach-front caf\u00e9 at one end. Just north of Long Bay is a family nudist beach. St Leonard's Beach is gay male nudist. Others are conventional.\nTamaki Drive beaches are on the Waitemata Harbour, in the upmarket suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland. These are sometimes-crowded family beaches with a good range of shops lining the shore. Swimming is safe. Mission Bay beach is Auckland's equivalent of Los Angeles' Santa Monica/Venice Beach and is extremely popular on a hot summer's day. To its east, Kohimarama and St Heliers beaches are usually less crowded. Ladies Bay to the east of St Heliers has historically been a nudist-friendly beach, but is frequented by regular beachgoers too, and is accessible by a 5 min walk down from the cliff-top road.\n\nWest coast beaches are on the Tasman Sea, and have large expanses of sand and rolling surf. They have unpredictable rips so you should swim only between the lifeguards' flags, which cover select areas of the most popular beaches. They are about a 40-min drive from the city centre (via West Auckland) and the roads are narrow and winding. You'll need your own transport. There's little shade available, and few shops. The sand on these beaches is dark in colour due to high iron content from its volcanic origins. There are several smaller beaches accessible only by foot. The major beaches from south to north are:\nWhatipu is the southernmost beach, and the most isolated. The last 7 km of the road there is unsealed, but in good condition. There's a track from the carpark to the beach conservatively signposted as 15-min walk. There are several volcanic outcrops surrounding the beach, and native vegetation including cabbage trees along the path. Manukau Harbour is just to the south of the beach, separated by Paratutae Island. Paratutae is joined to the beach except at high tide. There are caves signposted 20-min walk from the car park; the track is muddy during winter. The caves are less spectacular than they once were because they've partially filled up with sand. No dogs are permitted.\nKarekare is the next beach north of Whatipu. It's considerably more popular and there are lifeguards patrolling the beach during summer. Karekare Falls is a waterfall not far from the road.\nPiha is the best known and most popular beach. It has lifeguards during summer. The most notable feature is Lion Rock, which separates the northern and southern sides of the beach. There's a steep track partway up Lion Rock to get decent views. Kitekite Falls are a small and pleasant waterfall near the beach. Laird Thomson Track is a walkway from North Piha to the isolated Whites Beach, which usually has very few people on it.\nAnawhata has no road access to the beach, but there's a fairly steep track down from an unsealed road. This is the least used beach and you may be the only people there at any given time.\nTe Henga (Bethells Beach) is accessible by road, and has lifeguards in the summer. Erangi Point separates it from unpatrolled O'Neill Bay to the north, which can only be reached by foot.\nMuriwai is the second most popular of the west coast beaches. There's a colony of gannets (seabirds) which nest in huge numbers and are worth seeing year round. Muriwai has a caf\u00e9, a golf course, and lifeguards during summer.\n\n\n== Buy ==\nThe downtown area of the CBD has a number of souvenir shops for a range of budgets. Check around the lower Queen Street and lower Albert Street area.\nHobson Street (at the top end) has a couple of large shops also stocking honey and health products.\nThe High Street/Vulcan Lane/O'Connell Street area is the Fashion centre of Auckland Central and has local designer stores as well as international brands\nThere are a number of markets in Auckland; perhaps the most famous for Aucklanders are the Otara and Avondale markets (serving South and West Auckland respectively).\n\n\n== Eat ==\nThere are some good cheap food courts (food halls) offering a variety of usually Asian foods usually priced around $10.  Try next to the Queens' Arcade at the bottom of Queen St (slightly hidden entrance), or the Metro award winning Food Alley (9-11 Albert St).  Very good value and good quality predominantly non-Asian choices are available at Elliott Stables (39 Elliott Street, near Wellesley). Also on the same block is the Atrium on Elliott (21 Elliott Street), a good quality food court of predominantly Asian food. Check out the once-a-week night markets at various locations on different nights.\nBritomart Precinct on the waterfront in the city centre is home to an array of popular and diverse bars and eateries.  Cafe Hanoi, Ebisu, Britomart Country Club, Mexico  Giapo ice cream, to name a few.  A must visit.\nViaduct Harbour provides upmarket dining, starting at $30 for mains. While this area has some very nice bars and restaurants, be wary of restaurants lacking customers and usually very quiet. It may be a sign of below average food or poor service.\n\n\n== Drink ==\n\nYou can find neighbourhood pubs in many parts of the city, but the highest concentration of bars and clubs is in Auckland Central \u2014 particularly around the Viaduct area, K Road, Ponsonby and Parnell.\n\n\n== Learn ==\nAuckland is home to the University of Auckland, which is the top ranked university in New Zealand, and is consistently ranked among the top 100 in the world by several ranking agencies.\n\n\n== Work ==\nDue to already high migration and stresses on local infrastructure in Auckland, the New Zealand immigration service makes it harder to obtain a work visa for those migrants wishing to work in Auckland. Australian citizens and permanent residents can live and work in New Zealand indefinitely.\n\n\n== Sleep ==\nAccommodation can be found throughout the city, but the largest selection is in Central Auckland particularly the central business district.\nBackpackers hostels are predominantly found in the central business district although there are a few in other areas. These are usually intended for young adults coming from overseas but there are few, if any restrictions on who can stay. Beds in shared dorms will cost around $40-$60 per night, female only dorms are also commonly offered. Often, they will also offer private rooms for a premium but these will be more competitively priced than a hotel room in a similar area. They will usually have a shared kitchen, and various other shared facilities such as games and TV rooms but this will vary from hostel to hostel.\nMotel style accommodation is found across the city, they will almost always have car parking available and a reasonably well equipped kitchenette in each room. These are often less expensive than hotels of similar quality and provide the ability to self-cater. They may have shared facilities such as games and tv rooms or occasionally pools or spas.\nTraditional hotels are found mainly in the CBD although there may be others in areas with a high density of offices to cater to people on work trips. These are often the most expensive type of accommodation. Quality can vary from just adequate to luxury.\nAirbnb can offer a range of accommodation to suit any size group and budget and often has locations outside of traditional accommodation spots. Hosts are usually welcoming and friendly, although they may prefer to \"leave a key\" and not interact face to face. \n\n\n== Stay safe ==\nAuckland is a safe place to visit, thanks to a quality of life that ranks alongside cities like Munich or Melbourne. That said, thefts and robberies are more prevalent than in the rest of New Zealand, and aggravated assaults are not unheard of. Make sure to take all the usual safety precautions. Asking locals can give you an idea of where not to go.\nThe area locals will most definitely warn you about is South Auckland, which is widely regarded as one of New Zealand's most dangerous locations due to its significant poverty and unemployment rates. While it is nowhere nearly as dangerous as \"rough\" areas in the USA or Europe, it is advised to remain on one's guard at night. People might also advise against going to certain parts of West Auckland, a former working-class area seen as \"rough around the edges\" that has thankfully improved markedly over the years, but still suffers from occasional burglaries and thefts.\nAs in the rest of the country, alcohol culture is very prevalent in Auckland, and it is not abnormal to see drunkards of all ages and from all walks of life meander around.\nDrugs are also becoming a major issue in Auckland, with junkies becoming an unfortunately common sight along Karangahape Road (commonly known as K' Road) and parts of Queen Street at night. Simply avoiding eye-contact will be enough to avoid trouble.\n\n\n== Connect ==\nFree internet is available from the public library (limited 1GB per IP address per day). There is also free Wi-Fi in the Skycity food courts. There are 40 HotSpots that offer Wi-Fi connectivity, most notably Esquires cafe (inside Skycity Queen St, Middle Queen St, Lower Queen St, Nelson St), Starbucks (Victoria St, K' Rd, Lower Queen St) and other cafes around Auckland.\n\n\n== Cope ==\n\n\n=== Consulates ===\n  Australia, Level 7 PriceWaterHouseCoopers Tower 186-194 Quay Street, \u260f +64 9-921 8800, fax: +64 9 9218820, consular.auckland@dfat.gov.au.

It's home to an abundance of art galleries, some fantastic wines and has some of the best beaches in the area. You can rent a scooter and get around the island fairly quickly. Can get crowded during the weekends, but very quiet during the week. It seems a world away from Auckland, but is only 35 minutes by ferry.\nTake a ferry to Rangitoto Island. Rangitoto Island has trails around much of the island, as well as a bridge that connects to the neighboring Motutapu Island, and is a great hike for even the most inexperienced hikers. Rangitoto Island has several lava caves that can be crawled or climbed through as well a spectacular 360 degree view at the summit (only about an hour hike on the most direct trail). This is one of the more convenient islands that is nearby as it is only 20-25 minutes by ferry.\nRotorua, Hamilton, Waitomo Caves and Taupo are all within several hours drive and all have a lot to offer."

        "title": "Gold Coast",
        "extract": "The Gold Coast is a large city along the coast in the southeast corner of the state of Queensland in Australia. The year-round warm weather, theme parks and many beaches just south of Brisbane have made it a popular destination with travellers. Surfers Paradise forms the glitzy hub of tourist activity. Each year thousands of Australian students complete their secondary education by indulging in Schoolies Week by travelling to the Gold Coast for a week of partying. \n\n\n== Districts ==\n\nOther districts include:\n\nMermaid Beach and Miami - Largely low-rise residential suburbs with motels and restaurants along the highway.\nPalm Beach - Largely residential area.\n\n\n== Understand ==\nThe Gold Coast is a large urban area with a population of 720,000, the largest non-state capital in Australia. \nMost visitors will the Gold Coast as a long thin strip of modern high-rise buildings next to seemingly endless beaches, although the city itself extends far inland to the hills of the Scenic Rim. Surfers Paradise, towards the northern end, is the main hub of the leisure activity. There is a huge choice of hotels, restaurants, tourist shops and tourist experiences to be found. The city is developing itself as a work-hub for large corporations that want to offer their employees a better work-life balance away from the capital cities. The city shares its infrastructure, facilities, services and labour market with Brisbane to the north. Workers commonly commute between the two by rail and road.\n\n\n=== History ===\nLieutenant James Cook became the first European to chart the region when he sailed along the coast on 16 May 1770. Captain Matthew Flinders, an explorer charting continent north of the colony of New South Wales sailed past in 1802. Escaped convicts from Moreton Bay penal settlement hid in the region. The region remained uninhabited when John Oxley landed at Mermaid Beach, which was named after a cutter named Mermaid.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nThe climate of the Gold Coast ensures that travellers are able to enjoy the area year round. It has a mild, sub-tropical climate. The winter months tend to have little rainfall with average highs of 21 \u00b0C (70 \u00b0F), while the summer has frequent storms originating from the west. Summer temperatures average just below 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) for daytime highs and average around 22 \u00b0C (72 \u00b0F) for overnight lows. Given the humid climate, an exceptionally hot day with a temperature of 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) can feel like 34 \u00b0C (93 \u00b0F); such sweltering days can have overnight lows remain near 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F) throughout the night. Daylight hours run from 6:35AM to just before 5PM in the winter months. During the summer, sunrise is as early as 4:40AM, and sunset is around 6:45PM.\nPredictions of rain often equate to brief and intense afternoon storms, rather than extended periods of gentle rain.\n\n\n=== Geography ===\nThe Gold Coast, that visitors are more familiar with, stretches along the coastal suburbs from Paradise Point to Tweed Heads (about 35 km).\n\n\n=== Tourist information ===\nDestination Gold Coast website\n\n\n== Get in ==\n\n\n=== By plane ===\n\nGold Coast Airport (OOL IATA) is widely known as Coolangatta Airport, even though it is in Bilinga. It may be unique in the world in that, because it straddles the NSW and Queensland borders, you land in one state and arrive in another. It is a fairly small terminal but handles around 3.5 million passengers per year with frequent connections from major Australian cities and some international flights from New Zealand and Asia. It is not a 24-hour airport and closes at night, so don't plan on spending the night before an early morning flight. It is around 30 minutes drive to Surfers Paradise.\nThe 777 bus runs every 15 minutes connecting the airport to the southernmost tram station at Broadbeach South, from where you can easily transfer to Surfers Paradise.\nPublic transport from Gold Coast Airport to Brisbane City: Take bus 470 to Varsity Lakes railway station and transfer to the Gold Coast line. The bus picks up and drops off passengers inside the terminal complex. Total travel time is about two hours.\nAirport Transfers (shuttles) operate 'door to door' between the airport and accommodation along the coast and are a popular alternative to taxis ($21 per person).\nBrisbane Airport (BNE IATA) is used by many overseas visitors because it is larger, served by more international air carriers, and has direct air flights to many Australian cities. However, the transport to the airport is more tedious and inconvenient. Options include:\n\nRental car, 80 minute drive along the Gateway and Pacific Motorway but the most viable option.\nDirect Airport Transfer, about 1hr 40 min, can drop off at accommodation, fares from $40 to $50.\nTrain with car transfer package\nTrain with connecting local bus at Nerang or Robina\nTrain with connecting local tram at Helensvale\n\n\n==== Flights ====\nDomestic\nMajor domestic carriers include Virgin Australia, Jetstar, and Qantas. \nThere are regional Queensland flights to make many cities and towns.\n\nAirnorth, Jetstar, Qantas, QantasLink, Virgin Australia\nInternational \n\nAir Asia X from Kuala Lumpur\nAir New Zealand from Auckland and Christchurch\nJetstar from Auckland, Queenstown, Seoul Incheon International Airport, Tokyo Narita International Airport, Wellington\n\n\n=== By train ===\nQueensland Rail runs a train service from Brisbane to Coomera, Helensvale, Nerang and Robina. Trains run half-hourly 06:00-23:59 daily taking just over an hour from Brisbane Central to Helensvale, Nerang and Robina. The trains can get crowded at peak times, but it's unusual to have to stand. The tram connects to Southport, Surfers Paradise and Broadbeach at Helensvale.  Buses connect Nerang and Robina to Surfers Paradise, Coolangatta, and into northern New South Wales.\nNSW Trainlink in NSW runs trains from Sydney with bus connections at Casino for services direct to Surfers Paradise or Tweed Heads. However, this is a slow (11\u00bd hr) and expensive service. Set aside a whole day for the trip.\n\n\n== Get around ==\n\n\n=== By public transport ===\nTranslink is responsible for all trains, buses, ferries and trams in South East Queensland and regional urban buses. The website and app can be used to plan a journey, including full navigation and real time updates. Apple Maps and Google Maps provide a similar experience.\n\n\n==== Fares ====\nA 50-cent flat fare applies to any journey, regardless of mode, distance or transfers. The only exception is an Airtrain journey to or from Brisbane Airport which costs $22.30. Refer to the website for discounted fares. You can be fined $261 for travelling without a valid fare.\nThere are three ways to pay for your journey:\n\nContactless credit or debit card. A Visa, Mastercard or American Express is accepted, including those in a digital wallet like Apple Pay or Google Pay. Your fare is deducted from your card as you touch on and touch off each mode of transport. Trains and trams have fare gates or distinctive pink validators to touch before you board and after you alight. Buses and ferries have validators to touch as you board and alight. A failure to touch off each mode of transport will result in a fixed fare of $2.50.\nGo card. A go card is available at train station ticket counters, busway and tram fare machines, and selected newsagents and convenience stores. The card requires a $10 deposit. The card can be topped up with travel credit at the same locations, including train station fare machines. The maximum travel credit you can top up is $250. Refunding the deposit and travel credit can be a hassle. If you last topped up using cash it can be processed at Brisbane Airport and selected newsagents and convenience stores. If you last topped up using credit or debit card it can only be processed via an Australian bank account transfer.\nPaper ticket. A paper ticket is available at train station ticket counters and fare machines, and busway and tram fare machines.\n\n\n==== By train ====\nInterurban services run between Brisbane and the Gold Coast, with connecting tram services at Helensvale.\n\n\n==== By tram ====\n\nG:Link (Gold Coast Light Rail) provides the main form of public transport along the Gold Coast. The route travels from Helensvale Station via Gold Coast University Hospital and Surfers Paradise to Broadbeach South. The trams run from 5AM till midnight on weekdays and 24 hours on weekends running every 15 minutes or less in the hours of 5AM till midnight.\nAn extension to Burleigh Heads is under construction and is expected to be in operation by 2025.\nA further extension to the NSW border via Gold Coast Airport is planned to open before the 2032 Olympics.\n\n\n==== By bus ====\nSurfside Buslines provides the supplementary form of public transport along the Gold Coast with stops located on most main roads. Buses run 24 hours a day, but are more frequent in the daytime. All the main tourist attractions are serviced by bus. The frequency of services up and down the coast along the beach between Coolangatta and Surfers Paradise is very good at least every half hour. For other routes, and theme parks, it is best to check the timetable in advance.\n\n\n=== By taxi ===\nExpect to wait up to an hour or more for a taxi on busy nights:Taxi services. A taxi fare between the Gold Coast Airport at Coolangatta and Surfers Paradise costs around $55 and a sedan limousine is about the same. Stretch limousines are another option for groups of more than four with a cost of $100-110.\n\n\n=== By car ===\nAll attractions around the Gold Coast are accessible by car, and there are large car parks at the theme parks and other attractions. Parking meters are found in the busiest streets of Surfers Paradise, Southport and Burleigh Heads, but free parking can be found a few street blocks away. There are paid parking areas in Surfers Paradise and Southport operated by shopping centres and the city council that charge about $1 per hour, the largest is the Bruce Bishop Car Park adjacent to the transit centre.\nThe Gold Coast doesn't suffer from the same congestion as Brisbane, largely because it has several business centres. The morning peak hour is 07:00-08.30, while the afternoon peak is 15:30-17:00. Roads to avoid at these times include Bundall Road, Southport-Nerang Road, The Gold Coast Hwy at Surfers Paradise and the Pacific Motorway between Nerang and Palm Beach.\nMost car rental dealers are in the main business district of the suburb, between the Gold Coast Highway and Surfers Paradise Boulevard. Most major car rental companies allow you to hire cars for a one way trip. There are also local car rental companies such as Costless Car Rental, Brian's Auto Centre & East Coast Car Rentals, which may also offer competitive pricing.\nWhile most car rental companies hire to people 25 years of age and over, some all-age car rental companies do hire to younger drivers over 18 years of age with an additional surcharge. To avoid delays, check with your car rental provider beforehand if you are under 25.\n\n\n=== By bike ===\nThe Gold Coast Oceanway is a 36-km pathway for pedestrians and cyclists linking Point Danger to the Gold Coast Seaway, stretching along most of the city coastline.  It can be a little crowded with pedestrians in parts.\n\n\n== See ==\n\n\n=== Ocean (or surf) beaches ===\n\nThere are over 52 km of ocean beaches maintained by the local council. In addition to this there are (largely un-patrolled) ocean beaches in the Tweed Shire of Northern NSW and numerous waterway beaches.\nList of beaches (north to south):\n\n\n=== Other (calm water) beaches ===\nThe Gold Coast also has numerous beaches in calmer, more protected water away from the surf, ideal for families with small children.\n\n\n=== Gold Coast Hinterland ===\nPromoted as \"the green behind the gold\", the Gold Coast Hinterland refers to the mountainous area between the Gold Coast and the Scenic Rim region. It is home to national parks, mountain resorts, waterfalls, reservoirs, scenic drives and lookouts, wineries, and rock formations. The area is mostly covered in subtropical rainforest, but sections have been cleared for dairy farmland and wineries. The Hinterland is best seen by car or on a bus tour as the roads wind through the mountains with various lookout points along the way and towering trees lining the roads. It is truly a beautiful drive.\n\nTamborine Mountain featuring:\nNumerous lookouts offering panoramic views in all directions\nA great cottage industry with fantastic restaurants, fudge shops, and wineries - many of which offer free samples!\nSpringbrook Mountain\nHinze Dam and Advancetown Lake\nLamington National Park\nNuminbah Valley featuring the Natural Bridge rockpool and waterfall (see glow worms at night).\nTallebudgera Valley\nCurrumbin Valley\nMany tours operate in the hinterland area. Some are more of a bus tour as opposed to an all inclusive day. Watch the small print and enjoy. 4WD tour companies generally offer all inclusive tours to the hinterland area.\n\n\n== Do ==\nThe Gold Coast region is big on theme parks. During peak season expect them all to be quite busy. Before you go, investigate ticket discounts for combined travel and entry, multi-park and multi-day passes. Members of  Australian motoring associations can purchase discounted tickets from them before you travel.\nA short list of attractions and admission prices:\n\nCurrumbin Wildlife Sanctuary: koalas, kangaroos, birds, snakes, crocodiles. Admission $40-50.\nSea World: Marine park with rides, sharks, dolphins, penguins, polar bears. Admission $50-80.\nWarner Bros. Movie World: Movie-themed rides and photo opportunities with famous characters like Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck. Admission $50-80.\nDreamworld: Amusement park, rides, themed lands and animals. Admission $50-80.\nWhiteWater World: Water park with pools, slides. Admission $30-50.\nAustralian Outback Spectacular: horses and unique Australian lifestyle (dinner provided). Admission $55-110. Next to Movie World.\nWet'n'Wild: Water park with pools, slides, rides. Admission $35-60.\nTropical Fruit World: Fruit plantation orchard, with tour, shows, tasting. Admission Adults $44, Children $25 (ages 4-16), Concession $35, Family Pass $110 (2A+2C) or $120 (2A+3C).\nWarner Bros. Movie World, Sea World and Wet'n'Wild are owned by the same company, so check out one of their combo tickets if you're planning on hitting two or more of them.\nDreamworld and WhiteWater World offer the same kind of deal.\n\n\n=== Be wary ===\nBe wary of street vendors promising free tickets to theme parks. Generally found along Cavill Mall in Surfers Paradise, they promise free theme park tickets in return for 3-4 hours of your time watching a timeshare presentation followed by high pressure salesmanship to sign up.\nMany legitimate vendors sell discounted theme park tickets. Check out the tourist information booths run by Gold Coast Tourism Corporation.\n\n\n== Buy ==\nCavill Mall and surrounds have some cheap souvenir and t-shirt shops. There are dozens of stores around Surfers Paradise catering exclusively for the tourist market and Australian opals, sheepskins, wool products, and Aboriginal \"artifacts\".  Watch out for overpriced goods.  Local newspapers regularly run stories about \"discount warehouses\" being taken to court for selling souvenirs at exorbitant prices to Asian tourists on organized tours.\nSurfers Paradise has several shopping centres including the Centro Shopping Plaza (with Woolworths supermarket and numerous souvenir shops) and the Chevron Renaissance Shopping Centre (with Coles Supermarkets and fashion shops). Although these cater for most tourist needs, better value for everyday items can generally be found outside Surfers Paradise.\n\n\n== Eat ==\n\nThe back arcades of Surfers Paradise have dozens of cheap Japanese and Korean \"lunchbox\" style restaurants and the quality is usually excellent, not to mention the price (less than $15 for a large main meal).\nA variety of quick eats is available in the mall off Cavill Avenue. A highlight for vegetarians is Govinda's Veg-O-Rama in the mall. There is a very well priced sushi train one street north of Cavill Ave called Sushi in Paradise (2 Elkhorn Ave.)\nTedder Avenue in Main Beach and the Broadbeach area have the largest concentration of restaurants and caf\u00e9s with food ranging from gourmet seafood to pub fare. Expect to pay $20\u201350 for a main meal. At most of the restaurants, you can bring your own alcohol.\nThere is an all you can eat Buffet in Jupiters Casino that offers lunch for $29.90, dinner for $40 (seafood on F Sa for $50). The food there is delicious and there are plenty of entrees, mains, roasts and desserts.\nHeading north to the Marina's around the Broadwater will put you right amongst the Gold Coast's freshest fish markets. Peter's Fish Market is just north of Marina Mirage and will happily cook fish and chips if you have nowhere to do it yourself.\nIf there is a local speciality it has to be Mud Crabs, known as muddies, which are great when in season.\nIf you are in Broadbeach, the Kurrawa Surf Club has heaps of options, plus for the vegetarians there is a falafel burger. It is right in front of the beach and the view is sublime.\nGood Food Gold Coast is an independent food and restaurant review website which will help you choose a place to eat.\n\n\n== Drink ==\nTry a local surf club for a cheap beer with a great view, you'll find one or two in every beachside suburb of the Gold Coast. They're generally right in front of the beach their members patrol and serve deliciously affordable food and drinks. The fish doesn't actually get much fresher. Broadbeach and Surfers Paradise offer the biggest choice of bars, clubs, and cafes, and you can order almost anything you can dream up.\nFurther south, Kirra Surf Lifesaving Club, Coolangatta Surf Lifesaving Club, Tweed Heads & Coolangatta Surf Lifesaving Club and Rainbow Bay Surf Lifesaving Club have spectacular decks, good food and entertainment and friendly welcomes.  Just sign in as a guest.\nTwin Towns RSL is the largest RSL in NSW.  On the border of Queensland and NSW it offers a variety of dining options, frequent entertainment acts, and a friendly environment all at club prices.  It has the sterile renovated feel of many of the newer clubs, but it is possible to get a seat with nice view.\n\n\n== Sleep ==\nBackpacker hostels are mostly located in Surfers Paradise, Southport, Main Beach and Coolangatta with dorm beds starting at around $20 a night.\nMotels are located all along the Gold Coast Hwy. Most can be found in Labrador, Mermaid Beach, Miami, Palm Beach and Tweed Heads. Single rooms are $60-80, while doubles rooms are $70-90 but prices increase during peak summer. Prices are lower and availability is better, the further they are away from Surfers Paradise.\nCamping and caravan grounds are dotted about the Gold Coast, although many have closed to make way for other development. The largest operator is Gold Coast Tourist Parks, a business arm of the Gold Coast City Council. It has 7 parks: Main Beach, Tallebudgera Creek, Burleigh Heads, Kirra Beach, Broadwater, Jacobs Well, Ocean Beach (Miami). Other caravan parks can be found in Ashmore, Miami, Carrara, Labrador, Nerang and Mudgeeraba. Accommodation options include caravan and camping sites, luxury cabins and group lodgings. Facilities may include swimming pools, play equipment and barbecue areas.\nApartment accommodation in high- and low-rise buildings. A two-bedroom apartment in Surfers Paradise will cost around $150 per night in the off-season, and upwards of $300 a night in peak summer. Many have a minimum stay of 3 or 5 nights and may allow only one Saturday night per seven days (also one Tuesday). Reception hours are limited and a bond may be required in some cases. Inside amenities typically include kitchen, washer and dryer, and separate bedrooms. Outside amenities may include swimming pool, gym and other resort facilities.\nHotels include chains such as the Marriott and Crowne Plaza. Hotels are concentrated in Surfers Paradise and Broadbeach.\n\n\n== Connect ==\n\n\n=== Wireless Internet ===\nMany accommodation operators offer free Wi-Fi access to their guests.\nOther Wi-Fi hotspots include McDonalds and Hungry Jacks restaurants and coffee shops such as Starbucks and Gloria Jeans. Free Wi-Fi is also available in all Gold Coast City Branch libraries, except Mudgeeraba and the mobile library.\n\n\n== Stay safe ==\n\n\n=== Swimming ===\nAlmost all beaches between the Gold Coast Seaway and Coolangatta are patrolled by volunteer and professional lifesavers. The patrolled areas are marked by red and yellow flags.  Signs on the beaches will show you the closest patrolled beaches at any particular time of year.\nAlways swim between the flags. The flags have been lined up with the safest parts of the beach and are patrolled by lifesavers. If you do get into trouble or feel yourself being pulled out of your depth by a \"rip\", don't try to swim against the water. Swim parallel to the beach and raise your hand to attract the attention of a lifesaver. Always check the lifeguard chalk board near the (usually) yellow flag for up to date swimming conditions, water temperature, tide times and other information.\nSwimming is also not recommended:\n\nAfter heavy rain when water quality and clarity become poor. Debris and other aquatic organisms are in the water and sometimes an algae or seaweed bloom occurs for a few days afterwards.\nWhen jellyfish (or stingers) are present. They usually appear in the summer months brought in by northerly winds in the afternoon.\nIf schools of small fish are present, as these may attract sharks. If a shark has been spotted, lifeguards will direct people to get out of the water quickly.\nDuring choppy or unstable surf conditions, check the lifeguard chalk board.\nIn canals, due to bull sharks and jet skis.\nDogs are permitted on beaches provided except within 200 m of flagged areas, part of Gold Coast City Dog Exercise Areas.\nSurfers must not surf in the zone between the flags.\nThe Gold Coast Oceanway, which is a 36-km network of pathways along beaches from the Gold Coast Seaway (The Spit) to the Point Danger Lighthouse (Coolangatta), is a great way to walk or cycle between the beaches.\n105.7 Radio Metro has detailed surf reports at 07:00, 12:00 and 15:00 daily.\n\n\n=== Alcohol-fuelled violence ===\nViolence can erupt late at night and in the early hours of the morning, particularly from Thursday to Saturday. Areas to be careful to avoid include Cavill Ave and Orchid Ave in Surfers Paradise, Broadbeach Mall in Broadbeach and Griffith St in Coolangatta.\n\n\n== Go next ==\n\n\n=== North ===\nBrisbane, the state capital, is about 1 hour north.\nThe Sunshine Coast lies north of Brisbane.\n\n\n=== South ===\nNorthern Rivers region of NSW which includes:\nTweed Shire which starts at the NSW border at Tweed Heads and includes Wollumbin National Park\nAustralia's most easterly point at Cape Byron and Byron Bay (75 km south)\nRegional city of Lismore\n\n\n=== East ===\nCoolangatta airport has inexpensive flights on budget carriers to New Zealand, only about 2 to 3 hours away.\n\n\n=== West ===\nGold Coast Hinterland\nScenic Rim area (60 to 120 km west), a farming area overlooked by Mt Barney, and the quiet town of Boonah.\nGranite Belt (120 to 200 km west) with the towns of Stanthorpe and Warwick"

        "title": "Florence",
        "extract": "Florence (Italian: Firenze) is the capital of the region of Tuscany in Italy, with a population of about 367,000 (2022). The city is a cultural, artistic and architectural gem, and is inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage list. The birthplace of the Italian Renaissance, Florence was the home to powerful families, creative geniuses and scientific masterminds who left their legacies in the city's many museums and art galleries. The city also has a very rich literary history, being the birthplace of the famous poet Dante, and standard Italian today is primarily based on the dialect of Tuscan spoken in Florence.\n\n\n== Understand ==\n\nPolitically, economically, and culturally, Florence was the most important city in Europe for around 250 years, from some time before 1300 until the early 1500s.\nFlorentines reinvented money, in the form of the gold florin. This currency was the engine that drove Europe out of the Dark Ages, a term invented by Petrarch, a Florentine whose family had been exiled to Arezzo. They financed the development of industry all over Europe, from Britain to Bruges, Lyon and Hungary. They financed the English kings during the Hundred Years' War. They financed the papacy, including the construction of the papal palace in Avignon, and the reconstruction of St. Peter's and the Vatican when the papacy returned to Rome from the \"Babylonian captivity\".\nDante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio pioneered the use of the vernacular \u2014 the use of a locally spoken language, rather than Latin \u2014 and in their case, it was Tuscan, which, because of them, became the lingua franca for the entire Italian peninsula, and eventually the basis for standard Italian following unification in 1871. Because Dante, et al., wrote in Tuscan, Geoffrey Chaucer, who spent a lot of time in Northern Italy and who used some of Boccaccio's little stories to inspire his Canterbury Tales, wrote in English. Others started writing in French and Spanish. This was the beginning of the end of Latin as a common language throughout Europe.\nThe Florentines, perhaps most notably Filippo Brunelleschi (1377-1466) and Leon Battista Alberti (1404-1472), invented Renaissance architecture. This architectural style revolutionised the way Rome, London, Paris and every other major city in Europe, from Barcelona to St. Petersburg, was built.\nFlorentines were the driving force behind the Age of Discovery. Florentine bankers financed Henry the Navigator and the Portuguese explorers, who pioneered the route around Africa to India and the Far East. It was a map drawn by the Florentine Paulo del Pozzo Toscanelli, a student of Brunelleschi, that Columbus used to sell his \"enterprise\" to the Spanish monarchs, and which he then used on his first voyage. Mercator's famous \"Projection\" is a refined version of Toscanelli's map, taking into account the Americas, of which the Florentine was obviously ignorant. The western hemisphere itself is named after a Florentine writer who claimed to be an explorer and mapmaker, Amerigo Vespucci.\n\nGalileo and other scientists pioneered the study of optics, ballistics, astronomy, anatomy, and so on. Pico della Mirandola, Leonardo Bruni, Machiavelli, and many others laid the groundwork for our understanding of political science.\nOpera was invented in Florence.\nAnd that is just a smidgen of what went on in this city, which never had a population above 60,000 from the first attack of the plague in 1348 until long, long after it became unimportant.\nAnd there were the Medici, perhaps the most important family that ever lived. The Medicis changed the world more than any other family. Forget all the art for which they paid. They taught first the other Italians, and then the rest of the Europeans, how to conduct statecraft. For example, Catherine de' Medici (1519-1589) married Henry II of France (reigned 1547-1559). After he died, Catherine ruled France as regent for her young sons, and was instrumental in turning France into Europe\u2019s first nation-state. She brought the Renaissance into France, introducing everything from the ch\u00e2teaux of the Loire to the fork. She also was, to 16th- and 17th-century European royalty, what Queen Victoria was to the 19th and 20th centuries \u2014 everybody\u2019s grandmama. Her children included three kings of France, Francis II (ruled 1559-1560), Charles IX (ruled 1560-1574) and Henry III (ruled 1574-1589). Her children-in-law included a fourth king of France, Henry IV (ruled 1589-1610), plus Elizabeth of Hapsburg, Philip II of Spain (of Armada fame), and Mary Queen of Scots.\nAnd that is without mentioning any artists. From Arnolfo and Cimabue to Giotto, Nanni di Banco, and Uccello; through Lorenzo Ghiberti and Donatello and Masaccio and the various della Robbias; through Fra Angelico and Sandro Botticelli and Piero della Francesca, and on to Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci, the Florentines dominated the visual arts like nobody before or since. And this list does not include many who, in any other place, would be considered among the greatest of artists, but in Florence must be considered among the near-great: Benvenuto Cellini, Andrea del Sarto, Benozzo Gozzoli, Giorgio Vasari, Domenico Ghirlandaio, Fra Lippo Lippi, Buontalenti, Orcagna, Pollaiuolo, Filippino Lippi, Andrea del Verrocchio, Bronzino, Desiderio da Settignano, Michelozzo, the Rossellis, the Sangallos, Pontormo. And this list does not include the prolific Ignoto. Nor does it include the near-Florentines, such as Raphael, Andrea Pisano, Giambologna, the wonderfully nicknamed Sodoma and so many more, such as Peter-Paul Rubens, all of whom spent time in Florence and were educated by it.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nFlorence boasts a Mediterranean climate with hot, mostly dry summers and mild, wet winters. Day temperatures during summer are very hot, ranging from 30\u00b0C in June to 33\u00b0C in July and August. Winters experience day temperatures ranging from 11\u00b0C in January to 14\u00b0C in February. Springs and autumns are mild to warm, with day temperatures ranging from 16\u00b0C in November to 27\u00b0C in September. Sunshine is abundant throughout the year, with sunshine hours being very elevated in summer and discretely elevated also in winter.\n\n\n=== Tourist information ===\n Tourist information offices, \u260f +39 055000, touristinfo@comune.fi.it. M-Sa 07:00-21:00, Su 09:00-14:00. Infopoint Piazza Stazione 4 is the largest tourist information in the city, with a bookshop and booking service. Infopoint via Cavour 1R, specialises in the territory all around Florence as well as Florence.  Infopoint Airport Vespucci is found at the Arrivals. Infopoint Borgo Santa Croce 29r has tourist brochures and general tourist information. E-mail enquiries answered within 24 hours. (updated May 2024)\n\n\n== Get in ==\n\n \n\n\n=== By plane ===\nThe airport of Florence itself is Amerigo Vespacci International Airport (FLR IATA) (4 km northwest of the center), locally known as \"Peretola\", to which there are flights from major destinations in Western Europe. There is only one runway covered by hills, and therefore the flights that land there are relatively infrequent and expensive.\nThe airport is connected by tram line T2 connecting the airport to the train station SMN; The station is on the south side, and ends at Piazza dell'Unit\u00e0 Italiana. The tram station is controlled, to the left of the main entrance. The trams run every 5-15 minutes (depending on the time of day) until 12:30 (02:00 on weekends). One-way tickets cost \u20ac1.70 (as of January 2024) and can be purchased with cash or credit cards at vending machines at each station. The tram ride is about 20 minutes from end to end.\nTaxis charge a flat rate of \u20ac25 from the airport to anywhere in the historic center of Florence, plus \u20ac1 per large item of luggage.\nOther airports serving Florence are Bologna and Pisa.\nBologna (BLQ IATA) is the preferred option which is an hour's drive from Florence by car or train. From the airport of Bologna there are flights all over Europe when the dominant airline is Ryanair. From the airport there are also Emirates and Turkish Airlines flights, so these companies can be used to reach Bologna across Asia, Africa and Oceania.\nAnother airport that is used is the airport of Pisa. which is an hour and a half away from florence by train. There are fewer flights to Pisa than Bologna. So Bologna is better option. \nIt is better to book a flight that does not land or take off in the evening, because during these hours the reliability of the trains in Italy is quite low, and it is not worth taking the risk of missing a flight, or the last train. Taxi drivers in Bologna and Pisa, if you get stuck there at night, will not agree to take you to Florence.\nIf you are coming from North America from where there are no flights to either Bologna or Pisa, it is better to use the airport in Rome Fiumicino rather than Milan Malpensa, because from Rome the trip to Florence is much faster.\n\n\n=== By train ===\nFrequent direct trains connect Florence with Rome (90 mins), Milan (1 hr 40 min), Venice (2 hr), Naples (2 hrs 50 min) and Italy's other main cities.\nComing by train from other countries usually involves changing at Milan. However a direct Nightjet runs from Munich leaving around 20:00, reaching Florence around 06:00 and continuing to Rome, with the return leaving Florence towards 22:00 to reach Munich shortly after 08:00. The fare is about \u20ac100. This Nightjet divides and also runs to Vienna, with similar times.\nAlmost all trains go to the main station, 1 Firenze Santa Maria Novella  on the north edge of the historic old town, near most accommodation and sights. There's a bank of Trenitalia ticket machines (cards or cash accepted) on the terminus platform concourse, staffed kiosks in the main hall, and various fast food options there and nearby. An underpass leads south into Piazza SMN.\nA few regional trains bypass SMN, calling at Firenze Campo Marte, 2 km east near Florence Stadium, Firenze Statuto 1 km north of SMN, and Firenze Rifredi, 2 km north of SMN. Unless your ticket specifies otherwise, it's valid for any connecting train between those stations and SMN - you'll seldom have to wait longer than ten minutes. Otherwise, take a bus or taxi from the street outside.\n\n\n=== By car ===\nFlorence is well connected by good highways to the rest of Italy. Autostrada A-1 runs to Bologna, Milan and the North, and to Rome and the South. Use Firenze-Impruneta exit for these routes and for Siena via the \"Fi-Si\" highway. A-11 runs to Pisa and the West: for north of the river follow A-11 to the end, for south of the river turn onto A-1 south to Firenze-Scandicci exit.\nHowever, driving in Florence is very problematic. Driving in the historic centre - inside the wide \"viale\" where the old city walls were (and still are, south of the river) - is strictly prohibited, except for residents with permits. This is ferociously enforced by camera - if you drive in the prohibited areas, you will be hunted down and sent a stiff fine - around \u20ac100 for every camera you pass before escaping the zone. The city raises over \u20ac50 million in traffic fines each year, half of this from traffic zone offences.\nIf you're just visiting for the day, use the Park & Ride areas at the edge of town, for instance Villa Constanza (described below under \"By bus\"). You can't leave your car overnight here.\nIf you're driving to pre-booked accommodation in the centre, check ahead with them: given your car registration (Italian targa) they may be able to get you a 30-minute waiver, barely enough to find the hotel in the warren of old streets, drop luggage and check in, then take the car out of the zone. Central car rental offices likewise have a waiver and permitted route to exit and re-enter the city.\nFirenze Parking run a dozen or so edge-of-centre parking lots, with a long walk or a short bus ride to the centre. For example the lot just north of Piazza della Liberta charges \u20ac10 per day, \u20ac70 per week.\nNear the centre, parking is more expensive: e.g. a garage costs \u20ac30 per night. On the street, you can only use a blue parking space, if you're lucky enough to find one free. White parking places are for residents only and yellow ones are reserved. The price is \u20ac1 per hour and charges apply from 08:00 to 20:00; leave the ticket visible inside the car. You need coins for parking, as the machine won't accept banknotes or cards.\n\n\n=== By bus ===\nFlixbus ply direct between Florence and Rome (3 hr 30, two per hour), Milan (4 hours, roughly hourly), Perugia (2 hours, 4 times), Naples (7 hours, every 2-3 hours), Geneva (12 hours, one overnight, else change in Milan), Marseille (9 hours overnight), Paris (17 hours), Munich (4 per day, 9 hours), Zurich (9 hours), Frankfurt (14 hours), Vienna (12 hours) and Budapest (14 hours).\nBuses that originate or terminate in Florence stop at the downtown bus station on Piazzale Montelungo next to SMN railway station. Buses that are passing Florence between other cities pick up and drop off at 2 Villa Constanza Park & Ride, just off Autostrada A-1 on the west edge of the city - take Tram 1. (And see \"Get around: By tram\" for practicalities.) The parking lot is short of shelter or other facilities.\n3 Busitalia SITA Nord Autostazione, Via Santa Caterina da Siena, 15/17. Main bus stop for Tiemme SpA and CAPautolinee. Which serve many cities in Tuscany and beyond. (updated May 2019)\n\n\n== Get around ==\n\n\n=== On foot ===\nMost of the major tourist sights in Florence are within easy walking distance of each other. It is possible to walk from one end of the historic center of Florence to the other - north-south or east-west - in a half hour. Walking is not only an easy way to get around, it also offers the chance to 'take in' much more of the city life. Be warned though, that electric motor scooters are small enough to fit where cars cannot.  They are relatively quiet but quick and in the summer they often travel into the plazas.  Some of the streets in central Florence are closed to traffic.  Many more are simply too narrow for buses to get through.  Therefore, bus and car tours are not recommended. This is a very small, compact city that really needs to be seen on foot.\n\n\n=== By bicycle ===\nThere is a bike rental service organized by the city. Bikes can be hired at several points in the city (and returned to the same place). One of the most convenient for tourists is at the SMN Station. There are other locations at many railway stations, but often with restricted opening hours. In addition, some hotels provide their guests with free bicycles. Bike shops also often rent bikes and some of them organize guided bike tours in the countryside.\nWhile there are hills north and south of the center of town, almost all of the historic center of Florence is easy for bikers, because it is flat. But there is a problem: traffic is terrible, with buses, trucks, cars, motorcycles, motorbikes, bicycles, and pedestrians fighting for almost no space. However, a network of cycle paths make it often much faster to circumvent the city centre than to cycle directly through historic streets, even if the destination is in an area such as Santa Croce or Santa Maria Novella. \n\n\n=== By taxi ===\nTaxis are available, but it may be best if you have your hotel or the restaurant you are eating at call ahead. When taxis are called by phone, the nearest one available is sent to you through the company's radio system with its meter ticking away. In Florence, it can be difficult to hail a cab from the street curb. You either call for one or get one at the very few taxi stands. One popular taxi stand is at the central Santa Maria Novella Train Station, and there are others in a few major squares. The first taxi in the taxi stand line should be available - ask in case of doubt. Most taxis do not take credit cards for payment, so be sure to have cash on hand. Taxis in Florence are relatively expensive. Tipping is not expected, unless the driver helps you carry luggage, etc.\n\n\n=== By bus ===\nAnother way of getting around is by using the public buses from AutolineeToscane. \nA single-ride ticket costs \u20ac1.70, a carnet of 10 tickets is \u20ac14 (as of 2024 these are no longer easily available). \nThere are different ways of obtaining a ticket:\n\nPaper tickets can be bought at tabacchi (shops selling tobacco, which are marked with official looking \"T\"s out front\"), kiosks/newsagents/bars where the symbol \"Biglietti AutolineeToscane\" is shown, as well as at the AutolineeToscane ticketing office at the bus station outside Santa Maria Novella train station.\nContactless via debit/credit card at the card readers in your choice of transport, provided your card is branded with a Visa, Mastercard or American Express logo. For urban lines (marked green), simply tap on when getting onto the vehicle; for lines operated on a distance-based fare, also tap off upon leaving the vehicle. Within the ticket's validity period, a new tap in another vehicle will not be charged again.\nWithin 90 minutes of stamping/tapping you can hop-off & hop-on on any bus of the urban AutolineeToscane network. Paper tickets need to be stamped when entering the bus (from the front and rear doors of buses - the central door is supposed to be exit only; though now it is more accepted to enter from the central door).  If you are unable to find a ticket vendor, there also ticket machines at some locations accept ING contactless card payment and coins. \nA ticket may also be available from the driver for \u20ac2.50, but there is no guarantee that the driver will agree to sell them.\nHold tightly onto the hand rails as Florence traffic is unpredictable and frequent sudden braking is necessary. Unlike bigger cities such as Rome or Naples, buses in Florence are relatively \"safe.\"  Keep a close eye on your belongings and avoid showing off cash, jewelry, etc., especially in very crowded buses.\n\n\n=== By tram ===\nThere are two tram lines in the city. The first one runs from Villa Constanza Park & Ride on the south-western edge of the city, just off the A-1, so most users are commuters. It runs into town through the western burbs of Scandicci and L'Isolotto to SMN main railway station (25 min), then turns north to Rifredi and the University/Hospital area. It runs daily 05:00-00:30 every three to ten minutes, and a single ride costs \u20ac1.50. The second line connects the airport and the near west side to the city centre and the Santa Maria Novella station. By 2025, the network will have been extended to Piazza della Libert\u00e0 and Piazza San Marco.\n\n\n=== By car ===\nDon't even think of it - see \"Get in\". Just thinking of it is probably enough to incur a fine.\n\n\n== See ==\n\nLearn from Stendahl and don't try to see too much. Most tourists rush to do the Uffizi, the Duomo and the Bargello. These are indeed splendid, but you may wait hours to get in, and be jostled by tour groups. Pre-book if you know you want to see them; otherwise spread out and see stuff that is equally fine but less touristy. A long weekend here could comfortably take in a sprinkling of old churches, and a couple of museums or galleries. But leave time and energy for just enjoying the ambience.\nChurches: the standout is definitely the Duomo or Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore. But other fine churches north of the river include San Lorenzo, Santa Maria Novella, Santa Trinita, Santa Croce, Santo Spirito, SS Annunziata and Ognissanti. Highlights south of the river are Santa Maria del Carmine and San Miniato al Monte.\nArt galleries: aim to do at least one of Uffizi, Pitti Palace, Accademia, Bargello and the Museum of the Works of the Duomo. They are filled with the brilliant creations of all the renaissance big names: Donatello, Verrochio, Desiderio da Settignano, and Michelangelo. There are also several modern galleries.\nCity views: the classic panorama is from Piazzale Michelangelo, on the hillside just south of the river, and from San Miniato al Monte a little higher up. But every tour bus pauses here for photos so it can get mobbed. There is also a great view from the dome of the Cathedral or Giotto's Bell Tower, and an even greater line to climb them.\nConsider whether you'll benefit from buying a Firenzecard, described earlier.\nFlorence is featured in Assassin's Creed II; see Assassin's Creed Tour.\n\n\n=== Piazza del Duomo ===\n\nThe Cathedral, Santa Maria del Fiore, is an astonishing confection dominating the piazza below and the skyline above. It's the fourth largest Christian church in the world, behind the Basilica of Our Lady of Peace in Yamoussoukro, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire; St Peter's in Rome; and St Paul's in London. It's an early example of \"technology-forcing\" - like the US lunar missions of the 1960s, the 13th-century Florentines started building it without knowing how they'd complete it, until along came Brunelleschi and his vast crowning dome. The eye-catching facade is 19th-century. In front of the cathedral is the ornate medieval Baptistery, in use until modern times. Also in the piazza is the Bell Tower, designed by Giotto. The artwork from these buildings has been replaced by replicas, with the originals in the adjacent Museum of the Works of the Duomo. Buy a combined ticket online for \u20ac18 (concessions \u20ac3) to enter the following monuments (one entry per monument, valid for 72 hours after first use, book up to 30 days ahead; all closed first Tuesday of the month):\n\n1 Santa Maria del Fiore (Duomo) (Enter by right hand door in west facade; disabled access on south flank). M-Sa 10:00-16:30, Su 13:30-16:45. The cathedral interior is to a basilica pattern; it's vast and at first feels dark and empty. Give your eyes time to adjust, and admire the stained glass windows, funeral monument of Bishop d'Orso, and altar of St Zanobius. Below is the Crypt (M-Sa 10:00-17:00) with remains of the preceding cathedral of Santa Reparata, and the tomb of Brunelleschi. Giotto is believed to lie here somewhere, but his tomb has yet to be identified. Above is the soaring cupola or Dome. The cathedral is free, but you need a pre-booked ticket and time-slot to climb the 464 steps up to the Dome (entrance north side of the church). Slots are available M-F 08:30-19:00, Sa 08:30-17:00 and Su 13:00-16:00.   (updated May 2019)\n2 Giotto's Tower (Campanile di Giotto). Daily 08:15-19:00. Almost 85 m (279 ft) tall, with 414 steps to climb, this richly decorated tower is topped by an open terrace with a panorama of the Duomo, city and surrounds. By ticket.   (updated Nov 2018)\n3 Baptistery. M-F 08:15-10:15 & 11:15-19:30, Sa 08:15-18:30, Su 08:15-13:30. Octagonal plan, with a pyramidal roof covering its dome. It's famous for its bronze doors by Andrea Pisano (14th century) and Lorenzo Ghiberti (15th century) and a beautiful interior vault decorated with 13th-century mosaics. The interior is being restored and is unviewable as of April 2024, though the exterior can be seen. By ticket.   (updated Nov 2018)\n4 Museo dell'Opera del Duomo (Museum of the Works of the Duomo), Piazza del Duomo 9 (Directly behind the dome end of the cathedral). F-W 09:00-19:00, Th 09:00-17:00. This houses original artworks from the Duomo and surrounding religious buildings, including sculptures by Donatello, a Michelangelo Piet\u00e0 (different from his version in Saint Peter's, Rome) and the losing entries in the 1401 contest to design the doors of the Baptistery. Plus models and drawings of the Cathedral. By ticket.   (updated Nov 2018)\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nBook ahead for the big-name museums. All of these (plus Boboli Gardens) have a combined booking portal and there are several combi-tickets. In practice, it's Uffizi that draws the biggest crowds and so is hardest to access; your options are:\n\n- Just wait in line. On a good day this could mean a 4- to 5-hour wait, hopefully in good weather. On a bad day you wait hours outside in bad weather then they sell out and turn you away. This is especially likely on the first Sunday of the month when entry is free. Tuesday too is crowded, since it's closed Monday so there's pent-up demand.\n- Go on an organised tour - these have a pre-booked slot and you step right in. Caveat emptor, as tour operations range from the shambolic and rushed to the sublime and educating.\n- Buy a Firenzecard, so you skip the usual line. Upmarket hotels sometimes also have access to priority slots.\n- Book online, paying \u20ac4 extra and pre-printing your email for a fixed time slot. Be there at least an hour ahead, because so many people are skipping line, there's a line to skip the line.\n- Book by phone on +39 055 294883, likewise paying \u20ac4 extra for a fixed slot and arriving an hour early. It's not clear how long you'll typically wait to get through by phone.\n\n5 Galleria degli Uffizi, Piazzale degli Uffizi, \u260f +39 055 294883. Tu-Su 08:15-18:50, M closed, last admission 18:00; you may not bring in water. Outstanding fine art museum with Renaissance paintings and sculptures from classical antiquity. It's in a late 16th-century palazzo designed by Vasari, in two wings enclosing a long narrow courtyard, effectively a street, an innovation in its day. Originally the palazzo was magistrates' offices (hence \"Uffizi\") and state archives; then it came to house the Medici's vast art collection. The artworks are on the first and second floors, they keep the lifts well hidden. Highlights include Birth of Venus by Boticelli, Dukes of Urbino by della Francesca, Medusa by Caravaggio, Venus of Urbino by Titian, Annunciation by da Vinci, Pope Leo X and family by Raphael, Velasquez' self-portrait, Rembrandt's final self-portrait, and many other big names. Allow three hours for a visit. Uffizi specialises in the Renaissance, so although later styles are represented, examples are few: you don't really come here for the 18th- to 20th-century material. The restaurant/caf\u00e8 has a large balcony overlooking the main piazza with good views of the Palazzo Vecchio, and naturally their prices reflect the views. High season (21 Feb-9 Nov; 21 Dec-9 Jan): adult \u20ac29 (or \u20ac23 for early morning tickets: 08:15 and 08:30), conc \u20ac6, combi with Pitti & Boboli \u20ac38; low season: adult \u20ac16, conc \u20ac6, combi \u20ac18; including a booking fee of \u20ac4.

Daily Apr-Oct: 08:15-17:00, Nov-Feb: 08:15-14:00, but closed 2nd & 4th Su and 1st, 3rd & 5th M of each month. Used as a barracks and prison until the 19th century, this museum houses some of the best Renaissance and Mannerist sculpture. Big names here include Michelangelo, Donatello, Ammannati, Bandinelli, Andrea and Jacopo Sansovino, Desiderio da Settignano, Giambologna, and Antonio Rossellino. It also displays ceramics, textiles & tapestries, ivory, silver, armour and coins. Allow two hours. Not nearly as crowded as the Uffizi or Galleria dell'Accademia and paying a fee to book in advance is likely not necessary. Adult \u20ac11, conc \u20ac4, booking fee \u20ac3.   (updated Sep 2023)\n7 Galleria dell'Accademia (Accademia Gallery), Via Ricasoli 58-60. Tu-Su 08:15-18:50. Highlights are Michelangelo's original David (the one in Piazza della Signoria is a copy) and his unfinished  Slaves. It also includes Florentine painting, a museum of musical instruments, and Russian icons. No photography is allowed inside. N.B. the \"Accademia di Belle Arti\" next door is a university department, not connected with the Gallery. Adult \u20ac16, conc \u20ac4, booking fee \u20ac4.   (updated Nov 2018)\n8 Palazzo Pitti (Pitti Palace), Piazza de' Pitti (200 m south of Ponte Vecchio). Tu-Su 08:15-18:50, last admission 18:00. The original Pitti was a banker; the palace has housed royalty but became best known for its Medici family treasures. It's now divided into four museums (same ticket): ground floor is the Treasury of the Grand Dukes; first floor houses the Palatine Gallery and the Royal and Imperial Apartments, second floor is the Modern Art Gallery and the Museum of Costume and Fashion. The Boboli gardens are just behind the palazzo. Mar-Oct: adult \u20ac16, conc \u20ac8, combi with Uffizi & Boboli \u20ac38; Nov-Feb: adult \u20ac10, conc \u20ac5, combi \u20ac18; booking fee \u20ac4.

(updated May 2019)\n10 Museo Galileo, Piazza dei Giudici 1, \u260f +39 055 265 311. 9:30-18:00. This museum shows the evolution of the instruments used in various scientific fields such as mathematics, physics, biology, chemistry, astronomy. The room of Galileo Galilei shows some of his original instruments as well as models from his drawings. The room of Spheres and Globes houses an excellent cartographic collection. In a rather macabre twist the museum also has the middle finger of Galileo's right hand on display. \u20ac10.   (updated May 2019)\n11 Museo Horne, Palazzo Corsi on via dei Benci, 6. Th-Tu 10:00-14:00. Displays art and furnishings of the 14th & 15th century. The building and art collection were owned by art historian Herbert Percy Horne. \u20ac7.   (updated May 2019)\n12 Archaeological Museum, Piazza della Santissima Annunziata 9B. The Etruscan art collection is particularly good. \u20ac8.

Sa-M 10:00 - 19:00, other days by reservation. Houses the work of that contemporary sculptor.   (updated May 2019)\nA Contemporary Art gallery is sited in 15 Palazzo Strozzi , and there are several other collections around city centre.\n16 Stibbert Museum (Montughi hill, 2 km north of city centre). M-W 10:00-14:00, F-Su 10:00-18:00. Has a great collection of armour and arms. \u20ac8.   (updated May 2019)\n\n\n=== Old town centre ===\n\n17 Palazzo Vecchio. Old city palace/city hall, adorned with fine art. The replica of Michelangelo's \"David\" is placed outside the main door in the original location of the statue, which is a symbol of the Comune of Florence. The site displays an important collection of Renaissance sculptures and paintings, including the Putto by Verrochio and the series of murals by Giorgio Vasari at the Salone dei Cinquecento (Hall of the Five Hundreds) - the hall which used to display the now lost Renaissance masterpiece, that is, the so-called Battaglia di Anghiari, by Leonardo da Vinci. \"Museum\" or \"Tower and Battlements\": \u20ac12.50 adults, \u20ac10 concessions. \"Museum\" and \"Tower and Battlements\": \u20ac17.50 adults, \u20ac15 concessions.   (updated Aug 2022)\nPiazza della Signoria is the grand open space in front: not quite a square, as Palazzo Vecchio blocks out one corner. Sights here are the equestrian statue of Cosimo de Medici, the Fountain of Neptune, the statue of David, and Loggia dei Lanzi, an open arched gallery of Renaissance sculpture.\n18 Ponte Vecchio. The oldest and most celebrated bridge over the Arno, and the only Florentine bridge to survive World War II. The design is distinctive: it's a three-arched bridge supporting a parade of shops supporting another bridge. It dates to 1345 (hence Ponte Vecchio, \"old bridge\"), with earlier bridges being swept away by floods, rebuilt and swept away again. At street level it's a pedestrianised cobbled arch. It's lined by shops, which were butchers until Renaissance times then - in an insight as dramatic as the discovery of perspective in painting - they realised that goldsmiths' shops paid higher rents and didn't stink; so from then to this day it's just been overpriced jewellery shops and market stalls. Above these is the higher bridge, the Vasari Corridor, a private walkway added in 1565 so that the Medici Dukes could move between Palazzo Vecchio (Town Hall) and Palazzo Pitti (their blingy residence) without mixing with common folk. On the south bank, the Corridor nowadays continues as a gallery of the Uffizi, and there is sometimes talk of extending this over the bridge, or otherwise making the space accessible. Nothing's come of this so far, so the common folk will have to continue admiring the scene from street level. Free.   (updated Nov 2018)\n\n19 Santa Croce. Contains the monumental tombs of Galileo, Michelangelo, Machiavelli, Dante, Rossini, and many other notables in addition to artistic decorations. There is also great artwork in the church. The Museo dell'Opera di Santa Croce (included in ticket) displays a flood-damaged but still beautiful Crucifix by Cimabue (Giotto's teacher), which has become a symbol of the disastrous floods of 1966. The ticket also includes Pazzi Chapel, a perfectly symmetrical example of sublime neo-Classic Renaissance architecture. Adult \u20ac8, concs \u20ac6.   (updated May 2019)\n20 Santa Maria Novella (near the train station). A beautiful church with great artwork, including a Trinity by Masaccio that is being restored as of April 2024 but can still be seen from the scaffold for an additional charge of \u20ac1.50 and a great series of frescoes by Ghirlandaio behind the altar. Also, the museum near the Chiostro Verde, outside the church to its left (follow the signs in the church), contains gently restored frescoes of Old Testament scenes by Paolo Uccello which are quite unusual in style and well worth seeing. Off of another cloister is the wonderful Spanish Chapel which is covered in huge, impressive 14th-century frescoes. Also don't miss the Cappella Strozzi di Mantova, up a flight of stairs at the end of the left transept, with dramatic frescoes of Heaven, Hell and Purgatory by Nardo di Cione. The gift shop is in the Sacristy, which also contains paintings and other artwork. Allotting 1 1/2-2 hours to see everything would be reasonable. \u20ac7.50 adults, \u20ac5 concessions.   \n21 Orsanmichele. A beautiful old church from the 14th century, which once functioned as a grain market.   \n22 San Lorenzo. The fa\u00e7ade of this church was never completed, giving it a striking, rustic appearance. Inside the church is pure Renaissance neo-classical splendor. If you go around the back of the church, there is a separate entrance to the Medici chapels. Be sure to check out the stunning burial chapel of the princes and the sacristy down the corridor. The small sacristy is blessed with the presence of nine Michelangelo sculptures.   \n23 San Marco Convent. Houses frescoes by Fra Angelico and his workshop. Fra Angelico painted a series of frescoes for the cells in which the Dominican monks lived.   \n24 Great Synagogue and Jewish Museum of Florence (Sinagoga e Museo Ebraico Firenze), Via Luigi Carlo Farini 6 (around the corner from Piazza Sant'Ambrogio), \u260f +39 055 298 9879, firenzebraica@operalaboratori.com. Jun-Sep: M-Th 10:00 - 18:30, F 10:00 - 17:00; Oct-May: Su-Th 10:00 - 17:30, F 10:00 - 15:00. Closed except for religious services on Saturdays and Jewish holidays. Lovely Moorish-style synagogue built in 1882 and a museum with many artefacts and documentation of Florentine Jewish life going back many centuries; audio tours in multiple languages are available. \u20ac6.50 total for the synagogue and museum.   (updated Nov 2021)\n25 The English Cemetery (Cimitero degli inglesi), Piazzale Donatello (a short walk from the Great Synagogue and Jewish Museum of Florence). In the 19th century, the \"English Cemetery\" received anyone that the city's churchyards wouldn't receive, e.g. Orthodox Christians, but Britons and Americans were the majority. Famous names here include Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Fanny Trollope and Beatrice Shakespeare, a relative of William. There are lots of ornate gravestones with flowery inscriptions in multiple languages.   (updated Nov 2021)\n\n\n=== South bank of the Arno ===\n\n26 Santa Felicita (just south of Ponte Vecchio). Contains frescoes of the Annunciation and a painting of the Deposition of Christ by the brilliant and weird mannerist painter, Pontormo. They are to be found in the Barbadori Chapel, which is to your immediate right when entering the church.   \nPitti Palace: see Museum listing above.\n27 Boboli Gardens. Elaborately landscaped and with many interesting sculptures, behind the Pitti Palace. Wonderful city views. Don't miss the Bardini gardens. Entrance to that is included in the combination ticket price for the Boboli, and it's a short walk from the Boboli Gardens. There are great views of the Duomo from the Bardini gardens. Adult \u20ac10.   (updated May 2019)\nNatural History Museum (\"La Specola\") is on Via Romana next to Pitti Palace. Open Tu-Su 09:00-16:00.\n28 Santa Maria del Carmine. Famous frescoes (Masaccio\u2019s Adam and Eve Banished From the Garden and others by Lippi and Masolino) in the Brancacci Chapel.   \n29 Piazzale Michelangelo (Michelangelo Square). Plaza on a hillside with a great view of the city. Go there by bus or climb the stairs and paths from the Lungarno della Zecca.   \n30 San Miniato al Monte (uphill from Piazzale Michelangelo). The Sacristy contains frescoes by Spinello Aretino. In the cemetery near this church there are graves of famous people of Florence, including Carlo Lorenzi (Collodi) - author of the famous Pinocchio. Also, turn around when you reach the top of the stairs before entering the church, to see perhaps an even greater view of the city than from nearby Piazzale Michelangelo.   \nMuseo Stefano Bardini: collection of early Florentine art, housed in the Palazzo Mozzi just south of Ponte alla Grazia. It's open F-M 11:00-17:00.\n\n\n== Do ==\n\nGreat places to walk include along the Arno and across any of its bridges; through narrow, medieval back streets in the Santa Croce area; and in the Oltr'Arno, on the south side of the river, which is in many ways like Rome's Trastevere or Paris's Left Bank, but far, far smaller.\n\nClimb the Duomo or Campanile: Traverse the winding staircases inside the Duomo or the nearby bell tower to see some of the best views of Florence. Not only can you see the Tuscan countryside in the distance and the impressive palaces and churches of Florence in the fore, but it also shows you just how large the Duomo is.\nStroll the Boboli Gardens: These extensive gardens behind the Pitti palace provide excellent views of the city of Florence and numerous sculptures in a relaxed environment. Stop in the hilltop caf\u00e9, grab a drink and a seat outside and enjoy the view.\nStreet performers strut their stuff in front of Palazzo Vecchio of an evening. Performances can range from violin duets to people dressed as sculptures. A nice place to stop while you eat your after-dinner gelato.\n Enjoy the view from the Piazzale Michelangelo. It's a big square on a hill, but somewhat distant from the traditional tourist sites. It's easy to reach it even on foot using the stairs called \"Rampe di San Niccol\u00f2\". They are on the side of the Arno RIver just in front of the national library. Do this during the summer and during the night to admire Florence's lights. \nJoin a monastery: those aged 18-35 are invited to take a two-day spiritual retreat at Badia Fiorentina on Via del Proconsolo. Or just come to hear sung vespers at 18:00 and mass at 18:30 nightly in this peaceful church, filled with artwork. It's central yet virtually free of tourists.\nFootball: ACF Fiorentina play soccer in Serie A, Italy's top tier. Their home ground Stadio Artemio Franchi (capacity 43,000) is 2 km northeast of city centre.\n\n\n=== Further out ===\n Impruneta spa, Via Cassia 217, Terme di Firenze (from the city of Florence, take the Autostradale Firenze - Siena and the SR2; the spa is on a lefthand turnoff from the R2, approximately 13 km south of the city of Florence). The thermal waters of Impruneta spring from two sources and are used to treat respiratory diseases, liver, gastrointestinal, and skin allergies. \n\n\n== Learn ==\n\n\n=== Photography ===\n Florence Photography Workshop & Tour, \u260f +39 348 840 0459, info@florenceinferno.com. 12:00-18:00 (13:30-19:30 in July and August).

Italian language school offering language and cultural courses since 1982. \n1 Centro Machiavelli, Piazza Santo Spirito 4, \u260f +39 0552396966, school@centromachiavelli.it. Italian language and cultural school for foreigners. The structure and the contents of the programmes for the levels are based on the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages. The school also organises a programme of cultural activities and excursions to complement the language classes and enable the students to come into contact with the Italian culture and practice Italian in the field. (updated Aug 2016)\n Istituto Galilei, Via Alfani 68, \u260f +39 055 29 46 80, fax: +39 055 28 34 81, info@galilei.it. Italian language school specializing in one-to-one, personalized and small group (max 4 people) full immersion courses. \n Michelangelo Institute, Via Ghibellina 88, \u260f +39 055 240975, michelangelo@dada.it.

M-F 08:00-17:30. Offers a wide choice of Italian language and culture courses for children and adults from beginning to advanced levels. \n\n\n=== Cooking ===\n Cooking Class. Florence and Tuscany are becoming synonymous with \"cooking class\". Tuscan cuisine is appreciated worldwide and a cooking class experience is now more and more part of the attraction of Tuscany, as a way of carrying back home memories and improved cooking skills. There are many in the area, either in historical villas in the countryside or in central Florence, from Florentine use of tripe and giblets to the use of organic ingredients from the local producers, and classes range widely in size. During high season, make sure to book in advance. \n\n\n== Buy ==\n\nThere are a few places to buy things, from the high-end jewelry stores lining the Ponte Vecchio to some of the most famous shops in the world \u2014 Gucci, Pucci, Ferragamo, Valentino, Prada, Armani, Ermenegildo Zegna, Buccellati, Frette \u2014 as well as many more wonderful shops that aren't yet world famous. Souvenirs related to art and Florence's sights can be found everywhere. Books, leather goods, art handcrafted journals, frames, pencils etc. in that gorgeous Florentine paper with swirls of color and gold are great gifts.\nIt is increasingly difficult to find bargains, but keen-eyed shoppers can still find good deals on smaller side streets running off of those above and elsewhere in the centre of town. Better stores in/near the city centre offer superb leather, sometimes at decent prices, perhaps after some bargaining. Goldsmiths on the Ponte Vecchio display beautiful, quality work but can be very expensive. Shops that are not in the very centre of the city are significantly cheaper. There are also superb shopping streets, such as Via Tornabuoni, Via del Parione, and Via Maggio. The San Lorenzo Market is now largely for tourists. There are also a couple of collections of \"outlets\" in the suburbs.\nSome of the most uniquely Florentine shops and sights can be found in the Oltrarno, which is Florence's \"Left Bank\" and home to countless generations of artisans. This section of town can be found by crossing \"Ponte Vecchio\" (the old bridge) or Ponte Trinit\u00e0 from the center. This \"undiscovered\" Florence is a must-see.\n\n Enoteca Mondovino, Via S. Agostino 27-29/R, \u260f +39 055 215214. Decent wine and liquor store with interesting collection of potable bitters in the back (Italian and German). \n1 Officina Profumo-Farmaceutica di Santa Maria Novella, Via della Scala 16 N. With roots dating to 1221, this shop sells high-quality beauty products like soaps, shaving cream, eau de Cologne and Carta D'Armenia incense papers in a shop that was once the chapel of San Niccol\u00f2.Worth entering even just to see the space and smell the herbal products made from historic recipes. \n Pitti Vintage - Italian & European Vintage Clothing & Accessories, Borgo degli Albizi 72r, \u260f +39 055 230 2676, shopkeeper@PittiVintage.com.

M 15:00-19:00, Tu-Sa 09:00-13:00, 15:00-19:00. Long-established antiques and home decor store located among the traditional artisans' workshops of Oltrarno. Within it, Recollection sells vintage clothing and accessories. (updated Nov 2018)\nBeware: If the police catch you while buying a knock-off version of something with a brand from an (illegal) street vendor, you can be fined up to \u20ac10,000. You'll see plenty of people on the street selling imitation Gucci sunglasses, Rolex watches, and Prada purses dirt cheap. It's okay if the item doesn't have a real brand on it, but buying a knock-off is illegal.\n\n\n== Eat ==\n\nRestaurants have separate prices for food that is taken away or is eaten standing up versus sit down; don't try to sit at a table after paying for food or coffee from the restaurant's take away booth. Also ask always beforehand for the price if you want to sit at a table. Otherwise you might be uncomfortably surprised. Cappuccino al banco i.e. standing up might cost \u20ac1-3, but at a table \u20ac4.\nFlorence's food can be as much of a treat to the palate as the art is a treat to the eye. There is good food for any price range, from fine restaurants to take out food from window stands. You will find the best price/quality ratio outside the historical centre, where locals go to eat. The worst ratio is probably in the neighbourhood of Mercato di San Lorenzo or immediately south of the Duomo where there are a lot of tourist restaurants. Conversely many of the best restaurants in the city are found in the Santa Croce district or across the river in the Oltrarno. In many trattorias requests for pizza may be met with a rebuff as not every trattoria will have a pizza oven. For local pizza look for smaller establishments in the Sant'Ambrogio district.\nThe best lunch places don't always turn out to be the best dinner places. Dinner in Florence really starts some time between 19:00 and 21:00. If a place looks like they're preparing to close before 20:00, it might not be the best option for an evening meal.\nTypical Tuscan courses include bistecca alla fiorentina which is huge t-bone steak weighing from 500g to 1,500g. It has always price given per 100g, e.g. \u20ac3.5 etto (an etto is a \"hectogram\" or 100 gram-ettogrammo). crostini toscani are crostini with Tuscan liver p\u00e2t\u00e9.\nThere is also a uniquely Florentine fast food with a 1,000-year history - lampredotto, a kind of tripe (cow stomach, or calf for preference, but a different part than the more familiar white \"honeycomb\" kind, dark brown in color; the name comes from its wrinkled appearance, which apparently reminds locals of a lamprey fish). The trippaio set their carts in the public squares in the centre, dishing out the delicacy straight from the cauldron in which it is being boiled with herbs and tomatoes, chopping it and slapping the portions between halves of a Tuscan roll; the top is dipped in the broth. A mild green parsley- or basil-based sauce or a hot red one goes with it.\nThere are many gelato (Italian ice cream) stands; some connoisseurs consider the better Florentine gelato the finest in the world. Often gelato is made in the bar where you buy it. Because of this there are many exotic flavors of ice cream like watermelon, spumante or garlic. It's hard to find a gelato place open very late, so after dinner might not be an option. Near the Duomo, though, there are a few places open after 22:00.\nTuscany is also the wellspring of cantuccini, also called biscotti di Prato. (In Italian, the singular of biscotti is un biscotto.) It's traditional to enjoy them after a meal by dipping them in vin santo (\"holy wine\"), a concentrated wine made from late-harvested grapes, but you can also buy bags of them in stores throughout the city and eat them however you like.\n\n\n=== Budget ===\nThere are numerous caff\u00e8 and pasticcerie where you can find excellent sandwiches. Schiacciata sandwiches are one of the most famous Florentine specialities, and can be the most affordable meals available with a typical cost of \u20ac4-7. The most famous Sandwich shop L'Antico Vinaio near the Palazzo Vecchio has become extremely popular due to social media interest and one can queue for up to 45 minutes to buy one there. There are many equally good (if not better) and cheaper Schiacciata options available nearby.\nPizza sold by weight is an equally excellent solution for budget dining (vegetarian and vegan options are almost always available), as is any caff\u00e8 displaying a \"Primi\" card in its window where you'll find pastas and other dishes at low reasonable prices. The delis (rosticcerie) are very affordable (and the food is often quite good), and some also have dining tables if you don't want to take away.\nYou can buy the makings for a picnic or snack at the Mercato Centrale. This large market has everything you might need, often at lower prices than supermarkets. The stalls will also sometimes vacuum seal whatever you buy so you can take it home with you.\nA general rule: the closer you are to the historic old town, the higher the price.\n\n\n==== Old Town ====\n1 I fratellini, Via dei Cimatori, 38R, \u260f +39 055 239 6096. Daily 10:00-20:00. Good street food: panini for \u20ac5 (Mar 2024) and wine for \u20ac2+ (Oct 2018) from a tiny hole in the wall. Patrons eat on the sidewalk while resting their glass of wine on small shelves nested along the street wall. (updated May 2022)\n2 Trattoria Mario, Via Rosina 2/R (near Piazza Mercato Centrale), \u260f +39 055 218550. M-Sa 12:00-15:30. Lunch only, no booking, you'll be seated with other walk-ins. Good food, try to save room for a meat main course. (updated May 2022)\n3 Trattoria Le Mossacce, Via Del Proconsolo, 55R (Corner of Via del Corso), \u260f +39 055 294361.

The upstairs can be a private lounge for parties or VIP section on certain nights. This club was the most popular on Wednesday nights, but it\u2019s open on the weekends as well.

All ages are appropriate and the dress attire here is rather upscale. This is not just a seasonal club so all year visitors are encouraged to go. Drinks run about \u20ac10 each. \n1 Bamboo Lounge Club, Via Giuseppe Verdi, 57/R, \u260f +39 3394298764, info@bambooloungeclub.com. 23:00-04:00.

Many people come from all over to enjoy this club's atmosphere. The dance floor is extremely large and is always very crowded. Be smart where you keep your bag and wallet because it\u2019s very easy to get pick pocketed in large clubs like this. This club usually has a cover of \u20ac20 and the drinks are rather expensive, but it is a great place to experience at least once. It is very different than most of the clubs in Florence because of the multi-story building. To venture here would be best by taxi or bus. Since it is located in the outskirts of Florence walking could be difficult and not advised. There are many people who can help in directions in the Santa Maria Novella Station. \n\n\n== Sleep ==\nAs elsewhere the price of hotels in Florence has been climbing quickly in the last few years. The golden rule here is if you want something cheap you'll have to stay outside of the historic center. The area around the train station is cheaper, but not as safe, especially for women travelers at night. If you are looking at big chain hotels you should be aware that they are usually quite a distance from the centre, the Novotel for instance is almost at the airport.\nCertain hotels, particularly those oriented toward business travellers offer special reduced rates during the weekend (e.g. Starhotel Michelangelo) or during slow weeks like Baglioni. Sometimes you can also get a substantial discount by reserving online. In the train station there is a tourist information office which also offers hotel reservations; you can often get good deals through them at the very last minute, but it's not guaranteed.\n\n\n=== Budget ===\nThere are quite a number of one or two star alberghi within a short distance of the station.\nYoung women can find accommodation with certain convents at very low prices, and usually in historic locations. On the other hand, you'll have to forget about any late-night Tuscan craziness.\n\n\n==== Camping ====\nThere are campsites round the edge of town: to SW is Ostello Tasso Ente, north is Elite Firenze Gestioie SRL, NE is Camping Albergue, east is Me & Mom in Tuscany, and 3 others further east in Rovezzano.

(updated Jul 2022)\n\n\n== Connect ==\nFlorence has 5G from all Italian carriers, but as of Sept 2021 coverage remains patchy.\n\n\n== Stay safe ==\nFlorence is generally safe and healthy, but beware the inevitable purse-snatchers and pickpockets. They thrive in crowds, particularly around SMN railway station and on the buses, sometimes working with a decoy such as an insistent beggar. If you have a bag with a classy, noiseless zipper, it will be opened.\nAlso beware at night around tourist spots such as Ponte Vecchio where pickpocketers may approach you pretending to be drunk and friendly, and then snatch your belongings when your guard is down.\n\n\n== Go next ==\n\nFlorence is a great starting point and base for a tour of Tuscany. Attractive day trips include Pisa, Lucca, San Gimignano, Arezzo, Pistoia,  Fiesole, Lucignano, Siena, and of course the wine zone of Chianti. Greve in Chianti is the market town of the Chianti zone and it is in the hills surrounding Greve that you can rent a B&B room or a small apartment on a working vineyard for less than a hotel in Florence. The SITA Pullman buses take you to Greve and Panzano in about an hour. From then on you see few cars and many cypress and olive trees.\nThe SITA bus station is just west of the train station in Florence. This is where to go to catch a bus to Siena, San Gimignano, and so on. If you're at the roundabout, facing the train station, go 90 degrees left and stay on the left until just past the fork. You will see the entrance to the SITA garage on your right.\n1 Fiesole. A town in the hills above Florence, only a short bus ride away from the centre. It offers a beautiful view of the sunset, and a small museum located on ancient Roman and Etruscan ruins of a temple, an amphitheatre and a pretty, small duomo.   \n2 World War II Florence American Cemetery and Memorial (12 km (7.5 miles) south of Florence on the west side of Via Cassia. The Rome-Milan highway passes near the cemetery. 20 min bus ride from the Sita Station, just ask agent (get a return ticket)). Open daily except for 25 December and 1 January; 09:00-17:00. The cemetery is the final resting place for 4,402 American military dead lost during after the capture of Rome and the battle for the Apennines. A monument is inscribed with the names of 1,409 Americans whose remains were never found or identified. The atrium of the chapel contains marble maps of World War II Italy campaign. Free to enter. \nBiking options outside of the city include the Chianti area, where you can fully enjoy the hills and the elegance of the landscape surrounding you, which has been taken care of endlessly through centuries. Strong scents can be enjoyed in Spring. The warm temperatures and usually stable weather in the good seasons can make the ride even more enjoyable. If you feel more energetic, ascents to Vallombrosa from Pontassieve through Tosi can be very enjoyable. You start from the Arno river plain and you end up in a thick, shady, fresh forest. In all cases, avoid the hottest hours in Summer and be aware of the traffic, which can be heavy and not cyclist-savvy, until you get in secondary or less populated roads.\nUNESCO World Heritage Listed rural building complexes (Medici Villas and Gardens) are scattered around Florence:\n3 Gardens of Pratolino (Parco Mediceo di Pratolino).

        "title": "Kathmandu",
        "extract": "Kathmandu (Nepali: \u0915\u093e\u0920\u092e\u093e\u0921\u094c) is the largest city and capital of Nepal and the namesake of the Kathmandu Valley. Once thought to be the fabled and inaccessible Shangri-La, Kathmandu is a fast-growing spot catering to a wide range of holiday types and budgets. As a result of considerable urban growth in recent decades, it is now part of one continuous urban area together with Patan to the south.\n\n\n== Districts ==\n\n\n== Understand ==\nAccording to a census conducted in 2011, Kathmandu metropolis has 2.5 million inhabitants, and the agglomeration has a population of more than 3 million inhabitants. The metropolitan city area is 50.67 km\u00b2 (19.56 sq mi) and has a population density of 3000 per km\u00b2 and 17,000 per km square in the city proper.\nThe city stands at an elevation of approximately 1,400 metres (4,600 ft) in the bowl-shaped Kathmandu Valley of central Nepal. It is surrounded by four major mountains: Shivapuri, Phulchoki, Nagarjun, and Chandragiri. Kathmandu Valley is part of three districts (Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur), has the highest population density in the country, and is home to about a twelfth of Nepal's population.\nHistorically, the Kathmandu Valley and adjoining areas were known as Nepal Mandala. Until the 15th century, Bhaktapur was its capital when two other capitals, Kathmandu and Lalitpur, were established. During the Rana and Shah eras, British historians called the valley \"Nepal Proper\". Today, Kathmandu is the capital of the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal, and also the headquarters of the Central Development Region of Nepal. The Central Region comprises three zones: Bagmati, Narayani, and Janakpur. Kathmandu is located in the Bagmati Zone.\nKathmandu is the gateway to tourism in Nepal. It is also the nerve center of the country's economy. It has the most advanced infrastructure of any urban area in Nepal, and its economy is focused on tourism, which accounted for 3.8% of Nepal's GDP in 1995\u201396. Tourism in Kathmandu declined thereafter during a period of political unrest, but since then has improved. In 2013, Kathmandu was ranked third among the top 10 travel destinations on the rise in the world by TripAdvisor, and ranked first in Asia.\nThe city has a rich history, spanning nearly 2000 years, as inferred from inscriptions found in the valley. Religious and cultural festivities form a major part of the lives of people residing in Kathmandu. Most of Kathmandu's people follow Hinduism and many others follow Buddhism. There are people of other religious beliefs as well, giving Kathmandu a cosmopolitan culture. Nepali is the most commonly spoken language in the city. English is understood by Kathmandu's educated residents.\nKathmandu's sister cities (Lalitpur Patan) and Bhaktapur are integral to Kathmandu's cultural heritage, tourism industry, and economy; therefore UNESCO's World Heritage Site lists all three cities' monuments and attractions together under one heading, \"Kathmandu Valley-UNESCO World Heritage Site\".\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nKathmandu Valley is in the Warm Temperate Zone of Nepal (elevation ranging from 1,200\u20132,300 metres (3,900\u20137,500 ft)), where the climate is fairly temperate, atypical for the region. This zone is followed by the Cool Temperate Zone with elevation varying between 2,100\u20133,300 metres (6,900\u201310,800 ft). Portions of the city with lower elevations have a humid subtropical climate, while portions of the city with higher elevations generally have a subtropical highland climate. In the Kathmandu Valley the average summer temperature varies from 28\u201330 \u00b0C (82\u201386 \u00b0F). The average winter temperature is 10.1 \u00b0C (50.2 \u00b0F).\nThe city generally has a climate with warm days followed by cool nights and mornings. Unpredictable weather is expected given temperatures can drop to 3 \u00b0C (37 \u00b0F) during the winter. During a 2013 cold front, the winter temperatures of Kathmandu dropped to \u22124 \u00b0C (25 \u00b0F), and the coldest temperature was recorded on January 10, 2013 at \u22129.2 \u00b0C (15.4 \u00b0F). Rainfall is mostly monsoon-based (about 65% of the total concentrated during the monsoon months of June to August), and decreases substantially (100 to 200 cm (39 to 79 in)) from eastern Nepal to western Nepal. Rainfall has been recorded at about 1,400 millimetres (55.1 in) for the Kathmandu valley, and averages 1,407 millimetres (55.4 in) for the city of Kathmandu. On average humidity is 75%.\n\n\n=== Tourist information ===\n1 Nepal Tourism Board, Exhibition Rd (Right next to Bhrikuti Mandap Park (Bhrikutimandi)), \u260f +977 1-4256909.

CIP Lounge (for business travellers, paying Rs 200 per person), two press rooms, cargo facilities, post office, souvenir shop, medical services, internet services   (updated Apr 2023) Tourist SIM cards are available at two counters, which are located between immigration and customs.\n\n\n==== International flights ====\nMost international flights to Kathmandu arrive from Delhi, UAE, Qatar, or Bangkok.\nInternational airlines serving Kathmandu include:\n\n\n==== Visa application process ====\nThere are three simple steps to apply for a visitor visa at the airport:\n\nUsing one of the flat screen monitors (located near the windows facing the immigration counters), type in personal details, operate camera for facial photograph, and scan passport. The system is a bit buggy, it asks you to fill in the LPC (Last Port of Call) and the phone number of your contact (e.g. hotel), but in the confirmation page these two fields will just display \"N/A\". However, you can click the \"Next\" button on the confirmation page to finish the application. You can avoid this procedure by applying for the visa online prior to boarding (https://nepaliport.immigration.gov.np/onlinevisa-mission/application). The accepted application is downloaded and shown at the cashier (see step two below) and immigration counters in either hard or soft copy format.\nTake the receipt (issued by the monitor) to the cashier and pay visa fees (convertible currencies only).\nAlong with passport, submit receipts from monitor and cashier at the immigration counter. The entire process usually does not take longer than ten minutes.\nVisa fees can be paid at the airport in most major currencies, with US dollars preferred.\nVisa on Arrival is free for citizens in certain countries. You still need to fill in the form in the flat screen monitor. After finishing the application form, you can take a screenshot of the application form with your mobile phone and show it to the immigration officer. \nDeparture cards are not provided on arrival but only when you leave Nepal. You will need your passport with your entry visa to complete the departure card.\nFor more general information on visas in Nepal see Nepal#Visas.\n\n\n==== Domestic flights ====\nCommercial domestic flights are available to/from Bhadrapur, Bhairawa, Bharatpur, Biratnagar, Dhangarhi, Janakpur, Nepalganj, Pokhara, Simara and Tumling Tar. Domestic flights take about an hour and cost US$100-175. The primary domestic airlines are air viva, Yeti, Nepal Airlines, and  Buddha Air. Domestic flights are almost always delayed and afternoon flights run the risk of cancellation as delays from the morning compound.\n\n\n==== Baggage safety, handlers and transport ====\nYour luggage is vulnerable entering and leaving this airport. Do not keep anything of value in checked bags, and if you lock the bag, the zip may be forced open and broken. There is little to no security for your bags. You should also be aware that most luggage is treated quite poorly in Nepalese airports. It is recommended that all fragile and valuable items are kept in your carry on luggage.\nOutside the airport, all \"representatives\" of the tourist industry are required to remain 10 m from the front door. Many will be waving large signs and yelling in an attempt to encourage you to choose them as your guide/taxi/hotel/luggage carrier. Make your choice before crossing the line. Be aware that as you leave the immigration section of the airport and collect your luggage, someone with a luggage trolley is very likely to approach and assist you. Unless you insist on handling your own bags and luggage trolley, this person will accompany you to the exit doors from the terminal and to your transportation and will then expect a tip. It's useful to have some small denomination bills or coins, even in a foreign currency, that you can use for a tip. Many visitors might arrive with only travellers cheques or large denomination bills, making tipping difficult.\n\n\n==== Money exchange at the airport ====\nTry not to exchange money at the airport as there are service charges and lower rates offered than what you can get in Thamel, which has many currency exchange booths where rates are competitive and the service is quick and efficient, or elsewhere in the city. If you want to get some cash before leaving the airport, it is better to cash out via ATMs, with better rates and usually faster than via those currency exchange shops. It is illegal to bring in Indian currency in 200- and 500-rupee bills and there is a risk of confiscation if you found doing so. \n\n\n==== Getting to and from the airport ====\nBy bus \u2013 Local buses pickup and drop-off at the airport gate, 0.5 km from the terminal. The buses generally do not have fixed schedules and are often crowded and painful but cost only Rs10. Ask the cashier about where the bus stops.\nBy taxi \u2013 Regular taxis are an easy way to get to the city but be prepared to negotiate the price beforehand. The rate to Thamel and Boudha is around Nrs650 and Nrs450 respectively, but it is difficult for foreigners to get that price at the airport, and so expect to pay at least another Nrs150\nBy prepaid taxi \u2013 Get your prepaid \"receipt\" at the airport (e.g. Nrs900 to Thamel or Boudha  before exiting the building. (However, you may get a cheaper fare if you are willing to negotiate outside.) Don't give the receipt to the driver until you are at your destination and you are satisfied, as this serves as the driver's payment. If the driver asks for more money, don't give it. Tipping taxi drivers is not expected.\nBy pre-arranged transfers \u2013 Available from most hotels and included in most trekking/touring packages. If possible, arrange your first night's accommodation before you arrive, since many hotel and guest houses offer complimentary airport transportation. Representatives will be standing outside the arrivals doors behind a barricade and will hold a sign identifying themselves. This form of transport is particularly helpful if you are a novice to Nepal, arriving late at night and unfamiliar with how things work in the country. However, some hotels may charge a higher price than prepaid taxi.\nThere are no trains in Kathmandu and renting a car without a driver is not possible.\nWhen you're leaving Nepal, it's a good idea to be aware if any strikes have been called and try to make arrangements. An early morning or evening trip to the airport may be a possible solution. Your hotel or trekking company may also be able to help.\n\n\n=== By bus ===\nFor more information, see Nepal 'Get in' section.\nThere is frequent and cheap bus service between Kathmandu and nearly all parts of Nepal. However, due to poor roads and frequent delays the buses are some of the slowest and least comfortable in South Asia.\n\n2 Balaju Bus Station (North Bus Station, Gongabu Bus Station), Dupchewsor Marga (There are 'mini buses' which criss-cross the main roads of the city for about Rs20). Buses using this bus station arrive from: India: Patna, Gorakhpur, Varanasi,  Lucknow. Nepal:  Pokhara and Chitwan \n3 Kalanki Station (AKA Swayambhu Bus Stand) (south) (There are mini buses which crisscross the main roads of the city for about Rs20.). Buses using this bus station arrive from: India: Delhi, Bodh Gaya, Patna, Gorakhpur, Varanasi, Lucknow, and Siliguri.  Nepal: Pokhara and Chitwan \n\n\n==== From Pokhara ====\nTourist buses (Rs800, 6-7 hr) and crowded local buses/microbuses (Rs400-600, 6-7 hr) travel the 200 km journey between Kathmandu and Pokhara almost every 15 minutes starting at 07:30 until late afternoon. Night buses are available, but the ride is painful. Greenline operates a convenient bus every morning between the popular tourist areas of Thamel in Kathmandu and Lakeside in Pokhara (US$20, lunch included). The road is winding and includes many hairpin bends and offers wonderful views of hills and rural Nepalese lifestyle. The drivers will generally not drive too fast, but some will calmly weave in and out of the stream of opposing traffic and brake heavily, making for a scary ride if you look out the front window. During the rainy season, there may be problems with the roads and flying may make more sense.\n\n\n==== From Tibet ====\nBuses and minivans run between Kathmandu and the Nepalese border town of Kodari, across the Sino-Nepal Friendship Bridge from the Tibetan city of Zhangmu. The 123-km journey takes at least 6 hours and costs Rs500. Buses depart until the early afternoon. Private jeeps (US$60 for up to 4 people) are a quicker option, and can make this journey in 4 hours. However, foreigners need special permits from government of PRC to travel in Tibet legally and must travel in groups arranged by travel agents. \n\n\n==== From India ====\nIndian bus from India terminate at the Swayambu Bus Stand\n\nDelhi - Numerous buses ply this route daily. The journey time is between 25 to 28 hours. Fare varies from between \u20b92,100- \u20b92,300\nSiliguri \u2014 Green Line operates a daily overnight A/C Volvo bus service from Siliguri (Tenzin Norgay Bus Station) , departing at 3PM and arriving at 8:30AM. \u20b92,000. The Nepal-Indian border at Siliguri is only open to Bhutanese, Indian, and Nepalese passport holders. (updated Nov 2024)\nSunauli \u2014 rickshaw to the Nepalese border city of Bhairahawa (ten minutes from Sunauli). Bus to Kathmandu (around 8-9 hours). Flight to Kathmandu (around 45 minutes)\n\n\n== Get around ==\nIf you fly in, be sure to pick up a free Kathmandu Valley map at the airport. The first thing some visitors notice about Kathmandu is the general lack of house numbers and street names except for major roads such as Tri Devi & Ring Road (loops around the city). In most cases directions are given relative to the nearest chowk or tole (an intersection or square, often with a market) or a noteworthy location or building (such as a temple or restaurant). In the tourist district of Thamel, the Kathmandu Guest House is the main landmark.\n\n2 Bagamati Tripureswor Bridge. Over Bagmati River \n3 Bagamati Bridge, Kupondole Rd. Over Bagmati River \n4 Bijeshwori Bridge (Bishnumati Dhalko Bhagawoti Bridge) (NW part of the city). Over Bishnumati River \n5 Bhimsen paakhaa Bishnumati Bridge, Bishnumati Track Rd.

Over Bishnumati River \n\n\n=== On foot ===\nIt is possible to get around Kathmandu by foot, but some may not always find the walking pleasant. It's worth considering, however, whether any form of public transport would be easier or more convenient than walking when you consider the crowds, the narrow streets and lanes, the traffic and everything you might want to see.\n\n\n=== By taxi ===\nTaxis can be hailed on the street or called through app. If you hail a taxi, negotiate the fare before starting off. Fares are higher after dark and in less busy areas. Taxis are easy to find; they park near all major streets & have fare-meters. After 22:00 it can be very difficult to find taxis away from central tourist areas or major hotels. It should be possible to hire a taxi from Thamel for Nrs500 one-way to Patan and around Nrs1,500 to Bakhtapur from Thamel or the airport. For longer trips and to hire a taxi by the day negotiate with the driver. Haggle hard and you will easily find another driver if you are not satisfied. The meter is your best bet if you are not confident enough to negotiate, however very few drivers will agree to using them. Sometimes the proper operation of meters can be suspect so if you know exactly where you're going, it might be better to negotiate a suitable price in advance.\nRide-hailing apps such as Pathao, and Tootle also work in Kathmandu and Pokhara. To use Pathao and Tootle, you need to have a Nepali mobile number, while inDrive supports international numbers. Sometimes the location displayed in inDrive is not correct and some drivers may keep waiting at the wrong spot displayed in inDrive and are reluctant to go to the right place based on third party map apps like Google Maps. Therefore, if the pick up point is not a famous landmark, it is recommended to make sure that the pickup point is displayed correctly in the inDrive app. If the pickup point is displayed incorrectly, it would be better to choose another place as the pickup point.\n\n\n=== By microbus ===\nThe Tempos, small three-wheeled buses, and microbuses are a very cheap (Nrs20-30) way to get around the city. The Tempos come in two varieties - green (electric) and blue (petrol) and run on predefined routes through the city. These routes are numbered, sometimes with both Nepali and European numerals. There does not seem to be a map of the routes, but you can get the hang of their paths quite quickly by asking and observing what numbers go on which road. Microbuses are typically minivans with a surprising number of seats crammed in - they have a \"conductor\" who leans out of the door and shouts the destinations, which are also often written on the front in Nepali. If you have time, you can ask if they are going your way and hop on. These also typically cost NRs20-30.\n\n\n=== By bus ===\n\nThere are also buses for longer trips within the valley, i.e. Patan, Bakhtapur, Boudha, etc. that can be used for trips in and around the city. See below for tips on travelling outside of the valley. Blue buses & green buses constantly drive in circles/loops around the city on the \"Ring Road\" - for Rs20 -30 depending on the distance. Every bus has a cashier/attendant who can tell you where it stops & alert you upon arrival. Riding the buses with the local people can be very pleasant & interesting. The buses are typically very old and rough.\n\n\n=== By motorbike taxi ===\nMotorbike taxis congregate at certain popular junctions or can be hailed through Tootle app. These are more expensive than buses or microbuses, but pick up and drop door to door.\n\n\n== See ==\nKathmandu has several excellent museums and galleries, which are mostly located in the central area of the city. The city is also home to a large number of Buddhist and Hindu temples, monasteries, and sacred sites. In particular, Boudha and Swayambu are famous for Buddhist monasteries, while Durbar Square is the center of Hindu culture.\n\n\n== Do ==\n\nKathmandu city itself has limited activities for visitors beyond the amazing sightseeing and general experience of being there.\n\n\n=== Flightseeing ===\nMountain Flights. Most local airlines offer one hour flights over the Himalayas departing 06:30-09:00 from Kathmandu airport, costing US$197. Book in advance during the popular tourist season.\n\n\n=== Connecting with locals ===\n Future Nepal, Kathmandu, \u260f +977 9849056230, contact@futurenepal.org.

(updated Mar 2017)\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\n\nKathmandu and Dubar Square is the centre for many of Nepal's festivals. Note that many businesses are closed for all of these holidays\u2014and often a few days before and after. Dasain in particular tend to shut down much of the city for October.\n\nDashain (Dasain) Dashain, the most important of Nepal's religious festivals takes place over fifteen days, between September and October each year. Dashain celebrates all of the manifestations of the goddess Durga, it is marked by animal sacrifices and feasting. It serves to renew family and community ties. Due to many residents of Kathmandu returning home to their villages during Dashain, the city takes on a more peaceful atmosphere.\nTihar, Festival of Lights (Also called Deepawali) A five-day festival which takes place each year on the fifteenth day of Kartika, around the end of October/start of November, celebrated by all Hindus with ritual house-cleaning, lanterns, candles, and fireworks. The Nepali version tends to be more picturesque and less explosive than those celebrated in India.\nHoli is celebrated in March with splashes of water and colored powder that is both good luck and very messy.\nBikram Sambat's New Year's (April) A day of pilgrimages (often from Kathmandu to the holy Bagamati river that separates it from Patan)\nTeej, the most important women's festival, is celebrated in September with married women dressed in their red marriage saris visiting male relatives and unmarried women and girls staying up all night to celebrate and pray for their future husbands.\nIndra Jatra Harvest festival held in Kathmandu's Dubar Square for 8 days each September. The  Goddess Kumari is paraded in her sacred chariot.\n\n\n=== Indigenous Festivals ===\nThe indigenous Newa population of Kathmandu have many festivals going on around the whole year.\n\nMohani Nakha, analogous to Dashain but celebrated by the Newar people.\nSakimana Punhi, celebrated on the full moon day of Kartik month (mid-October to mid-November) in Vikrami calendar.\nBala Chahre, also called Bala Chaturdashi, on the Chaturdashi day (the day prior to new moon (amavasya) or full moon (purnima)) of Magh month (mid-January to mid-February).\nYomari Punhi, a Newari festival marking the end of the rice harvest.\nDisi Chahre\nYenya Punhi\nLhuti Punhi\nSithi Nakha\nSasuma Puja\nSwonti Nakha\n\n\n== Learn ==\nThere are many courses available to tourists and long-term students in Kathmandu. In particular, Boudha is good for Buddhist studies, while Thamel is a centre for yoga and massage.\n\n\n=== Languages ===\nThe Bisho Bhasa Campus, (Campus of International Language) located at Exhibition Road, Kathmandu, offers Nepal Bhasa, Tibetan, Sanskrit and Nepali languages courses. You can find many local institutes that teach Nepal Bhasa, the indigenous language of Kathmandu.\n\n\n== Buy ==\nThere are many ATMs in Thamel; however, not all accept foreign cards. Most that do implement a charge of Rs650 per transaction; the only fee-free ATMs are (1) at the airport before immigration and (2) inside the gates of Kathmandu Guest House in Thamel. Standard Chartered Bank and Nabil Bank ATMs have the highest withdrawal limit, Rs35,000 per transaction. All shops will accept Nepali rupees and many will also accept $U.S. Indian rupees are also accepted.\nShopping malls are mostly found in the central area of the city, whereas Thamel is the home of bookshops. Traditional shops selling T-shirts, bags, and clothes are located between New Road and Chhetrapati, while shops selling religious items are mostly concentrated around Boudha.\n\nThanka Buddhist paintings - Thanka are traditional Buddhist paintings available all over Nepal. Prices and quality can vary a great deal. Good sellers will be able to describe the provenance, meaning and history of your chosen thanka. You may also be able to watch thanka being created at some galleries. For example, one gallery near the Boudnath Stupa often has thanka trainees at work so you can see the kind of detail that goes into each painting.\nStatues - Hand crafted statues from Nepal are famous all over the world, especially metal statues of god and goddess such as Buddha and Tara. You can easily find various statue shops in Thamel, although the statues are mainly manufactured in the Patan area. If you want to get closer to the source, Patan is a good place to buy such items. Be aware of items that might be antiques. The Nepalese government does not permit real antiques older than 100 years to leave the country, so if you are unsure of the age of the item you're interested in it is advisable to get it checked and certified by the Department of Archaeology to avoid problems on your departure.\nSilver - Jewellers from Bangkok come to Kathmandu to buy wholesale silver with Indian-processed semiprecious gemstones. The wholesale price of silver is published on the front page of the \"Himalayan\" newspaper (1 tola= 11.6 g) so buyers know the cost of the metal in piece, apart from the labor cost. Silver is almost invariably near the stamped \"92.5%\" sterling, as claimed.\nClothing - Kathmandu is a great place to shop for clothes or have existing clothes repaired or tailored. Flowing hippie gauzes, Monk's robes in saffrons and maroons, funky neon trance-wear, hemp clothing, dozens of elegant silks and 'suiting and shirting' are available in all qualities and prices. Tailors can be hired at reasonable fees and the quality of work is high. Handwoven Nepali fabrics cost Rs100-300/m and are available in endless patterns and colours. Anything, from bags to mountaineering equipment to cocktail dresses can be made to order and tailored to perfection. The alleys around Indra Chowk, between Thamel and Durbar Square, have dozens of fabric shops and tailors, much more dedicated to customer satisfaction than the hurried and expensive shops in Thamel. Bishal Bazaar near the corner of New Road and Durbar Square is a mall-like experience which also boasts several fabric shops and tailors. It is acceptable to buy fabric from one place and get it stitched in another. Expect to pay around Rs250 to stitch a Western-style men's/ladies' shirt. Feel free to take an existing item of clothing with you for the tailor to copy. Warning: if having clothes made to wear later at home, get measured before trekking if you want them to fit when you return to your normal size after your privations on the trekking trail!\nCarpets and rugs - Thamel has many carpet shops that have quality silk and wool carpets. Royal Collection (Shop 13, L.P. Jyoti Line) has a nice selection and good prices, after some aggressive price negotiations. Some places will charge a service fee on a purchase with a credit card, so make sure to clarify this during price negotiations.\nCultural Artifacts - Beware that there are lots of counterfeits, sly salesmen, and plastics presented as wood. Most real antiques are illegal to export. Genuine antiquities may have been looted from temples. Patan is known for the quality of bronzes. Read the book \"Shopping for Buddhas\" by Jeff Greenwald for more information.\nPashmina - Scarves and shawls can be purchased for a fraction of the price of those in Europe or North America. Look for those produced by charitable organisations such as the Tibetan refugee camp just outside Patan but be aware fakes are common and \"pashmina\" is not \"cashmere\".\nElectronics - Many people find Kathmandu a good place to buy a camera or other electronic device due to the lack of sales tax and import duty on electronics. There are shops in Thamel and around New Road.\n Bhat-Bhateni Supermarkets & Department Stores (many stores in Kathmandu), \u260f +977-1-4419181. (updated Jun 2019)\n\n\n=== Banks ===\nATMs often suffer from malfunctions and cash shortages, try to make withdrawals from ATMs attached to banks which are open.\n\n1 Bank of Asia, Saket Complex, Tripura Marg, (Tripureshwor Bus Stop). \n2 Century Commercial Bank, Hattisar Rd (Putali Sadak Bus Stop). \n3 Himalayan Bank, Karmachari Sanchaya Kosh Bldg, Tridevi Sadak. \n4 Nepal Bank Limited Central Office, Dharma Path, \u260f +977 1-4423375, corporate@nsbl.com.np. \n5 Nepal Rastra Bank, Central Office, Baluwatar, \u260f +977 1-4410158, +977 1 4410201, +977 1 4411250, +977 1 4419804, +977 1 4419805, +977 1 4419807, fax: +977 1 4410159. Banking Office (address:Thapathali) \n\n\n== Eat ==\n\nThe most important food in Kathmandu could be the indigenous Newa food. There are hundreds of traditional Newa delicacies, which can be found in bhatti (local restaurants) or cafes.\nThe most popular food in Kathmandu could be the momo, a dumpling which has its roots in Tibet and China. They are available fried or steamed and stuffed with buffalo, chicken, or veggies. Prices can vary depending on the location and what they are filled with, but expect to pay between Rs150-250 for a dozen. Kathmandu is also a good place to sample traditional Newari and Tibetan dishes.\nA Nepali set meal will usually include rice, daal, vegetable/meat curry, a vegetable dish, pickle (achar) and curd. Expect to pay around NPR140-280 at a tourist place, much less at local places. Chiya, a milky spiced tea similar to the Indian chai, is ubiquitous and good for a break to calm one's nerves.\n\nNote that most restaurants that cater to tourists will add a 10% service charge and then a 13% VAT charge (total of 24.5%) to the prices stated on the menu. These additional charges must be clearly stated on the menu.\nThere are dozens of tourist restaurants clustered in Thamel serving everything from Middle Eastern to Mexican food. Indian and Nepali dishes are always the most authentic and economically priced.\n\n\n== Drink ==\n\n\n=== Coffee ===\nIn recent times, coffee culture has made major inroads into Kathmandu and cafes offering espresso based coffees are no longer limited to tourist areas, but can be found throughout the city. Himalayan Java is a major player in the coffee world in Nepal, and their chic cafes are popular with tourists and locals alike.\n\n\n=== Alcohol ===\nThe indigenous Newa rice wine 'thon' and alcohol 'ayelaa' is available in local restro. Beer and mixed drinks are available at almost every bar and restaurant. For a quick drink and cheap cultural experience, try the local 'Nepali wine' (raksi) or 'Nepali Beer' (chang) neither of which taste anything like their namesakes. Gorkha Beer, Everest Beer, Nepal Ice, San Miguel, Carlsberg, and Tuborg beer are the principal conventional beers served in Kathmandu. Local beers tend to be more reliable than the imports.\n\n\n== Sleep ==\nCheck the \"district\" articles for accommodation listings in Kathmandu.\nVirtually all tourist accommodation is in Thamel, though there are some good deals to be had around Boudha. Upmarket hotels tend to be in central Kathmandu. There are also a few guest houses on Freak Street, which tend to be cheaper, though more tired looking than those in Thamel.\nYou can find many homestays in historical Newa towns, where you can live in a traditional Newa houses.\nRemember anyone on the street who takes you to a hotel will be receiving a commission from the hotel and that will be included in the price you pay. It is better to find a place on your own.\n\n\n== Stay safe ==\nCanadian Consular Affairs, the UK Foreign and Commonwealth office, and the US State Department provide travel advice. Nepal is safe to visit but caution must be taken. After the Maoists joined the government in about 2006, Nepal become relatively peaceful and more stable. However, visitors should avoid public demonstrations and may want to register with their consulate on arrival. Although tourists haven't been directly targeted by politically motivated violence, it is possible to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. The frequent strikes, locally known as bandh or banda, that are still held on occasion, are a major inconvenience for most tourists as all transportation stops, and many shops and restaurants close. In the 10-day period leading up to the Constituent Assembly Elections in November 2013.  During most of that time, very few public buses were operating so getting to the beginning of a trekking route immediately became very difficult.\nFollowing the news and government warnings is important. Be sure to check on current road conditions before leaving Kathmandu. As of April 2010, long-haul bus trips through the Eastern Terai were to be avoided as there was a risk of Maoist activity in this area.  That seems to have improved but there were problems before and after the elections in November 2013 that could indicate a return to some degree of instability.  Time will tell. There used to be reports of Maoists stopping buses and setting them alight, although allowing passengers to disembark first. Check daily newspapers for advance warning of planned strikes (bandh) when it may be better to stay away from the main roads in town.\nWhile in Kathmandu, always keep an eye on belongings. Violent crime is rare; pickpockets are not, especially in crowded places. If your hotel room door doesn't have a good lock or safe windows, store valuables on your person or in a hotel safety deposit box at all times. As with any large city, avoid walking alone in unlit areas.\nAvoid seeking help from random individuals on the streets who offer taking you to dance bars. There have been several cases of tourists ripped off once inside these dance bars.\n\n\n== Stay healthy ==\nAir quality in Kathmandu is very poor after the earthquake, particularly around the ring road. Buying a dust mask is advisable.\nWater in Kathmandu borders on being lethal, and water borne diseases are rife. Do not, under any circumstances, drink from taps or consume salads and ice unless you are confident that the water used in their preparation has been filtered and boiled. Also, use boiled and filtered water for brushing teeth and avoid swallowing water when taking a shower. Circumstances may differ in private houses and the better hotels in Kathmandu.  More concerning there have been a number of instances of bottled water companies not meeting minimum safety standards, purchase water in larger shops.  Large gallon bottles of water are used in most local restaurants but there is no guarantee they haven't been re-filled.\nFood can be contaminated and some people suggest that you should eat only at larger restaurants. Counterfeit and out of date food and cigarettes are very common in local shops, check use-by dates before purchasing products.\nHomemade Alcohol (chang, roxi, three panni roxi, toongba) may contain methanol and is not recommended, drinking large amounts would be extremely unwise.\nVaccinations for rabies, tetanus, typhoid, and hepatitis are recommended prior to arriving in Kathmandu, and can take several months to complete. Tropical diseases such as Japanese encephalitis should be vaccinated against if you plan to travel outside of the Kathmandu Valley, towards the lowlands in the Terai. You may wish to take a malarial prophylaxis. See Immunization advice for Nepal\nAnimals, such as bats and monkeys (including those at Swayambhunath), may be carriers of rabies and other diseases. Even if you've had the foresight to be vaccinated for rabies prior arrival, treatment following possible exposure is still necessary to prevent infection. If you are bitten, you should go to a clinic immediately for treatment. No cases of avian influenza have been documented in Nepal, but it has been confirmed in nearby countries.

        "title": "Venice",
        "extract": "Venice (Italian: Venezia; Venetian: Venexia) is a sanctuary on a lagoon that is virtually the same as it was 600 years ago, which adds to the fascinating character. Venice has decayed since its heyday and suffers from overtourism, but the romantic charm remains. It is also known as the birthplace of composers Tomaso Albinoni and Antonio Vivaldi, and of the poets and opera librettists Apostolo Zeno and Carlo Goldoni. Venice and its lagoon are a UNESCO World Heritage site. It used to be an independent republic, and remains one of Italy's most important cities, with a quarter million inhabitants. Venice is also known as the home of the world's first international film festival, founded in 1932.\n\n\n== Districts ==\n\nMany visitors also pay a visit to Mestre (mainland Venice) and some of the neighboring islands in Metropolitan Venice during their stay.\n\nBurano \u2014 Popular with artists and known for its many small, brightly painted houses.\nMurano \u2014 Filled with quaint shops and restaurants, Murano is known far and wide for its high quality glass making.\nLido \u2014 Venice's long skinny beach, Lido offers a respite from more touristy and expensive areas.\nTorcello \u2014 Sparsely populated and accessible by vaporetto, this island offers a unique window into Venetian life.\n\n\n== Understand ==\n\n\n=== Orientation ===\nMetropolitan Venice has nearly a million inhabitants, and includes coastal and inland towns such as Bibione, Chioggia and Eraclea.\nThe comune (municipality) of Venice lies at the coast of northern Italy. It is made up of many islands in the Venetian Lagoon and a stretch of terraferma (mainland). The comune is divided into six boroughs, the most famous of which (known as Venezia Insulare) comprises the historic city of Venice as well as the islands of Giudecca, Murano, Burano, Torcello, Mazzorbo and Sant'Erasmo. Lido and Mestre are other popular areas of the comune.\nThe historic city is divided into six sestieri (districts): Cannaregio, Castello, Dorsoduro, San Polo, Santa Croce and finally San Marco, where the main monuments and sights are. Each sestiere uses separate house numbers, however they are not allocated in a specific pattern.\n\n\n=== History ===\nSee also: Medieval and Renaissance Italy, Marco Polo\nThe Most Serene Republic of Venice dates back to 827, when a Byzantine Duke moved its seat to what is now known as the Rialto, and for the following 970 years, it prospered on trade (especially from the Silk Road) and under the rule of a Roman-style Senate headed by the Doge. Eventually, the Republic of Venice grew into a powerful city-state, and the cradle of Italian Renaissance. In the late 15th century, the Ottoman Empire's expansion around the Mediterranean, new routes on the high seas shifted commerce to the Atlantic, demoting Venice's political status.\nThe city remains a centre for the arts. One of the significant events in the history of Venice was the opening of the first public opera house in 1637, which allowed members of the general public (those who could afford to pay for the tickets) to enjoy what was once court entertainment reserved for the aristocracy, thus allowing the genre of opera to flourish. Venice was an important destination of the Grand Tour from the 17th century. In 1797, the city was conquered by Napoleon, a blow from which it never recovered. The city was soon absorbed into Austria-Hungary, then ping-ponged back and forth between Austria and a nascent Italy, but Venice is still a monument to the glory days of the Renaissance, and historical culture still throbs powerfully in the old Italians' veins.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nVenice has a humid-subtropical climate with hot summers and cool winters. For those who don't enjoy the heat, July and August may be the worst time to visit: it's sometimes very hot and often humid, there are mosquitoes and occasional infestations of flies, and there are a lot of tourists and large crowds. Mid to late spring and early to mid autumn are probably best, a compromise between temperature (expect 10-25\u00b0C) and the tourist load. Between November and January, you may manage to feel you have Venice all to yourself, an interesting experience. Beware of the weather during the winter months: it can be quite chilly, windy, and damp. Fog is an additional hazard if you are driving in or out, doubly so in the unlikely chance that you will pilot a boat. But if you've never been to Venice, it's better to go in summer than not to go. You won't regret it. Many cities are far worse in summer. Although Venice has no cars, diesel motors used by boats contribute to less than stellar air quality.\nAcqua alta (high water) has become a fact of life in Venice. The lagoon water level occasionally rises above the level of the squares and streets, flooding them. This can happen several times a year, at irregular intervals, usually in the colder months. Acqua alta usually lasts a few hours and coincides with high tide. You'll see raised walkways in side alleys ready to be pulled out when acqua alta hits. When the city begins to flood, sirens will sound to warn residents and businesses. If you speak fluent Italian, tune into news programs since their predictions of the times the flood begins and ends are usually accurate. Normally, the tide rises and falls in six-hour cycles.\nYou can get an acqua alta map at the tourist offices either at the railway station or St Mark's Square. This will show you the higher, dry routes and the ones with walkways set up during the various flood alerts. There is a tide measuring station at the Rialto vaporetto piers, and a noticeboard at the base of the Campanile in the Piazza San Marco that shows a live tide reading and predictions for the next few days.\n\n\n=== Tourist information ===\nVenice tourism website\n\n\n== Get in ==\n\nWater plays a crucial role in transportation, as Venice is on a lagoon. Whichever way you arrive, the last part of your journey will be on foot from the nearest waterbus/watertaxi jetty. Bear this in mind when choosing your hotel location and route to it, especially if you need to carry bags along the narrow streets. (The sound of hard suitcase wheels on cobblestones is annoying, and they can damage marble steps.)  A lot of the higher priced hotels will offer complementary water boat transfers from the airport. \n\n\n=== By plane ===\nMarco Polo Airport and Treviso Airport serve the city. If no flight suits you, check flying to nearby Bologna or Verona. From both cities trains and buses depart to Venice.\n\n\n==== Marco Polo Airport ====\n1 Marco Polo Airport (VCE IATA) (on the mainland near Mestre, a more typical Italian city without Venice's unique structure). This is the closest commercial airport.

In Mestre, tickets can be bought at ATVO ticket office in Via Capuccina 183, near the railway station (\u260f +39 421 594 673), at automatic ticket machine outside the ticket office, at Bar Binario, situated near the ticket office, at ATAV - Associazione Turistica Albergatori Venezia, inside the railway station or at 365 Grandi Biglietterie Agency inside the railway station.\nACTV operates urban aerobus 5 service between Piazzale Roma and Marco Polo Airport every day, all day except for a few hours overnight from about 01:00 to 04:00. The trip in a city bus takes about 23 minutes. The ACTV ticket price to or from the airport premises is \u20ac10 one-way and \u20ac18 return for a 75-minute trip by bus and/or water buses (vaporetti). One piece of hand luggage is included in the price. If you are willing to walk 1 km to save some euros, walk to the 1 Triestina Tessera stop and catch the same bus 5 (or some other routes) for \u20ac1.50. The buses now have a tap-to-pay option for contactless credit cards or there is an AVM Venezia app to buy tickets: the ticket purchase option is confusingly labeled under \"Transport\" - \"Ticket Office\" - \"Automotive\" and the ticket must be activated before boarding the bus. \nAlilaguna operates three water bus lines from the airport. Such a direct water bus from the airport may be more convenient than taking the bus to the bus station and then changing to the local water bus. To reach the boat jetty, turn left on leaving the terminal and walk 10 minutes along the covered walkway.\n\nBlue line (linea blu) runs from the airport to the Cruise Terminal (Terminal Crociere) via Murano, Fondamente Nove, Ospedale, Bacini, Lido, Arsenale, San Zaccaria, San Marco, Zitelle, Zattere, and Giudecca Stucky.

All tickets can be purchased online. The water bus services from the airport are operated by a different company (Alilaguna) than the other public water bus services in Venice, so separate tickets will be required.\nFrom the same jetty, you can travel in style (and much faster) by hiring one of the speedy water-taxis (30 min) for about \u20ac110.\n\n\n==== Treviso Airport ====\nThe Treviso Airport (TSF IATA), located 25 km (16 mi) from Venice near Treviso, is relatively smaller but becoming increasingly busy as the main destination for Ryanair, Wizzair, and Transavia budget flights.

If you arrive at the airport and the line is moving too slowly, you can purchase local fast track service at UFirst.com for \u20ac10. This is official but poorly advertised at the airport. There is no express passport control if departing the Schengen area.\nATVO operates buses from Venice to Treviso Airport daily at 05:30, 07:10, 10:30, and 18:30 and from Treviso Airport to Venice daily at 07:45, 08:15, 13:10 and 21:20 plus others not connecting to the flights to and from Treviso Airport.

The ticket price is \u20ac3.95 for the train.\n\n\n==== San Nicolo Airport ====\nThe San Nicolo Airport (ICAO: LIPV, no IATA code) is an airfield directly on the Lido. It handles only small aircraft, as the runway (grass) is about 1 km long, and does not have any scheduled flights, but might be of interest to private pilots (arrivals from Schengen Agreement states only) due to its convenience to the city (it is a short walk to the vaporetto landing).\n\n\n=== By train ===\n\nVenice is well-connected with the domestic train network, Rome and Milan are only a few hours away. Also there are some night trains from cities in southern Italy, though since 2012 most services have been canceled. Freccia Bianca (White Arrow) trains to Trieste leave from Venezia Mestre at 10:24, 19:45 and 21:59 and the trip takes about 1 hr 35 min. Regionale Veloce (Fast Regional) trains leave from Santa Lucia station at 09:11, 09:48, 12:09, 13:09, every hour from 14:11 to 18:11, at 19:35, the trip taking about 2 hr 5 min.

There are departures at least once a week between March and November. As one of the most sumptuous journeys in the world, the trip is expectedly very expensive, starting at \u20ac2,900.\nTrains from the mainland run through Mestre on the mainland to the terminus Venezia Santa Lucia railway station on the west side of Venice; make sure you don't get it confused with the two stations on the mainland before the bridge. Many through trains only stop in Mestre, in that case just hop on to one of the very frequent trains to Santa Lucia (ticket \u20ac1.25). Also, ACTV has a ticket office at Mestre station, and queues might be shorter here. From the Santa Lucia station district, water buses (vaporetti) or water taxis can take you to hotels or other locations on the islands, but walking is usually the best option.\n\n2 Venezia Santa Lucia railway station (Stazione di Venezia Santa Lucia), Fondamenta Santa Lucia (Northern edge of Cannaregio district). The main terminus station located in proper Venice. The strikingly modern building was built in 1934. Stepping out from the station you are immediately met with views of the canals and historic Venice. The station itself has plenty of amenities, including lounges for holders of first-class tickets.

(updated Mar 2021)\n4 Venezia Porto Marghera railway station (Stazione di Venezia Porto Marghera). Smaller station on the mainland, only local services call here.   (updated Mar 2021)\n\n\n=== By car ===\nDistances to Venice: Rome 540 km, Milan 279 km, Padua 60 km, Vicenza 75 km, Udine 125 km\nCars arrive on the far western edge of Venice, but remain parked at the entrance to the city (Piazzale Roma or Tronchetto, which is Europe's largest car park.) There are no roads past this point, and never were, even before cars.\n\n\n==== Parking ====\nCar parking is very very expensive here (\u20ac26/12 hr, \u20ac30/24 hr) and the tailbacks can be quite large. Tronchetto is about a 1 km from Piazzale Roma, the city's main entry point, but there is a shuttle train service, People Mover, at \u20ac1.50.\n\n5 Parking Tronchetto, Isola Nuova del Tronchetto, \u260f +39 041 5207555, fax: +39 041 5285750, info-tronchettopark@interparking.com.

Zaccaria. \n\n\n==== Car rental ====\nMost of the major rental car companies have outlets at Piazzale Roma, at the edge of the city. These are on the ground floor of one of the major parking stations. When you are dropping off your car, you need to find street parking and then walk to the rental car outlet and hand in the keys. Do not park in the parking station. There is a vaporetto stop across the road from the parking station.\n\n\n=== By bus ===\nFor bus services between Marco Polo airport (VCE) and the Piazzale Roma bus station in Venice, see the By Place section.

There are porter stations at Ferrovia \u260f +39 041 715272, Piazzale Roma \u260f +39 041 5223590, S.Marco Campo della Guerra \u260f +39 3478675491, S.Marco Calle Vallaresso \u260f +39 3465881508, S.Marco Bacino Orseolo \u260f +39 3282696025, S.Marco Sant'Angelo \u260f +39 3406382287, S.Zaccaria (Danieli) \u260f +39 3203385248, S.Zaccaria (Jolanda) \u260f +39 3495803239 and Rialto (Imbarcadero Actv Rialto line 1 and 2) \u260f +39 3474348898.\n\n\n== Get around ==\nVenice, the world's only pedestrian city, is easily walkable, and the absence of cars makes this a particularly pleasant experience. However, walking and standing all day can also be exhausting, so it is best to pace yourself. The Rialtine islands \u2013 the 'main' part of Venice \u2013 are small enough to walk from one end to the other in about an hour, provided you don't get lost (a common occurrence).\nIf you want to get around a bit more quickly, there are numerous vaporetti (water buses) and water taxis. The vaporetti are generally the best way to get around, even if the service route map changes frequently. If you are going to be in Venice for a few days visiting, it is a lot cheaper to use vaporetti than private water taxis. If you want to have a romantic ride along the canals, take a gondola ride, although they tend to exist for more scenic purposes, rather than getting people from point A to point B.\nGPS navigation services such as Google Maps are notoriously unreliable in Venice. The density of stone buildings makes it fairly difficult to receive a proper GPS satellite signal. You can mitigate some of these navigation issues using the Live View function in Google Maps, which uses your camera to orient yourself relative to businesses and landmarks around you. However, as of February,2024, Google Maps has been reported as to be working well for pathway navigation.\nThe one surprising way you can't get around in Venice is by bicycle. Bicycles are banned in the main city. You are allowed to carry your bike in your arms (not ride, not wheel/walk) from the pIazzale Roma to the Venezia Santa Lucia train station, and if you are traveling through Venice to reach Lido or Pellestrina, then you can carry a bicycle like any other large package on public transit. There is a \u20ac100 fine for riding a bicycle in Venice.\n\n\n=== By public transport ===\nACTV runs the vaporetti and other public transport services in the lagoon and on land.\n\nLine 1 runs from Piazzale Roma to Lido, passing the Railway Station (Ferrovia), Canal Grande, Rialto, S.Marco and S.Zaccaria and vice versa, leaving Piazzale Roma every 20 minutes from 05:01 to 06:01 and from 22:21 to 23:41, every 10 minutes from 06:21 to 22:01, leaving Lido every 20 minutes from 04:16 to 05:36 and from 21:46 to 23:06, every 10 minutes from 5:56 to 21:26. Notice that this service can be very crowded during the day as it passes through many sights along the Grand Canal.\nLine N is a night line, connecting Lido with Canal Grande, Piazzale Roma, Tronchetto, Canale and vice versa. Boats leave Lido every 20 minutes from 23:26 to 04:06 and Piazzale Roma every 20 minutes from 00:09 to 04:49.\nLine 2 goes from S.Zaccaria over S.Giorgio, Giudecca, Zattere, Tronchetto, Piazzale Roma, Ferrovia, S.Marcuola, Rialto, S.Tom\u00e0, S.Samuele, Academia and S.Marco. Departure from S.Zaccaria every 20 minutes from 04:59 to 08:39 and from 20:49 to 23:09, every 10 minutes from 08:59 to 20:29.

Information for all ACTV services at Hello Venezia \u260f +39 041 2424, daily 07:30 to 20:00. You can download a map of Venice water buses\nA single ticket (biglietto solo andata) costs \u20ac9.50, permitting the use of public transports for 75 minutes from the moment you validate the ticket including transfers heading in the same direction. If you board a boat without having bought a ticket, you have to buy one from the on-board collector. There are no return tickets.\nThere are tourist travel cards (biglietto turistico a tempo) that cost \u20ac25 for 24 hours, \u20ac35 for 48 hours, \u20ac45 for 72 hours and \u20ac65 for 7 days. There are other versions available, including those offering discounts for youth under 29 year of age. Current rates can be found here.\nSomething you won't be told easily is that now anyone can purchase the Venezia Unica City Pass card (formerly IMOB) - the only difference is that in addition to its \u20ac10 cost for residents, foreigners need to pay a \u20ac90 extra \"transport activation\" fee. Unless you are in town for a couple of days and planning never to return, do it. It's a durable plastic card with your (webcam) picture, and once you have it, you are more or less a local - which means access to \u20ac1.50 single vaporetto tickets (save even more by recharging the card with 10 at once for \u20ac14), half-price discount on Alilaguna services, and even \u20ac0.70 traghetto crossings (instead of \u20ac2; flash the card to the gondolier). It is valid for 5 years from the month of issue. Register at the Venezia Unica site and pre-fill the application online, then go to one of the ACTV offices (not simply ticket points; probably the easiest location is at Piazzale Roma) and tell the clerk that you have a \"contratto precompilato\" - they'll pull it up, ask you to sign the privacy disclosures and issue the card on the spot (or you can fill the form at the counter; bear in mind it's in Italian). Moreover, if you happen to have a +39 Italian cell phone number, with it and your new Unica you can get a free code for use of the communal WiFi spots. If you lose the card, do not despair: it costs only \u20ac10 to get an immediate replacement, and the balance (along with your old photograph) is automatically transferred over.\nThe Venice Connected website of the Comune di Venezia (now integrated into Unica site) makes possible to book online (at least 7 days in advance) most services controlled by the town administration (public transportation, access to the civic museums, access to public restrooms, car park tickets, entrance to the Casin\u00f2 and access to the municipal WiFi network covering the entire historic centre); the online prices vary according to the projected number of visitors but are always cheaper than the current on-site prices (and cheaper than with a Venice Card).\nYou can also get a Venice Card, which has various options that you can choose when you buy it (public transportation, cultural attractions, toilet access, Alilaguna, etc.) There is a 'Junior' version of the Venice that is available at a slightly reduced rate for those between 5 and 29 years of age. A Venice Card is not recommended for those with less than 3 days in Venice, as most of the top attractions are not included in the Venice Card. If you'll be staying in Venice for a week - get the Venice Card and enjoy travelling from island to island and exploring the various museums and churches it offers access to.\nMaps are available at the vaporetto stops in the ticket booths. The map is quite reliable, and is free when getting a Venice Card (\u20ac2 otherwise) can be viewed on Internet.\nVenice Cards can be reserved on-line  for a considerable discount. There are long lines when taking the Venice Card from the ticket booths. The Venezia St. Lucia ticket booth that offers Venice Cards is the one most on the right when you exit the train station.\nVenice vaporetto tickets can be also purchased online on many websites such as ElMoro.com that presents all the the vaporetto's lines and information to get around by boat.\n\n\n=== By foot ===\n\nOtherwise, take a walk!  The city is not that big, and you can walk from one end to the other in a few hours if you stick to the paths conveniently marked with arrows in the direction of major landmarks. But it would take months for a fit person to discover every path in the city. Make sure to visit some of the smaller alleyways, as they can be very interesting. Along the way you will discover marvelous art, superb architecture and breathtaking urban landscaping. Exploring the city randomly by walking is well worth it, but also be prepared to get lost easily! Signs all over the city indicate the direction to the main attractions, \"Rialto\" and \"San Marco\", as well as the way back to the train station (\"ferrovia\") and the bus terminal (\"Piazzale Roma\"). These signs make it easy to have the \"get lost experience\" even as a one-day tourist. For a faster and safer walk, you should walk on the right side of every path.\nBe aware that addresses in Venice are of the form \"District Number\" (the Venetian word for district is \"Sestiere\"), not \"Street Number\". To find a specific place using a map, make sure you know which district it is in. The numbers are assigned at the start of the district and increase as they move farther away from the Grand Canal.\nTravellers with mobility impairments will need to plan their routes carefully and allow extra time. Although the city is nearly flat, moving from one section to another requires either getting on a boat or climbing stairs to cross a bridge. The water buses are generally wheelchair accessible, though a wheelchair user may not be able to board when they are crowded. A few bridges have temporary ramps, and the city plans to add permanent ramps to a few more. This should, hopefully by 2030, allow people to move between the most popular attractions in the city without climbing stairs, although some areas of the city will remain difficult to access.\n\n\n=== By water taxi ===\n\nWater taxis (taxi acquei) are operated by Coop. San Marco (\u260f +39 041 5222303), Coop. Veneziana (\u260f +39 041 716124), Coop. Serenissima (\u260f +39 041 5221265 or \u260f +39 041 5229538), Soc. Narduzzi Solemar (\u260f +39 041 5200838), Soc.

There are supplements of \u20ac5 for call services and customer pick-up outside the taxi ranks, of \u20ac10 for night services between 22:00 and 06:00, of \u20ac3 pieces of luggage exceeding 4 pieces and of \u20ac5 or \u20ac10 for every person exceeding a group of 4. Rates are fixed by a resolution of the Venice City Council.\nA water taxi service for persons with special needs is available at \u260f +39 041 2747332 or directly through the website Book Taxi Venice.\n\n\n=== By taxi ===\n'Normal' taxis can be called from Radio Taxi (\u260f +39 041 936137). There are taxi ranks at Piazzale Roma (\u260f +39 041 5237774) and Lido (\u260f +39 041 5265974).\n\n\n=== By traghetto ===\nThere are small gondola ferries crossing the Canal Grande at\n\n11 S.Sofia, M\u2013Sa 07:30\u201320:00, Su and holidays 08:45\u201319:00\n12 Carbon (Rialto), M\u2013F 07:00\u201312:30, weekdays only\n13 S.Tom\u00e1, M\u2013Sa 07:30\u201320:00, Su and holidays 08:30\u201319:30\n14 San Barnaba, M\u2013F 07:45\u201312:30,\n15 S.Maria del Giglio, daily 09:00\u201318:00\n16 Dogana, daily 09:00\u201314:00\nTicket price \u20ac2 one way, \u20ac0.70 for Venice residents and IMOB card holders.\n\n\n=== By tour ===\nAlilaguna Green line (linea verde)\nAlilaguna, \u260f +39 041 5235775, operates a 4 hours excursion tour to the island of Murano, Burano and Torcello with explanations in English, French, German and Spanish.

Ticket price \u20ac20 (free for holders of Alilaguna 72-hr pass).\n\n\n== See ==\n\nVenice is packed full of sights, with something interesting to see around each corner. The most spectacular sights, such as the Doge's Palace and Saint Mark's Basilica, are in San Marco, the historic seat of power.\n\n1 Doge's Palace (Palazzo Ducale), Piazetta San Marco, San Marco 1 (vaporetto line 1 or 2 to San Marco), \u260f +39 041 2715911.

Don't miss the guided tour named Secret Itinerary, which will let you discover the part of the palace where the city's administration worked, as well as Casanova's jail and the wonderful 500-year-old roof structure. A MUVE museum. Adults \u20ac20, reduced \u20ac14.   \n2 Bell tower of St. Mark (Campanile di San Marco), Piazza San Marco, San Marco (vaporetto line 1 to San Marco), \u260f +39 041 5224064. Nov-Mar: 09:30-15:45; Apr-Jun, Oct: 09:00-19:00; Jul-Aug: 09:00-21:00. The current tower dates from 1912; an exact replica of the previous tower which collapsed in 1902. The top of the tower offers great views of Venice and the lagoon. \u20ac8.   \n3 Clock tower (Torre dell'Orologio), Piazza San Marco, San Marco (vaporetto lines 1-2-5, 1.5.2 to San Marco), \u260f +39 041 5209070. Having been closed for restoration for many years, the restored astronomical clock is now visible. The fascinating tour of the clock mechanism (and rooftop bell) can only be visited on a guided tour, in English: M-W at 10:00 and 11:00, on other days at 14:00 and 15:00, in French M-W at 14:00 and 15:00, advance reservation required online or by phone at +39 041 5209070. A MUVE museum. Adults \u20ac12, reduced \u20ac7.   \n4 Scuola Grande di San Rocco, San Polo 3052 (vaporetto line 1 or 2 to San Tom\u00e0, near the Basilica di Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari), \u260f +39 041 5234864. Daily 09:30-17:30, closed Dec 25, Jan 1, Easter Sunday. A masterpiece of Tintoretto, this guild house is an exquisite example of Mannerist art at its best. In order to allow a comfortable admiration of the detailed ceiling, mirrors are offered to the visitors. Cycles of allegories, life and passion of Christ, scenes from the Old and New Testament. Adult \u20ac10, concessions \u20ac8.   \n5 Jewish Ghetto of Venice (Ghetto Ebraico di Venezia), Cannaregio. While racial and ethnic neighborhoods had existed prior to the Venetian Ghetto, Venice's ghetto was the first \"ghetto\" (coming from a Venetian word for the Iron Foundry that was on the site previously) and \"ghetto\" eventually came to mean any neighborhood that was made up of a single ethnic or racial group. Today, Jewish life is still very active in the ghetto, and elsewhere in Venice, and is home to five synagogues. Visiting on Saturdays or late Fridays (the Jewish Sabbath) will prove very fruitless because all shops, restaurants, and other Jewish places will be closed. \n6 Ponte di Rialto (Rialto Bridge) (connecting sestieri San Polo and San Marco across Canal Grande). The bridge has become one of Venice's most recognizable icons and has a history that spans over 800 years. Today's Rialto Bridge was completed in 1591 and was used to replace a wooden bridge that collapsed in 1524.   \n7 Zattere, Dorsoduro. It's a long and sunny walk along the Giudecca canal, protected during winter time from cold northerly winds for being exposed to south and shielded by buildings. You might find interesting to see how a gondola is made, stopping by the Squero (Venetian for small ship yard) across the canal near San Trovaso Church. It's one of the few still in business in town. With some luck, you'll see some gondole through various manufacturing steps (note that gondole are not straight to counterbalance the gondoliere push). \n\n\n=== Churches ===\n\nA lot of churches will charge an entry fee. This is true of the Basilica di San Marco. There is a \"Chorus Pass\" for entry into some churches, but be aware there is a limited selection of churches this applies to. If you plan to visit three churches or more, you are better off buying the churches pass. There is also a combined pass for museums, churches and transportation only available at the tourist information office but it is relatively expensive.\n\n8 Saint Mark's Basilica (Basilica di San Marco), Piazza San Marco, San Marco 328 (water lines #1, 52, and 82 will take you from Santa Lucia (the train station) or Piazzale Roma to Piazza San Marco. Walking is another option but will require a map and lots of time and energy), \u260f +39 041 5225205 (procuratorial phone number). Oct-Mar: 09:45-16:45; Apr-Sep: 09:45-17:00. Saint Mark's Basilica is on the Piazza San Marco and is one of the highlights of a visit to Venice. As with most churches in Italy, you must be dressed appropriately to be allowed in; this means no short skirts or bare shoulders. You are not allowed to carry large bags or rucksacks inside, sometimes even small daypacks may need to be deposited. Storage is available just around the corner from the main entrance (free of charge). Filming and photography is forbidden so be prepared in advance. The visit within the basilica lasts ten minutes. Waiting for entry into the basilica can last up to five or so hours and it may be wise to use a ticket service to reserve your visit (reservation costs \u20ac3). Once you have a reservation you can take the group entrance on the left, where you hand in the printout of your reservation. As of April 2022 there is a small charge for admission to the basilica. Do note there are extra charges for the high altar and the museum. The museum entry is worth paying for as it allows you access to the balcony overlooking the Piazza San Marco; do note that museum access may be difficult if you have mobility issues..   (updated Nov 2021)\n9 San Giacomo di Rialto, San Polo. This church, built around 421, is possibly the oldest in Venice. It is most recognized for its 15th-century clock above the entrance. It is also recognized for the red pillars and beautiful gold accents around the church.   \n10 San Giovanni e Paolo (San Zanipolo), Castello. A fine, huge Dominican church with the tombs of many Doges. It shares its piazza with the fine Renaissance fa\u00e7ade of the Scuola San Marco and an equestrian statue of the mercenary (condottiere) captain Bartolomeo Colleoni. Look out for the testicles (coglioni in Italian - it's a lousy pun) on his coat of arms!   \n11 Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari (Basilica dei Frai, often just referred to as the Frari), San Polo 3072, \u260f +39 041 2728618.

A perfect jewel box church, simple in form but ornamented with fine exterior marble facings.   \n13 San Simeone Piccolo, Santa Croce (located opposite the Santa Lucia train station across the Canal Grande). The last church built in Venice. One of the things that it is recognized for is the fact that they celebrate Tridentine Mass on Sundays.

Two events organised by Biennale are the Art and Architecture International Exhibitions happening alternately (Architecture Biennale in even years, Art Biennale in odd) but other fields are also covered - contemporary theatre, dance, music, cinema (Venice International Film Festival). Exhibitions take place mostly in two locations: 1 Arsenale and 2 Giardini. They are both worth visiting even when no event is scheduled. Arsenale is the largest pre-industrial production centre in the world, dating back to 13th century, and Giardini is architectural gem filled with national pavilions from different parts of the world, often designed by famous architects, it was a venue for the International Art Exhibition since the 19th century.\n Art Biennale (Esposizione internazionale d\u2019arte): April \u2013  November 2024, \u260f +39 041 5218711, aav@labiennale.org.  It is held at Arsenale (vaporetto line 4.1 and 4.2 to Arsenale) and Giardini (vaporetto line 4.1 and 4.2 to Giardini). The Central Pavillion and the pavilions of Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brasil, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Egypt, Finland, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Hungary, Israel, Japan, Korea, The Netherlands, Nordic Countries, Poland, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovak Republic, Spain, Switzerland, United States, Uruguay, Venezuela and the pavilion of Venice are located in the Giardini. The Biennale is open every second year from April to November, Tu-Su 10:00-18:00. Admission for 219 was \u20ac30 for two days, multiple entries (ID required); \u20ac25 one day, single entry to each venue; \u20ac20 over 65, \u20ac14 students. There are many other exhibitions (collateral events) all over the city, often permitting to visit buildings which normally are not open to the public. Online guides to the exhibits are not substantive. The British Council provides a comprehensive guide to all exhibits available at the British pavilion at the Giardini. The Concordia/Antarctic Exhibition has closed early. (date needs updating)\n3 Carnival of Venice (Carnevale di Venezia). Annual festival that is world famous for the carnival masks.   \n Regata Storica (Historic fleet event): , \u260f +39 041 2424, vela@velaspa.com.  Celebrating a historic event from 1489, the regatta displays almost a hundred varieties of Venetian boats from the city's rich past. Large oarships, replicating ancient roman and medieval vessels, are rowed along the Canal Grande, followed by many smaller boats. There are several races, including a master championship for solo sculling in streamlined gondolini, painted in unusual white, pink, etc. colours. There are many excellent photo opportunities for this event. Early September. (date needs fixing)\n Vogalonga: 2, \u260f +39 041 5210544, fax: +39 041 5200771, info@vogalonga.com.  The yearly equivalent of a marathon run on water. Vogalonga competitors must row 32 km under 3\u00bd hours to receive a certificate of attendance at the finish line, but everybody with a human-powered vessel is welcome to participate (some foreigner teams take up to 10 hours to complete the journey just for the fun of it). The official purpose of the Vogalonga was to protest the sharply increasing use of powerboats in Venice, but the event has gradually grown into a festival since 1974, with up to 5500 racers in 1500 vessels attending by the early 2000s. The racetrack visits different parts of Venice as well as some of the nearby islands. Locals and tourists lining up alongside rios and canals cheer the racers. Visitors wishing to participate should have serious experience in rowing or sculling and practise duely, as the journey is physically demanding (even seasoned oarsmen develop calluses by the finish line). The event is mainly for teams, completing Voga Longa on a single oar is considered a major achievement. Extreme participation (scuba frogmen and surface swimmers) sometimes occurs, but it is not recommended due to water contamination issues. Late May. (date needs fixing)\n\n\n=== Opera and concerts ===\n4 La Fenice Theater (Teatro La Fenice), Campo San Fantin, San Marco 1965 (300 m west of San Marco square), \u260f +39 041 786511, info@teatrolafenice.org.

Daily 11:00-17:00. \u20ac5 full price; \u20ac4 concession. \n\n\n=== Activities on a boat ===\n\n\n==== Gondolas ====\nRiding a gondola along the canals with your own gondoliere, the oarsmen who symbolizes the city, is one of the major joys of being in Venice. It's also one of the most expensive, as gondolier-for-hire business licences are limited to just 430 to 455 oarsmen in Venice, making the market artificially scarce and inflating prices. The gondoliers trade is shaped by 900 years of tradition: most are born locals, and it wasn't until 2010 that Venice got its first licensed female gondolier.\nShort trips of 30 minutes to an hour cost upwards of \u20ac100. A small comfort is that the price is per ride, and not per person. Most gondolas can accommodate between three and four people. Make sure you reach an agreement on price and time before you start in order to avoid unpleasant surprises. There are many tips on how to negotiate prices in guidebooks; some are pretty wild and even include walking away and letting them chase you. Whatever method you choose, bargaining with the gondolieres might knock \u20ac20-30 off the price. However, there's an informal habit among the oarsmen to cut the most interesting and little-known parts from the journey path for \"discount\" customers. Reduced rate riders get less marvel in exchange for a moderate price drop, which may not be worth it.\n\n\n==== Vaporetto and traghetti ====\nIf you find spending hundreds of euros for a gondola to be a bit much, ride a vaporetto or traghetto instead. There are plenty of vaporetto lines that passe by interesting sights at a more manageable price of \u20ac5\u201310. Additionally, one can cross the canals on a traghetti, stripped down gondolas used as municipal ferries. In the 1950s there were as many as thirty, but now there are seven points to find them, with some only operating at rush hours. The length of any crossing is just a few minutes. Many visitors enjoy visiting the open air markets near the Rialto Bridge and there is a traghetto station there, at the Pescheria (fish market) joining the Santa Sophia church along the Strada Nova. You will notice that traghetti passengers tend to stand up, but if you are not comfortable doing so, sitting is possible, if you are careful.\n\n\n==== Rowing clubs ====\nVenice is home to several expensive rowing clubs.\n\n\n=== Other ===\n\nSpend a day on the islands, mainly Murano, Burano and Torcello. There are boat services to all these islands at scheduled times, including between the islands themselves. Be prepared for long lines and long waits for the boats between islands. The Glass Museum in Murano and the Lace Museum in Burano are certainly worth a visit. In Burano you will find some of the most picturesque streets and houses, with each house sporting a different pastel shade. Its really beautiful. Though there is not much to see in Torcello except for the old church, and the supposed \"Throne of Atilla\". However, the peace and tranquility of the island is not to be found anywhere else in Venice! Torcello is also home to a very expensive Cipriani restaurant. But just walking around on these islands is a nice enough experience. If you've had enough of the hype and the other tourists, hop off the vaporetto at 'Cimitero', Venice's graveyard for a peaceful walk. There are many famous tombs, and the section dedicated to deceased children is particularly haunting. There is also a free toilet there.\nWhile going through Venice, make sure you take in the beauty of it all. Walk through the alley ways, and take the water taxi to different parts of the island, sometimes at night you can just go sit in an open area and watch locals and tourists passing by. It is wonderful. There are many museums and churches that are around the city that allow tourists to go in a visit. They are many great sights to keep you busy throughout your visit.\nThe \u201cSecret Itineraries in Doge's Palace\u201d worth a visit, take the visitor into the most secret and fascinating rooms in the Palace. It's better to book in advance.\nBecause Venice is now pretty much only inhabited by tourists and people serving the trade, it gets very quiet by 21:00 and there is very little to do in the evening (outside of eating). There are a few exceptions, like some classical music concerts, which most probably only play Vivaldi.\nIf you would like to have a guide to show up the highlights of Venice, you can choose between many offers. There are walking or boat tours, focused on shopping or history or for art lovers, and many itineraries.\nTake photos, using your camera or phone on every corner of Venice will inspire you. And if you have taken good pictures, consider entering the photo competition \"OneDayInVenezia\",  running all year round, awarding monthly winners, and dedicated to amateur photographers. The Grand Prize is a weekend in Venice, trip included.\nSend a postcard or even better, an entire letter dedicated to a loved one (the old \"snail mail\" one, not the electronic variety)! Venice has a long, celebrated tradition in postal services, paper and written communication in general (including one of the earliest medieval book printing houses).\nVenice it's also Riviera del Brenta old canals. The Riviera del Brenta is famous for its extraordinary Palladian villas along the Brenta river, its museums and historical buildings and it is 40 km (25 miles) from Venice. This Riviera and its mainland include 7 small cities: Stra, Fiesso d\u2019Artico, Dolo, Foss\u00f2, Mira, Oriago and Malcontenta.\nThese places are good for cycling excursions and to see antique Palladian Villas built on the Brenta river. In Stra village, there is the famous gardens of Villa Pisani and the museum of the shoes is in Villa Foscarini Rossi. In this last museum you can admire 1,500 models of Italian-made shoes created in local factories for major brands including Fendi, Genny, Yves Saint Laurent, Givenchy, Ungaro, Anne Kleyn, Richard Tyles and Vera Wang.\nIn Dolo village you can visit the square, old watermill (XI century) and big open air market.\n\n Teatro San Gallo, \u260f +39 041 2412002.

Their home ground Stadio Pier Luigi Penzo (capacity 11,000) is on Sant'Elena, connected by streets to the main east island.\n\n\n== Learn ==\nVenice is home to two major (and expanding) public universities, Universit\u00e0 Ca' Foscari Venezia and Universit\u00e0 Iuav di Venezia. There are possibly hundreds of smaller schools in the city. Neither university exploits its name for merchandising, and \"Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Venezia\" sweatshirts for sale at stalls are not only unlicensed, but there is no single university in the city with that name to begin with.\n\n\n== Buy ==\n\nVenice has always been a city of merchants. Consequently, most of the Venetians working in Venice still own or work at a shop. The pride of the Republic of Venice was the extreme diversity and quality of goods and services which could be found in Venice. These days, however, mass tourism led Venice to be populated with many shops selling low-quality souvenirs. The local shops are suffering a lot from this situation and it is not easy to identify them within the crowd of shops selling harmful imported goods. Buying from the authentic local businesses has never been more important, as it is essential to the future of the Venetians and guarantees you to get the real thing and to have a much better experience of Venice. It is not easy, though. Thankfully, there is a social enterprise in Venice that works closely with the Venetian business owners (shops, restaurants and bars included). They have a certification process where the local artisan shops attest and commit to be selling products both authentic and sustainable as well as to give a 10% discount to the customers carrying a Venezia Autentica Friends' Pass (buyable online for only \u20ac10).\nEuronet runs the majority of ATMs within tourist areas, which carry both hefty ATM fees and extortionate exchange rates. To avoid the extortionate exchange rates, you should reject the first currency conversion offered to you, which will allow you to default to your bank's rate. When possible, you should use ATMs provided by actual banks and financial institutions. The Credit Agricole ATM machines are notable because they do not charge ATM fees or offer excessive currency conversion rates for most Visa Debit and Prepaid cards. \n\n Atelier Marega.

Just like in every major Italian city, you get the big fashion brand names. For label clothing shopping, the best area is that around the Piazza San Marco, where you can find Versace, MaxMara, Gucci, Armani, Louis Vuitton, Prada (and numerous more) big names. If you want to shop for clothing or accessories, though, you don't necessarily have to shop through the biggest names in fashion. In the Campo Santo Stefano and Calle della Mandola, you can get less famous or local boutiques, but you can find some excellent quality and/or unique items such as clothes, shoes, wallets or handbags.\nLook for the hand-made paper and the exquisite miniature buildings made by Moro. Watch out for fakes; Moro \"signs\" his name on the back. Also, beware of fakes and \"free\" trips to neighboring Murano for its famous glass. (See article for details.)\nTourist Traps: \"Coloured Pasta\" and \"Venetian Limoncello\" (not the original napolitan one) are not Italian food, no Italian would ever eat them, they are particularly made for tourists. For typical regional Italian food in food shops, check the labels to discover where they have been made.\nDon't miss the Rialto market on San Polo, the smallest sestiere. The Rialto market is for shoppers. To the east is an area of small shops and restaurants; to the west is the Rialto farmers' market. Shopping is slightly less expensive than in the tourist-filled Piazza San Marco.\n\n\n=== Murano Glass ===\n L\u2019Isola, Calle de le Botteghe, San Marco 2970, \u260f +39 041 523 1973, info@lisola.com. \n Archimede Seguso, San Marco 143, \u260f +39 041 5289041. \n Venini, Piazzetta Leoncini, San Marco 314, \u260f +39 041 5224045, venezia@venini.it. \n\n\n== Eat ==\nIndividual listings can be found in Venice's district articles\n\nVenice is home to a rich and distinct regional cuisine and there are numerous wonderful restaurants, including a few Michelin starred ones. However, the city is also home to many more mediocre eateries that will not shy away from serving you undercooked pasta for overinflated prices. This has led to it becoming widely regarded that the restaurants in Venice serve food of a quality and in quantities much lower than anywhere else in Italy. However, with a bit of caution and planning ahead you'll have many excellent experiences eating in Venice. Rule of thumb is that if there's a waiter outside pimping for business, it's probably best avoided!\nOne of Venice's trademark foods is Sepe al nero, cuttlefish and its ink. This intense black ink serves as a sauce and ingredient for polenta (corn meal), risotto (rice), and pasta. These dishes are normally indicated by the Italian words \"nella seppia\" (in cuttlefish), \"alla seppia\" (in the style of cuttlefish), or \"nero di seppia,\" (black of the cuttlefish). For example, Polenta Nella Seppia is fried corn meal with the black ink of a cuttlefish. Despite the intensity in color, the ink has a surprisingly mild taste. Other Veneitian dishes include Fegato alla veneziana, chopped liver, cooked with chopped onions and Sarde in saor: fried sardines, dipped in fried onion, raisins and pine nuts, spices and vinegar. \nFor snacks, Venice has its own version of tapas, the cicchetti. Often paired with wine you will find that most restaurants and bars serve some variant of it. There are also many 'bacaros in Venice, a wine bar that serves a wide selection of cicchetti to go along.\nWhat Venice is not famous for is its pizza, Italy is a big country and pizza is generally more of a speciality in its southern parts. While there are restaurants serving it and some even do it acceptably, don't compare it to other parts of the country. If you really are craving for pizza, try the local chain Pizzeria Ae Oche. Meals are plentiful and prices reasonable, look to spend between \u20ac5-10 for a pizza depending on how exotic your selection is. For Americans, you can find a place called Quanto Basta pizza that serves an American-style pizza with pepperoni and french fries.\nBe careful when the prices are on a weight basis (typically by the \"etto\", abbreviated \"/hg\". or 100 g). One dish can easily contain 400g of fish or meat (almost a pound) - coming to 4 times the indicated base price! Restaurants might offer low prices for food on their menus that they advertise outside the entrance, but they will sometimes compensate this by charging high prices for drinks (which is naturally *not* advertised). \u20ac5 for 33 cl of beer is not uncommon. Le Bauta, an eatery on Fond del Gaffaro, is a good example. Also, please make sure that you get your change back after payment as sometimes it may be 'forgotten' by the waiters.\n\n\n=== Budget ===\nTo save money at lunch, eat standing up - that's what Venetians themselves do. Every cafe, trattoria, osteria, enoteca or whatever it chooses to call itself is stocked at lunchtime with cicchetti - Venetian tapas, including tramezzini (triangular sandwiches on white bread), bite-sized rolls with various cold cuts, polpette (fried balls of minced fish or meat) and assorted antipasti. Order by pointing at what you want on the glass shelves, and wash the whole thing down with a glass of wine (un' ombra) or a spritz (made with, in order of bitterness and alcohol content, Aperol, Campari or Select). Bear in mind that as soon as you allow yourself to sit at the table and be waited on, instead of ordering and consuming your food at the counter, the prices for the same items go up - you can end up paying double. If you look at the (government-mandated) chart of prices stapled to the wall near the bar, you'll see 2 columns of numbers, accommodating this arrangement. However, sitting is worth it if you plan on staying a while. Some places will also serve free bread and water for seated patrons, but then there is usually also a small charge (\u20ac1-3 per person) for \"pane e coperto\" (bread and cover charge).\nThere are a few supermarkets in the city, so if you are in the need to save some money, these are an option as they serve a wide array of prepared and semi-prepared food. On the main street from the station to the Rialto bridge there is a Coop and a Billa supermarket. There are still many small bakery shops and \"biavaroli\" where you can buy bread, cheese etc., particularly near the Rialto market area. For fresh fruit (including chilled coconut) watch out for the street market stalls. There is always a boat parked in the canal on campo San Barnaba selling fruit and vegetables into the late hours.\nIf you want to buy water (Venice has excellent free tap water easily accessible at the numerous fountains located outside throughout the city) it is usually cheapest to get it at the supermarkets: there are Billa or Co-op stores located throughout the city, though supermarkets are often \"disguised\" in nondescript buildings in Venice for space limitations.\nHead to the Dorsoduro area of Venice if you want to save a few euros. It is located on the south side of the city. It has the highest concentration of places where locals, especially students, go to eat. Generally staying away from the main squares will be the cheapest option. If you're willing and able to walk around the town, some back streets offer the best food for the lowest price. Seeing the city from this vantage point is a lot of fun too!\n\n\n=== Mid-range ===\nThe Rialto food markets are an absolute must for fruit, vegetables and cheese, but most of all for the huge range of seafood, much of it fresh out of the lagoon and still moving! There are a variety of small stores around the city that sell fruits and vegetables, but tourists will be hard-pressed to find them. Anything else you will find in the one of the few supermarkets in the city.\n\n\n=== Splurge ===\nThere are 6-7 Michelin star restaurants in Venice, with prices to match.\nNear the Rialto bridge there's a row of restaurants with tables by the canal, where you can have the quintessential Venice experience of dining by the canal lights. Although they do have waiters outside bugging you, some have pretty acceptable quality for price, which is almost always expensive anyway.\n\n\n=== Ice cream ===\nYou will find ice cream all over the city, and you will hardly survive a hot summer day without it. Prices are \u20ac1.00-1.50 for one scoop, \u20ac2.50-3.50 for three scoops.\n\n\n== Drink ==\n\nThe typical local drink loved by all Venetians is Spritz, which is a mix of liquor and Prosecco with sparkling water to top it off. Aperol Spritz is by far the most common but there are variants with Campari or Select too. Almost all bars in the city serves it with prices range from \u20ac5 to \u20ac12, depending on how close you are to the main tourist arteries. Spritz are usually paired with cicheti, the Venetian version of tapas.\nAnother famous drink is the Bellini was invented in Harry's Bar in Venice. It is a mix of white peach juice and Prosecco (the ubiquitous Venetian Champagne-like sparkling wine). Fermented at a low temperature Prosecco develops amylic aromas (fruit drops), though these perhaps mix better with fruit juices than does the more austere Champagne. Classic Bellinis should never be made with Champagne. Although by normal standards expensive, a Bellini in Harry's Bar (\u20ac17 for a 1.5 oz drink is obscene) is still much cheaper than on the terraces of similar '5-star' establishments in the city.\nA small Grappa is a common way to end meals, but be careful as it is brandy with 30 to 60 per cent alcohol.\nBeer in a small pub is about \u20ac5 for a pint (birra media).\n\n\n=== Coffee ===\n\nCoffee is everywhere in Venice, and both Venetians and the tourists avail themselves of the opportunities, usually by downing a quick dose at the counter (see warning about sit-down prices above). Rule of thumb: the bigger (and shinier) the espresso machine, the better the result. Espresso, the real Italian, is about \u20ac1 at the bar, \u20ac2 at a table.\n\n E Rosa Salva. One of the favorites is the mini-chain \"E Rosa Salva\", with three locations in the center - on C. Fiubera (from Piazza San Marco, take the underpass in the middle of the arcade, cross the bridge and take second right off C. Fabbri), Merceria S. Salvadore (off the campo of the same name), and right on Campo San Zanipolo (to the right of the church looking from the canal); the last one is a gelateria as well. For your \u20ac1 you'll get exactly 2 and a half sips at the bottom of a small cup, with rich crema and no bitterness. Assorted house-made sweets are \u20ac1.10. \n\n\n=== Nightlife ===\nThere are a number of fantastic bars in Venice, most are small places with lots of charm. Bars that stay open after 23:00 are clustered around a few late-night drinking areas in Venice. Notice that Piazza San Marco is not one of them, although it is very pleasant with many people wandering around late.\nThe actual late night scene is in either Campo Santa Margherita, where the student crowds from nearby the University Ca' Foscari in Dorsoduro hangs out; upscale Erbaria on the West side of the Rialto Bridge where the main vegetable market is held during the day and along Fondamenta de la Misericordia in Cannaregio. The bars along Fondamenta de la Misericordia is anchored by Paradiso Perduto, which features live music on most nights. There's usually youths cruising (in motor boats) along the canal, blaring Italian rap songs in Italian from the loudspeakers. \nPub crawls are best planned in advance, as there's a real risk of wasting an hour or two wandering aimlessly in search of a watering hole that's open, especially midweek. Most bars close at 1 AM, so make sure you notice which ones are open until 2 AM or 3 AM.\nThere's next to no night clubs in proper Venice, to get to those you have to follow the locals and head over the bridge into Mestre, or hop on the boat to Lido. Those looking for LGBT nightlife in Venice will be disappointed. Hop on the train to Padua instead.\n\n\n=== Pubs ===\nThere are two Irish pubs in Venice. One is located along the Strada Nova in Cannaregio; the other one is the Inishark just before Campo Santa Maria Formosa.\n\n\n== Sleep ==\n\nDue to the historic city's constrained area and international popularity hotels are expensive. Bed and Breakfasts and guesthouses offer better rates. Real budget solutions (like camping and hostels) can be found in Mestre  (mainland Venice) and on the island of Lido. Alternative accommodation can also be found on the island of Murano. These are worth considering since historic centre is quite well-connected with buses and ferries, so staying further from the centre is not such a big problem, as for example it takes only 11 minutes to travel from Mestre to islands of Venice by train.\nIn the last few years, holiday or short rentals apartments have increased in number and quality, now you can rent (minimum stay is usually 3 nights) a Palazzo on the Grand Canal as a little flat near Rialto.\n\n\n== Connect ==\nAs of Sept 2021, Venice has 4G from Iliad and TIM, and 5G from Vodafone and Wind Tre.\nThe city has been steadily building out the municipal Wi-Fi network, which now covers almost the entire area around the Grand Canal and some of the larger squares in the center. You can buy guest access at approximately \u20ac5 per day at the same unified Venezia Unica site where the transport and museum passes are sold. However if you only need occasional access, it may not be worth buying this as you can get free wifi at most accommodations and at a lot of the museums in Venice.\nVenice has several internet cafes, but they are much more expensive than the rest of Europe with prices for an hour of access around \u20ac6. Wi-Fi is only available at some of them. There's a wonderful pub, Cafe Blue in Dorsoduro, which has free (password-protected) wi-fi. Buy a spritz and a panini and go to town.\nAt the Telecom Italia Future Centre in Campo San Salvatore (San Marco) you can browse for free for one hour, once registered with your ID card.\nTo use an Internet cafe, buy a mobile SIM card or get a contract for an Internet connection. Personal identification is needed by law in Italy. Internet cafes will not let you use computers without a passport or national ID card.\nCalle Delle Botteghe on San Marco 2970 Venezia is a pretty art gallery type internet cafe with a book shop. It is on the expensive side with \u20ac3 for 15 min but you can just go in and play chess with a glass of wine.\n\n\n== Stay safe ==\nVenice is considered a safe city. You have to take the habitual travellers' precautions however. Keep your valuable items (like wallet and passport) close to you because there are pickpockets, especially in more crowded parts of the city.\nIn case of need, you can dial free of charge on any phone 112 (no area code needed) to contact Carabinieri or 113 (no area code needed) to contact the Police.\nSometimes, in the evening and night hours, Campo Bella Vienna and Campo Santa Margherita are places for violence, so be careful if you stay here.\n\n\n== Stay healthy ==\nDo not touch or swim in the extremely polluted water in the canals. Some of that water comes from the surrounding Venetian Lagoon, but the rest comes straight from toilets and kitchen sinks. Venice has begun to install septic tanks in buildings, but much of the city has not yet been upgraded and releases untreated sewage directly into the canals. Avoid bathing yourself, touching the water, immersing feet, etc. in the canals looking for refreshment in the hot season. Also, at night there is a risk of falling into the water, as there are many alleys which end in the water but have little or no lighting. In the warmest months, these conditions can sometimes generate foul odors. Choose other times to visit if they might ruin what should be a highly enjoyable stay.\nCurrent regulations forbid certain behaviour, including bathing in the canals and walking around in a swimsuit or bare-chested. Violations are subject to fines up to \u20ac500 and being banned from the city for the next 48 hours, even if you have a prepaid hotel room and non-refundable tickets to events. More information is available on #EnjoyRespectVenezia website.\nYou can reach the emergency medical service dialing free of charge on any phone 118 (no area code needed, conversation will be recorded) to have assistance and an ambulance sent to you.\nChemists' shops (Italian: Farmacie) are all around the town. They are open 24 hr a day, 7 days a week on a rotational basis: outside the shop there's always the list of operating ones with timetables, address and phone number. If you need a special drug you might be asked to book it in advance if it's not in common use. Note that the commercial name or brand of your prescription might differ from your country of origin, and make sure that the medication you want is available in the EU.\n\n\n== Respect ==\nMuch of Venice's famous architecture is extremely old and showing the effects of being mishandled by the flood of tourists, some small fraction of whom behave as if they were in a modern holiday resort complex instead of an ancient city. To preserve the wonder of this city for future generations, everyone needs to treat the city's infrastructure as if you were in a large, open-air art museum.\nThe city officials state that it is necessary to enforce rules that preserve the city's urban cleanliness and make sure visitors behave themselves. The following tips will come in handy: \n\nWalk on the right side of the street; especially on narrower streets, you'll contribute to making your and other\u2019s walk faster, safer, and tidier. Do it always, even if the street is empty. Do not block the flow of traffic, especially on bridges.\nDo not bathe, dive into, or swim in the canals; it is not only dangerous and unhealthy (the canals are the city's ancient open-air sewage system, not to mention the mud churned up by the motorboat traffic and the risk of being hit by one), but it is also punishable by a fine of \u20ac350, and the police can immediately ban you from the area.\nDo not sit down or lie down on the ground, on monuments, on steps, on bridges, on buildings (or even lean against them), or sit in public on anything else except chairs and benches made for this purpose, and especially do not sit on the ground to eat. Picnics are banned in all public areas. They are punishable by a fine of \u20ac100\u2013200, and the police can immediately ban you from the area. If you need to rest or want to watch the people going by, look for one of Venice's bright red public benches to sit (but not lie down) on.\nDo not camp or sleep in public areas; the fine is \u20ac200, and the police will immediately ban you from the area.\nDo not walk around bare-chested or in swimwear; this is punishable by a fine of up to \u20ac250.\nDo not feed the birds or other wildlife and do not litter; the fines go up to \u20ac500. It may seem strange that feeding the birds has a higher potential fine than disrespectful stunts like climbing on top of a monument, but the city is located inside a fragile wetlands ecosystem, so please exercise more than the usual care.\nThe municipality of Venice maintains an up-to-date list of rules and regulations in English and several other langues at their official website.\n\n\n== Cope ==\n\n\n=== Orientation ===\nThe unfortunate side-effect of the small alleys which make Venice such a delight to visit is that it is remarkably easy to get lost. Even maps provided by hotels are frequently inaccurate, and the maze-like structure of the city can become very confusing. The tight cluster of little islands that comprise Venice is completely surrounded by the Lagoon, so it is not possible, no matter how lost you become, to leave Venice on foot. Sooner or later you will come upon a piazza that you can locate on your map.\nOne tip: as you cross bridges, note the house numbers before and after. A small change probably means you are on the same island/district and have crossed a \"new\" canal. A major change means you are now on another island. Most maps clump islands together into their voting districts, there are many more islands than districts.\nOne piece of assistance is to look for directional signs. These will be marked \"Per\" and then with the name of a prominent location or bridge in the city, complete with an arrow pointing in the relevant direction. Hence, to get to the Rialto bridge, the signs to follow are marked \"Per Rialto\". Those to St Mark's Square read \"Per S Marco\", and those to the train station \"Per Ferrovia\" (there are some others as well). Having oriented yourself to the nearest landmark, direction-finding can thus become (slightly) easier.\nRemember, though, that the signs to read are the official ones. Graffiti will occasionally give other directions, frequently incorrect ones.\nThat said, some argue that getting lost in Venice is part of the experience of the city. The number of photogenic canals, hidden restaurants and shops where glass blowing is done almost guarantees that there is no such thing as a \"dull neighbourhood\". Additionally, the public transport means that it is relatively easy to arrive at the intended destination even after one has emerged from the web of alleys in a totally unexpected place.\n\n\n=== Overcrowding ===\nWhile Venice may not get more tourists than other famous Italian destinations such as Rome and Florence, the narrowness of streets and open areas may at times make Venice feel uncomfortably crowded during (but not only) the peak seasons, at the San Marco sestiere, the surroundings of the Rialto bridge and the streets leading from Venezia Santa Lucia and Piazzale Roma to San Marco. Walking by itself can be difficult, let alone snapping a good photo, using a public lavatory, or sitting at a decent cafe or restaurant.\nTo avoid the worst of the crowds, unless it is winter, try to visit the San Marco and Rialto bridge areas during early morning and late evening. During the late morning and afternoon, stay away as far as possible from this area, for instance walking around west Santa Croce, north Cannaregio, eastern Castello and Giudecca. Alternatively, take day trips to places outside central Venice such as Burano, the Lido, Padua or Vicenza, or simply take the opportunity to refresh in your hotel.\n\n\n=== Useful telephone numbers ===\n Police (emergency call), \u260f 113. \n Carabinieri (emergency call), \u260f 112. \n First Aid (emergency call), \u260f 118. \n Venice Hospital, \u260f +39 041 5294111. \n Medical Service on Duty, \u260f +39 041 5294060. \n Tourist Information, \u260f +39 041 5298700. \n Gondola Service San Marco, \u260f +39 041 5200685. \n Gondola Service Rialto, \u260f +39 041 5224904. \n Gondola Service Danieli, \u260f +39 041 5222254. \n Airport San Marco Information, \u260f +39 041 2609260. \n Airport San Marco Lost and Found Office, \u260f +39 041 2609222. \n Railway information, \u260f 892021 (in country only). \n Railway Lost and Found Office, \u260f +39 041 785531. \n\n\n=== Consulates ===\nMost of the consulates listed here are only honorary consulates, so can only offer limited consular services.

        "title": "Casablanca",
        "extract": "Casablanca (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0636\u0627\u0621, Dar al-Bayda) may be the cosmopolitan, industrial and economic heart of Morocco, and its largest city, but it is one of the less endearing of the country's sights. With a small, unassuming medina and a traffic-congested ville nouvelle, travellers arriving via Casablanca may be tempted to find the first train out to nearby Rabat. The awe-inspiring Hassan II Mosque and happening nightlife and architecture (mostly colonial times buildings), however, are worth at least a day of your Moroccan itinerary.\n\n\n== Understand ==\n\nThe modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and the Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa. The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755. The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya and it was given the name Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading bases there. The French occupied the city in 1907, establishing it as a protectorate in 1912 and starting construction of the ville nouvelle.\nDuring World War II in Africa, Morocco became part of Vichy France, a non-belligerent puppet state of Germany. Casablanca became a haven for spies, as well as well-off Europeans who wanted to escape the war, with a prospect to flee to the New World. The 1942 film Casablanca presented the intrigues of the city in a romanticized manner.\nMorocco gained independence in 1956, and Casablanca is now Morocco's largest city with a population of almost 4 million. It has the world's largest artificial port, but no ferry service of any kind. Casablanca is also the most liberal and progressive of Morocco's cities. Young men flirt brazenly with scantily-clad women, designer labels are the norm in the chic, beachfront neighbourhood of 'Ain Diab and many young Moroccans speak to each other in a mix of Arabic and French.\nBut not everyone is living the Casablancan dream. Tens of thousands of rural Moroccans who fled the drought-ravaged interior to find work in the city are struggling under high unemployment rates and expensive housing. The poverty, prevalent in slums on the city's outskirts, has led to high rates of crime, drug use, prostitution and the rise of Islamism.\nCasablanca is a mixed bag of Moroccan extremes.\n\n\n== Get in ==\n\n\n=== By plane ===\nCasablanca's airport is the busiest gateway to the country. Royal Air Maroc flies to New York JFK, Washington Dulles, Montreal, many cities in Europe, and has connecting flights to African countries such as Nigeria, Central African Republic, Senegal and others. WizzAir flies from Rome.\n1 Mohammed V Int'l Airport (CMN  IATA). There are two terminals: Terminal 1 handles domestic and international flights, Terminal 2 - only international ones. Airport has ATMs, bank branches and currency exchange, post office, pharmacy, cafes, grocery stores and duty-free outlets. Arrive at the airport a tad earlier as there is a very slow security check after the train.   (updated Aug 2022)\nGetting there/away:\n\nThe only available public transport is train, departures are every hour, journey time 45 min, 70/50 dirham for 1/2 class (as of Jan 2023). Operating hours: 3:00 - 22:00 for departures from the city and 04:00 to 23:45 for departures from the airport; trains leave at 50 minutes past the hour. The train schedule is available at the ONCF website.\nTaxi, the fare to Casablanca is 280 dirham (as of Nov 2022).\nFor more international connections and budget flights you may also want to consider flying to the airports of Rabat, Marrakesh, Fes or Tangier. From there you can take an intercity bus or train to Casablanca. From Tangier there is also a high-speed train.\n\n\n=== By train ===\nThe most convenient way to reach major Moroccan cities is by train. Trains are divided into first and second-class compartments; the first-class ones generally cost an extra 50%, but have more room and guarantee a seat. In case of boarding second-class compartments and not finding available seats, head to first class and pay the difference to the ticket collector.\nCasa Port station is closer to the center but it serves only a couple of trains, while the main station is Casa Voyageurs. It has trains to Meknes/Fez/Oujda, Marrakech or Tangier with stops in between. Trains for Rabat leave half-hourly. The trains are comfortable with boards displaying the time of departure/arrival. ONCF site for checking the schedule.\n\n2 Casa-Voyageurs railway station (Gare Casa-Voyageurs) (2 km from the city centre, a half an hour walk or short petit taxi (~15 dirham) ride. Tram #1, also calls at the station). This is the only station in Casablanca served by the Al Boraq high speed train traveling between Casablanca and Tangier via Rabat and Kenitra.   (updated Feb 2023)\n3 Casa-Port railway terminal (Gare de Casa-Port).   (updated Sep 2021)\n4 Oasis railway station (Gare de l'Oasis), Route de l'Oasis, 20410. Smaller station in the southern parts of the city   (updated Sep 2021)\n\n\n=== By bus ===\nCTM and other private companies run services to most Moroccan cities as well as a number of European cities:\n\nMarrakech \u2013 every 1-2 hr, 4 hr, 80-95 dirham.\nEssaouira \u2013 3-4 buses per day, 6-7 hr, CTM 140 dirham / regular 110 dirham.\nEl Jadida \u2013 hourly, 1\u00bd hr, 25 dirham.\nRabat \u2013 at least hourly, 1\u00bd hr, 30-40 dirham.\nOther longer-distance routes exist (sometimes overnight) from Meknes, Fez, Ouarzazate.\n\n5 Gare CTM, 23 Rue Leon l'Africain. M-Su 04:00-00:00. Bus station for CTM buses. (updated May 2019)\n6 Gare Routi\u00e8re, Ouled Ziane. The main bus terminal serving all destinations. The fares are slightly cheaper and buses tend to leave more frequently than CTM, however their quality might be lower and sometimes slower (always ask if they use the highway [autoroute]).  (updated May 2019)\nGetting there/away: Gare Routi\u00e8re is on the outskirts of the city. Local buses are obscure and unreliable, buses #10 and #11 supposedly run there. A taxi from downtown (or Casa Voyageurs) should cost no more than 12 dirham, although you may have a hard time getting this fare (especially from downtown). There is a grand taxi rank about 200 m south of Place des Nations Unies, get there for 6 dirham per person.\n\n\n=== By car ===\nThere is a well maintained toll that runs from Tangier to El Jadida, passing through Casablanca and Rabat.\nThe minimum driving age in Casablanca is 21. Always carry your driver's licence and passport while driving. Avoid driving if possible: car rental prices are high as is the accident rate. If you are leaving Casablanca by car, make sure to fill up in the city. Gas/petrol stations becomes scarce outside Casablanca.\n\n\n== Get around ==\n\n \n\nA government department puts out an exhaustive map of Casablanca in book form called Carte Guide de Casablanca that you can find in bookstores or online; in all likelihood, though, it isn't necessary.\nOther than that, Casablanca is like any European city: the streets (mostly) have signs, and passersby are extremely helpful in French or Arabic and, more rarely, Spanish or English. The Medina can be hard to navigate, but it's so small that no matter how blindly you wander into it, you're never more than ten minutes from an exit.\n\n\n=== By tram ===\n\nCasablanca is one of the two Moroccan cities with a tram. The first line opened in late 2012. Service runs from 05:30 to 22:30 with frequent trains (during the day, the interval seems to be shorter than 10 minutes).\nMost vending machines only take coins. One journey is 6 dirham with a rechargeable card, 8 dirham otherwise. A fee of 2 dirham will be added for the card when you buy a ticket. Tram stops are announced in Arabic and French. Further information including the network (\"r\u00e9seau\") and schedule (\"horaires\") is available in French and Arabic on the Casa Tramway website.\n\n\n=== By train ===\nThe Al Bidaoui service (i.e. airport service) also has some stops in the city, although they are spaced out much further from each other compared to the tram.\n\n\n=== By bus ===\nMany bus companies run through the city, the bus routes are the same for a given number, although the route remains completely unclear (Google maps has some bus stops for Casa though).\nGoing by bus is the cheapest way to get around (5 dirham) but some companies such as Hana Bus have vehicles in a disastrous state. It could be worth taking the chance given the cost-saving and experience of what many locals experience, but watch out for pickpockets.\n\n\n=== By taxi ===\nAll taxis red in colour, drivers know how to get to every single place in every single guide book, even if you tell them just \"the restaurant on Blvd. Hassan II.\" Check the meter is running to avoid being overcharged at the end of the trip. Don't be surprised if the taxi stops to pick someone else up. The minimum fare is 7 dirham. White \"grand taxis\" are another local alternative. They have a defined itinerary so you should know in which station you should take it depending on your destination (ask locals, they will inform you easily). They only leaves when they are full, which means two people on the passenger seat and four people in the back, so expect to be packed likes sardines. However, it is cheaper than the red taxi, especially for longer distances.\n\n\n== See ==\n\nAlmost all of the things to see in Casablanca are in the north of the city; very few maps even show the southern end of this sprawling metropolis. \n\n1 King Hassan II Mosque, Blvd Sidi Mohammed Ben Abdallah (Half an hour walk from the closest tram stop at Place des Nations Unies, taxi from anywhere in central centre shouldn\u2019t be more than 20 dirham), \u260f +212 5 22 48 28 86, +212 5 22 48 28 89. Tours: Sa-Th 09:00, 10:00, 11:00, 12:00; F 09:00, 10:00 and 15:00. In summer (Mar 15-Sep 15) also at 16:00. The largest mosque in Morocco and the third largest in the world. The 210 m high minaret is the tallest in the world. It opened in 1993, after six years of construction. It is one of the two main mosques in Morocco open to non-Muslims. Beautiful interior complete with water features, a roof that opens to the sky, a huge hammam in the basement (not in use), and beautiful tile work. 130 dirham for Mosque, 30 dirham for museum, 140 for combined ticket.   (updated Jan 2023)\n2 Old Medina (north of the Place des Nations Unies). This is a small traditional walled town in the north of Casablanca. If you are in town it's worth a visit, but it is nothing compared to the glories of Fez or Marrakesh. \n3 The Corniche. A neighborhood on the ocean, west of the Hassan II Mosque. Decades ago it was a thriving resort area - hotels line the ocean side of the Boulevard de la Corniche, and nightclubs line the other side. Most look like they've seen better days. Along the Boulevard de l'Ocean Atlantique are many newer, fancier hotels. The Corniche is also home to many western fast food chains. A new western-style movie theater can also be found here, but the best option is to walk up and down the street, resting at one of the many ocean-view cafes. \n4 Shrine of Sidi Abderrahman. Built on a rock off shore, well past The Corniche, and only accessible at low tide. The shrine itself is off-limits to non-Muslims, but visitors are permitted to explore the tiny, medina-like neighborhood that has sprung up around it. A better bet is to walk to it along the beach and catch a view of the beautiful white walls before taking a cab to less remote areas. \n5 Mahkama du Pacha. M-Sa 08:00-12:00 & 14:00-18:00. This is a Hispanic-Moorish building comprised of more than 60 ornate rooms with delicately carved wooden ceilings. There are many stuccoes and intricate wrought-iron railings as well as beautifully tiled floors. While entrance may be free it is not easy to get in. You need to find a guide to accompany you.

The only museum devoted to Judaism in the Arab world. Within the museum, visitors can find artifacts of Moroccan Jewry, including the bimah (c. 1944) from the Beni-Issakhar Synagogue in Casablanca, mezuzahs, and Hanukiah menorah. The museum also touts a considerable collection of Berber history, including costumes, jewelry, and Fatima pendants.

This is multi-use but primarily for soccer. It's the usual stadium for the men's national team, and home ground for Wydad AC and Raja CA, both playing in Botola the top tier. The stadium was built in 1955 and last renovated in 2015, with a capacity of 45,891. In Dec 2025 - Jan 2026 it hosts matches in the Africa Cup of Nations, including the final.  (updated Feb 2024)\n\n\n== Buy ==\nCasablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco. Around the old Medina it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs and a whole spectrum of knicknacks, but it's all for the tourists. Much better to wait until you're in Fes and can bargain with someone who sells things to both Moroccans and tourists.\nThe Maarif neighbourhood (near the twin centre, around Boulevard al Massira al Khadra) has many name-brand European and American fashion chains, such as Zara. Designer glasses, leather shoes, and \"genuine\" belts, bags, and shirts can be had at bargain prices.\n1 Morocco Mall. A huge mall including a variety of shops and a cinema (supposedly it's north Africa's second largest shopping centre). It is located at the very southwest of the city (further down from Ain Diab/Anfa).   \nThe Derb Ghalef neighbourhood has a huge souq that is not for the faint of heart. A cluster of small shanties, each one is loaded with \"genuine\" mobile phones, \"genuine\" watches and \"genuine\" \"brand name\" clothing. The shops are separated by alleys no more than three feet wide, some of which double as drainage ditches. There are numerous fruit smoothie stands in the centre, which make a good spot for regrouping and planning your excursion. The stall owners are, of course, kings of negotiating, and without a good grasp on Arabic and a strong backbone, you're likely to pay well over the going rate for anything.\nPeople interested in art find a decent amount of art galleries (the renowned galleries can be found in the \"See\" section).\n\n\n== Eat ==\nRestaurants in Morocco are like restaurants in Spain - they don't open until around 19:00 at the earliest, and most people don't eat until much later. Be sure to call first and make sure your restaurant of choice is actually open.\n\n\n=== Budget ===\n\n\n==== Around the Arab League Park ====\n1 Brasserie La Cigale, Blvd Brahim Roudani (just south of the Rampwan de L'unite Africaine). An unassuming bar close to the Park of the Arab League, with a restaurant in front that serves only basic food (sausage or kefta sandwiches, salads, and the like.) The bar in the back is more crowded and has live music most nights. Beer is served with a plate of olives or popcorn, and it's one of the few Moroccan-style bars where women can drink in peace. Wine and spirits are available, but only when eating in the restaurant. A few phrases in Arabic to Aisha, the barkeeper, will win her heart and ensure a constant supply of olives. (updated Mar 2022)\n\n\n==== Quartier Palmier ====\n2 Solidarit\u00e9 F\u00e9minine Association's restaurant, Rue de Bethle\u00e9m (Red taxi or Tramway station Wafasalaf), \u260f +212 6 19 11 11 16. M-F from 12:00 to 14:30. The Association \"Solidarit\u00e9 F\u00e9minine\" has implemented a training program to encourage the socio-economic integration single mothers. 35 dirham for the dish of the day, a salad and home made bread. Mint tea and Moroccan pastries available. (updated Apr 2022)\n\n\n=== Mid-range ===\n\n La Corrida, 59 Rue el Araar, \u260f +212 22 27 81 55. From the outside, it's easy to miss this restaurant, but look for the little sign ringed in blinking lights. It has a nice outdoor courtyard, but the inside is the main attraction. It's decorated like with memorabilia from Spanish bull fighting tournaments and has a dark, candle-lit vibe that's perfect for dates. The sangria is tasty, as is the Tapas menu (which changes daily). Seafood is the specialty, and the steamed mussels should not be missed. \n Taverne du Dauphin, 115 Blvd Felix Houphouet, \u260f +212 22 22 12 00. A little seafood place within walking distance of the old medina, the port, and the Park of the Arabic League, this place can get crowded at meal times. An excellent selection of seafood and one of the widest beer selections in all of Morocco (though that's only 5 or 6 different brews) makes this a very popular lunch spot. The fish is fresh from the fishermen at the port, and the shellfish (oysters, mussels and so on) are delicious. When paying, however, keep an eye on the waiters: they'll \"help you count the money,\" which can turn into an elaborate shell game where they'll slip some of the cash into their own pocket. \n Le Kobe D'Or, 9 Rue Abou Salt El Andaloussi (just off of Brahim Roudani), \u260f +212 22 98 07 25. An Asian restaurant that is hard to miss, as it has an enormous red neon sign. The inside is nicely decorated in dark red, with lots of mirrors and Asian details. The food is ho-hum; the soups are great but the chicken tends to be overcooked. Still, a nice place for a quick snack close to the Maarif, a good shopping area. \n3 La Sqala, Blvd. Des Almohades, \u260f +212 22 26 09 60. Built in the remains of an old fortress, this place is worth as much as a cultural attraction as it is a restaurant. On the outskirts of the old medina, it has cannons, walls, defensive positions, and portcullises as well as a nice, clean eating environment. The atmosphere tends to be a little on the touristy side, but the food is a good modern look at traditional Moroccan foods. Some dishes are vegetarian and vegan. They also have the obligatory Moroccan pastries and teas if you're just in the mood for a snack. Great photo opportunity. \n Al Mounia, 95 Rue Prince Moulay Abdullah, \u260f +212 22 22 26 69. This restaurant has an excellent courtyard with a hundred year-old tree. The main drawback is that since this restaurant is listed in most guidebooks, it fills up with tourists at an early hour. The cooking is mostly traditional Moroccan foods, with some of the best couscous in the country. There is also an extensive wine list. \n La Cocina, 55, Rue Mustapha el Manfalouti, Gauthier, a 20m de Zerktouni, \u260f +212 522 463369. The real Spanish taste in Casablanca. Located in the center of Casablanca, this restaurant offers a variety of Spanish dishes, very good rice and paellas dishes and a great selection of authentic Spanish tapas and local and imports wines and beers. Open from noon until midnight without interruption, its nice decor and friendly service make it a must in Casablanca. \n P\u00e2tisserie Bennis Habous, 2, Rue Fkih El Gabbas, \u260f +212 5 22 30 30 25. This place is famed for having some of the best pastries in Morocco. Try one of their famous hornes des gazelles. You should also try the bastilla (one of the most luxurious and prestigious dish in the Morocco's gastronomy, and Benny's is undoubtedly the best one. Choose the pigeon or farm chicken version. You must book it in advance. (updated May 2022)\n\n\n=== Splurge ===\n4 Rick's Cafe, 248 Rue Sour Jdid, \u260f +212 22 27 42 07, info@rickscafe.ma. This restaurant claims to have recreated the eponymous cafe from the movie Casablanca. Excellent location, within a 20-minute walk of the Hassan II Mosque and in the walls of the Old Medina bordering the ocean. The food is excellent, though expensive. Eat at one of the tables on the second floor for an excellent view of the seats below and the niveau-Moroccan decorations or eat on the ground floor to be nearer the piano player who plays, of course, \"As Time Goes By\" every night. Excellent selection of wine and liquor and, for Morocco, a thorough beer selection (5 different brands). The staff, in tuxedos and fezes, are superb. Dress code. Do not show up in shorts. dinner for 2 ~800 dirham.. \n YoSushi, 12 Rue Mohammed Abdou, \u260f +212 22 98 11 90. Sushi is catching on in a big way in Morocco. This little place, on a side street near the prefectural police headquarters, is one of the best. New, clean and trendy, you're unlikely to find anyone in it before 22:00. They serve all the sushi classics: Nigiri, Sashimi, Hosomaki, Maki, Futomakis and assorted other fish items. Though tasty, it can get expensive if your aim is to fill yourself up. Not very many options for vegan diners. \n5 La Table du R\u00e9tro, 22 Rue Abou Al Mahassine Arrayani, \u260f +212 05 22 94 05 55, contact@latableduretro.ma. French cuisine 350 dirham menu. \n\n\n== Drink ==\nNightlife in Casablanca has mixed reviews. Women might feel a bit uncomfortable with the mostly male crowds in many bars and nightclubs. But if you dig a bit, you'll find some excellent spots to drink, dance and people watch. Certain clubs are flooded with prostitutes at night. \nIf you want a drink in your hotel room, supermarkets like Acima and Marjane carry a wide variety of liquor and wine, though the beer selection is fairly stunted. The best places to drink are either European-style restaurants, which usually have a decent selection, or hotel bars, which are inevitably safer and more relaxed. Many western-style nightclubs exist in the Maarif and Gironde neighborhoods. Pubs will cost around 100 dirham per head, it will be half if visited in the happy hours from 19:00-23:00. Pubs to visit Tiger House, La Notte.\n\n1 Restaurant Le Kazbar, 7 Rue Najib Mahfoud, Gauthier (On a street between Blvd Anfa and Blvd Souktani.), \u260f +212 22 20 47 47. A dark and atmospheric place to grab a drink or dinner. Any kind of attire will fly, but if you want to dress up, a night at Kasbar is your chance. (updated Oct 2016)\n2 La Bodega, 129 Rue Allal Ben Abdellah (Near the old downtown and Medina). A Spanish tapas bar, quite original. There can be a wait to get into the basement bar; but once you get inside, you're rewarded with bartenders who eat fire. It's pretty expensive, though, and only frequented by tourists. (updated Jan 2023)\n3 Petit Poucet, 86 Boulevard Mohamed V. A bar that has been around for decades, apparently Little Prince author and aviator Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry already stopped by here. Somewhat worn-down. (updated Oct 2016)\n\n\n== Sleep ==\n\n\n=== Budget ===\n1 Hotel Terminus, Ave Bahmad, Place de la Gare, Casa-Voyageurs (150 meters to West from the train station). Located directly across from the Casa Voyageurs train station. The price is very high for what it is. 250 dirham for a 2-bed room with a sink. There are communal toilets on each floor and a shower behind the reception desk. Stay here only if you don't have another choice because all things in the hotel are very old and very dirty I could not sleep at all. 200 dirham. (updated Jan 2023)\n2 Hotel Central, 20 Place Ahmad el Bidaoui (Located in the Medina). Located in the Old Medina, this simple hotel is a good budget option. The owners are friendly and have been known to give complimentary cups of mint tea to weary travelers. Keep your wits about you as the Medina isn't the safest area at night. 350 dirham. (updated Jan 2023)\n3 Hotel Guynemer, 2, Rue Beloul Mohamed (ex. Pegoud), 20 000 Casablanca, \u260f +212 522-27-57-64, fax: +212 522-47-39-99, hotelguynemer@yahoo.com. In a time-honored building, most rooms classical style, but some rooms have been refurbished to modern style; WiFi in all rooms. starting at 380 dirham for a single room, breakfast included. (updated Jan 2019)\n\n\n=== Mid-range ===\n4 H\u00f4tel Ibis Casa Voyageurs, Avenue Bahmad, Place de la Gare, Casa-Voyageurs, \u260f +212 22 40 19 84. Check-in: noon, check-out: 11:00. Excellent location right next to Casa Voyageurs train station. Excellent garden in the back, perfect for playing with kids. 600 dirham. (updated Jan 2023)\n5 Hotel Ajiad Casablanca, Angle Rue Kamal Mohamed et Rue Fakir Med. This central hotel has 24-hour reception, free parking and air-conditioned rooms. 800 dirham. (updated Jan 2023)\n\n\n=== Splurge ===\n6 Hyatt Regency Casablanca, Place des Nations Unies (In the commercial district), \u260f +212 22 43 1234, sales.casablanca@hyattintl.com. Check-in: 12:00, check-out: 15:00. You can choose rooms with views of Hassan II Mosque. Has a pool and several good restaurants. Live entertainment in the evenings. 3300 dirham. (updated Jan 2023)\n7 Novotel Casablanca City Center, Angle Zaid Ouhmad, Rue Sidi Belyout, \u260f +212 522466500, H6572@accor.com. A four-star hotel with over 200 rooms, this is a great spot for conferences and people looking for a bit of luxury. Expansive buffet breakfast, although a touch pricey. Located near the Old Medina and Hussan II Mosque and across the street from Gare Port. 1000 dirham. (updated Jan 2023)\n8 Sheraton Casablanca Hotel & Towers, 100 Avenue Des F A R, \u260f +212 522 43 9494. This modern hotel houses 6 bars and restaurants and the popular nightclub, Caesar's. There's also an outdoor pool and a fitness center. 2,700 dirham. (updated Jan 2023)\n9 Atlas Airport Hotel (There is normally a bus waiting outside the airport building), \u260f +212 522536200. A modern 4-star hotel very close to the airport. This is the default accommodation for passengers with missed connections, so the price will most likely be covered by the airline. Food is basic but adequate. Wireless internet is available in a few places in the building, but you have to search for the signal - try the ground floor near the gift shop. Double 1000 dirham. (updated Jan 2023)\n\n\n== Connect ==\nUnsurprisingly, all three Moroccan mobile operators (Inwi, Orange, and Maroc Telecom) are available in Casablanca.\nInternet\n\nInternet access is available in cyber cafes around the city. Service is usually around \u20ac1 per hour.\nMany hotels and cafes have wifi.\nMobile monthly plans usually start from 50 dirham, which includes 5GB.\n\n\n== Stay safe ==\nCommon sense will alleviate 99% of problems; try to look as little like a tourist as possible, do not flash large quantities of cash, and so on. Faux guides are much less of a problem here than in the rest of Morocco and are limited mainly to the area around the Old Medina. It is inadvisable to walk alone in Casablanca at night. Women, as in all Moroccan cities, should dress modestly to avoid harassment (which almost always consists of lewd comments, but nothing physical.)\nPickpocketing and moto-drive-by theft seem more to be a problem here\u2014hide your valuables!\n\n\n== Cope ==\nCasablanca is unlikely to cause North American or European travellers a lot of headache. Plenty of European/American food: pizzas and hamburgers are as frequent as tajines and couscous. In some areas, such as the Maarif and Gironde neighborhoods, seeing a man in a djellaba or a donkey pulling a cart of vegetables are rarities. If even the trappings of Moroccan culture such as these are too much for you, any hotel bar or restaurant is going to be just like home for a few hours.\n\n\n=== Consulates ===\n  France, 1, rue du Prince Moulay Abdallah. \n  Greece, 48 Blvd Rachidi, \u260f +212 522 277-142, fax: +212 522 272-412, grcon.cas@mfa.gr. \n  Romania, 100 Rue des Oudayas, \u260f +212 22 618149, +212 22 618283, fax: +212 22 621195, tissaf@casanet.net.ma.

        "title": "Mumbai",
        "extract": "Mumbai (Marathi: \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 Mumba\u012b, Hindi: \u092e\u0941\u092e\u094d\u092c\u0908 Mumba\u012b), earlier known as Bombay, is the largest city in India and the capital of the state Maharashtra. A cosmopolitan metropolis, Mumbai was built on seven islands on the Konkan coastline which over time were joined to form the island city of Bombay. The island was in turn joined with the neighbouring island of Salsette to form Greater Bombay. The city has an estimated metropolitan population of 21 million (2011), making it one of the world's most populous cities.\nMumbai is undoubtedly the commercial capital of India and is one of the predominant port cities in the country. Mumbai's nature as the most eclectic and cosmopolitan Indian city is symbolised in the presence of Bollywood within the city, the centre of the globally-influential Hindi film and TV industries. It is also home to India's largest slum population and the iconic Gateway of India built on the waterfront of Mumbai Harbour during the British Raj.\nThe name Bombay comes from Bom Bahia (\"the good bay\" in Portuguese), a name given by explorer Francis Almeida. Mumbai is named after the goddess Mumbadevi of the Koli community.\n\n\n== Districts ==\n\n \n \n \n\nMumbai is a city built in successive waves of migrations. The neighbourhoods acquired their character from the communities that settled there first. These neighbourhoods are too numerous to list and there is no commonly accepted way to group these neighbourhoods into larger districts. But roughly, from the south to the north, this is how the city developed.\nThe term Old Mumbai is used here to refer to the peninsular portion of Mumbai, which was the city till the 1940s when it expanded to cover the suburbs in the north.\n\n\n== Understand ==\n\nMumbai is a bustling, diverse metropolis with a flair of its own. The entrepreneurial spirit and pulsing pace of life provide a sharp contrast to much of the rest of India.\n\n\n=== Name ===\nThere has been much debate regarding the original name of the city. Some say the current name of the city Mumbai is the original name; and is an eponym derived from Mumb\u0101, the name of the local Hindu goddess Mumbadevi, and \u0101\u012b, meaning \"mother\" in Marathi. Others claim Bombay was an anglicised version of Bom Bahia, a name given by the Portuguese to mean \"Beautiful Bay\" and later made popular by the British as the name of the Bombay state.\nThe name was officially changed from Bombay to Mumbai in 1995. Although Bombay and Mumbai are both used, people who explicitly use \"Bombay\" are generally non-Marathi speakers whereas \"Mumbai\" proponents primarily speak Marathi. In the West, Mumbai has become more commonly accepted in order to avoid controversy. The city is also fondly called \u0101mc\u012b Mumba\u012b (\u0906\u092e\u091a\u0940 \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908, \"our Mumbai\").\n\n\n=== History ===\nThough the seven islands that now make up the city have a long recorded history like any other place in India, their journey to form the city of Mumbai really started in 1498, when the Portuguese took them over from the Sultan of Gujarat. They built a settlement, forts, and churches (including the strange-looking Portuguese Church that stands to this day). However, they could not make much of their possession and the seven islands were handed over to England in 1661 as part of the dowry of Catherine de Braganza when she married Charles II of England. He wasn't very interested in the islands either, and he leased them to the British East India Company for \u00a310 a year in 1668. The East India Company built the docks, the trading posts, and the fort that would form the nerve centre of the city. They also started off the long process of reclaiming land and joining the islands, an activity which went on until the 1960s.\nThe port attracted industries, and the entrepreneurial communities like the Parsis, Gujaratis and Marwaris (from Rajasthan) migrated and set up trading companies and factories in the late 19th century. Industries attracted migrant labour from different parts of the country. The successive waves of migration shaped the character of the city and its neighbourhoods.\nThe city that owes its existence to the efforts of the British was also the birthplace of the Indian National Congress, which played an overwhelmingly important role in the independence movement. The city whose mills were built by industrialists from across the country is the capital of Maharashtra state, which was carved on linguistic lines for Marathi speakers.\nIn the 1980s, high labour costs and unrest forced the closure of many textile mills and the city went into a decline from which it started recovering only in the late 1990s.  The high population put a strain on the infrastructure. The rail and road network underwent a steady improvement over the 1990s, but because of the magnitude of the task, the roads seemed to be perennially under construction. Mumbai has now reinvented itself as a hub for the service industry.\nIn January 1993, in the wake of the destruction of the Babri Mosque in Ayodhya, a wave of riots swept the city, with over 1,000 people killed, the vast majority of whom were Muslims.  Relations between the city's various ethnic groups have been tense ever since, with several terrorist outrages (see #Stay safe) adding fuel to the fire.\n\n\n=== Culture and attitudes ===\nMumbai is the most cosmopolitan city in India. In comparison with the rest of the country, the city is quite liberal. With a regular influx of immigrants from rest of India, the citizens, popularly known as 'Mumbaikers', have shown remarkable tolerance towards other cultures, making it a true cultural melting pot. However this tolerance has sometimes bowed under external pressures. Between the 60s and 80s, there was resentment about the non-Marathi speakers taking away jobs. The 1991 and 1993 riots between Hindus and Muslims did affect this spirit; however, the city managed to recover from these, once again proudly highlighting true 'spirit of Mumbai'.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nMumbai has three main seasons \u2014 summer, monsoon, and winter (milder summer). The best time to visit is during the winter between October and February. Humidity is also less during the winter, when the climate is pleasant; the minimum temperature is 17\u00b0C and the maximum is 30-31\u00b0C. Summer is from March to May, with highs in the low to mid 30s (roughly 80-90\u00b0F). It is hot and humid during this time. June to September is the monsoon season when the city is lashed by heavy rains. The city gets flooded two or three times and normal life gets disrupted during  this season. Climate is humid pretty much throughout the year because the city rests on the coast.\n\n\n=== Tourism information ===\nState tourism office\n\n\n== Get in ==\n\n\n=== By plane ===\n\nMumbai has excellent connectivity with most of the major cities around the world, including New York, London, Dubai, Singapore, Hong Kong and Kuala Lumpur to name a few. If you are flying from Europe it is generally cheaper to fly from London, and there are many frequent flights available. All domestic sectors are linked to Mumbai, making it the second busiest hub in the country next to Delhi.\nMumbai's 1 Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (BOM IATA) is one of India's busiest airports and one of the main international gateways to the country. Many international airlines and low-cost carriers fly into Mumbai.\n\n\n=== By boat ===\nThane Creek is bustling with ferries to central Mumbai from various cities on the southern and eastern side of the creek, such as Alibag. Ferries from Ferry Wharf also allow cheap access to islands and beaches in the vicinity of the city and Elephanta.\nThere are no scheduled international ferries to Mumbai, however cruise ships dock regularly.\n\n\n=== By train ===\n\nWikivoyage has a guide to Rail travel in India\nHundreds of trains arrive daily from all over India, almost all major cities have a direct connection with Mumbai. Trains terminate at various different stations throughout the vast city, so make sure to note which station is relevant for your journey.\nMain reservation offices are Churchgate, Mumbai Central and Bandra for the Western line and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus and Dadar on the Central line. There are unique ticket windows and quotas for foreign tourists. Bookings and tariffs on train tickets from anywhere in India from Mumbai can be found at the website of Indian Railways. Notice that while all trains are operated by Indian Railways, the Western and Central Lines function independently and reservations can only be made at certain stations.\nThe private luxury service Maharajas' Express has travel packages between Mumbai and Delhi. A high-speed railway from Ahmedabad is under construction and is planned to open in 2027.\n\n2 Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus. Completed during the British Raj in 1888, this architectural masterpiece is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and worth a visit even if you are not catching a train. Formerly named Victoria Terminus it was renamed in 1996 to honor Shivaji, founder of the Maratha Empire. Most long-distance services from Southern India, Eastern India and parts of Northern India terminate here.   (updated Sep 2023)\n3 Mumbai Central railway station. The other major railway terminus in central Mumbai, trains from Western states of Gujarat, Rajasthan and some parts of Northern India terminate here.   (updated Sep 2023)\n4 Dadar railway station. Terminus for trains on the Konkan railway from Goa and Mangalore.   (updated Sep 2023)\n5 Lokmanya Tilak Terminus. Also known under its former name Kurla Terminus.   (updated Dec 2023)\n6 Bandra Terminus.   (updated Sep 2023)\n\n\n=== By car ===\nNational highway numbers 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 17, and the Mumbai-Pune expressway radiate from the city providing links to all parts of the country. The road conditions are generally better than in the rest of India. Distances from various cities to Mumbai are:\n\nFrom other states: Ahmedabad (524 km (326 mi), 10 hr), Bangalore (982 km (610 mi)), Chennai  (1,334 km (829 mi)), Kochi (1,427 km (887 mi)), Goa (583 km (362 mi), 11 hr),  Hyderabad (711 km (442 mi), 14 hr), Mangalore (892 km (554 mi)), New Delhi (1,402 km (871 mi))\nFrom Maharashtra State: Amravati (669 km (416 mi)), Ahmednagar (254 km (158 mi)), Nagpur (824 km (512 mi)), Pune (151 km (94 mi), 2\u00bd-3 hr)\n\n\n=== By bus ===\nMumbai is well served by buses from destinations inside India.\n\nAsiad Bus Service The bus terminal, popularly known as 'Asiad Bus Terminal' on Ambedkar Rd in Dadar east is another hub from where buses travel to Pune at regular frequency of 15 minutes to 1 hour. Buses vary in comfort from ordinary to luxury with airconditioning. Other routes available are Mumbai - Satara, Mumbai - Nasik. The easiest way to reach the terminal is to cross over using pedestrian foot bridge to Dadar East from the Dadar Terminus and walk straight all the way (less than 5 mins) to Ambedkar Rd.\nPrivate Buses There also exist numerous private bus operators who operate a large number of services from/to Mumbai from most major cities like Udaipur, Ajmer, Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Surat, Indore, Nashik, Aurangabad, Hyderabad, Belgaum, Hubli, Bangalore, Mangalore, Trichur and Goa. For Pune, buses depart every 10 minutes. Crawford Market, Dadar T.T., Sion, Chembur and Borivili are the main starting points. Some of the reliable private operators are - National,Neeta, Sharma, VRL, Konduskar, Dolphin, Paulo and Southern Travels.\nThe comfortable air-conditioned blue cabs are available to Pune and Ahmednagar-Nashik from opposite Asiad Bus Terminal in Dadar and Lakhamsi Nappoo Rd near Dadar east railway station respectively.\n ST Buses (MSRTC (Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation)), \u260f +91 22 2307 4272 (Mumbai Central), +91 22 2307 6622 (Mumbai Central), +91 22  2422 9905 (Parel), +91 22 2413 6835 (Dadar). Operates services to Mumbai from various cities in Maharashtra. Mumbai Central is the  most important Terminus in the city. All major cities in Maharashtra and nearby states are connected through Mumbai Central Terminus. The other important ST depots are at Parel, Nehru Nagar-Kurla, and Borivali. You can get buses for all over Maharashtra from these depots. But from Mumbai Central you would get buses any time as well as other State Transport buses. Quality varies. \n\n\n== Get around ==\n\nMost of Mumbai's inhabitants rely on public transport to and from their workplaces due to the lack of parking spaces, traffic bottlenecks and generally poor road conditions, especially in the monsoon. However, do ride in a taxi and auto at least once in the city. Feel real adventure in a vehicle that feels like it might fall apart at a speed over 30 kilometres per hour (19 mph) with a driver who thinks he's Schumacher.\nFor travelling using public transport, you can download the m-Indicator app for Android and iPhone. It contains useful information about bus and train routes, which can help you plan your commute.\n\n\n=== By taxi ===\n\nThere are several types of taxis plying in Mumbai. You can hail a cab off the streets. Virtually all taxis have electronic meters which are somewhat tamper-proof. A taxi driver cannot refuse a fare as per law. If a driver does refuse, a threat to complain to the nearest cop usually does the trick. The minimum fare for 1 mi (1.6 km) or less is \u20b928 (in 2022).\nIf you have extra pieces of luggage, the boot (trunk) of the taxi will not provide sufficient space, one large suitcase is all that will fit there. Hiring a taxi with a top carrier will be better. Top carriers can accommodate up to three large suitcases. Before starting the journey, ensure that the luggage is securely fastened to the carrier.\nGenerally, the only way to call for a standard taxi is to hail one on the street. This will not be a problem if you are within Old Mumbai or Bandra. It will be difficult to find a taxi in the suburbs as they have been out-competed by the cheaper auto-rickshaws there.\nThe maximum number of passengers allowed for a trip officially is four \u2014 three in the back seat and one in the front. Seat belts are not mandatory for taxi passengers and most standard black and yellow taxis will not even have them installed, though expect them in the branded ones.\n\n\n==== Air-conditioned taxis ====\n\nAir-conditioned taxis are premium public taxis and its fare is 20% higher than non-air-conditioned taxis. These taxis are really helpful for tourists and travellers who are not accustomed to the heat and pollution of Mumbai. All the rules of non-air-conditioned taxis apply to air-conditioned taxis too.\nSince the fare of air-conditioned taxis is at a premium, the common folks usually do not prefer to travel by air-conditioned taxis and is primarily used by tourists or business travellers. For the lack of demand, the lack of supply is also expected. These taxis ply frequently but are not easily available in all locations. You can always expect them to be available at tourist hot spots like railway stations, airports, premium hotels, top tourist spots, etc. If you are not travelling through either of the above locations, and you need the air-conditioned comfort, but do not want to go look for a taxi, it is suggested that you move to the next section.\n\n\n==== Private taxis ====\nIf you want a comfortable, air-conditioned ride at a small surcharge of 25 per cent over normal taxis it's best to travel by branded cab services that operate at government-approved tariffs. These services operate in modern fleets with well-trained drivers. You can get them at 30\u201360 minutes' notice, they are clean, air-conditioned, equipped with digital, tamper-proof meters, punctual, honest, and GPS-equipped-monitored, which makes them far secure at any time. If you're using a mobile phone, you receive an SMS with the driver's name, mobile number and car number 30 minutes before the scheduled departure. There is a 25% night surcharge (midnight-5AM). Some can be booked online.\nFollow the queue system to board a taxi. Quite frequently, tourists and new visitors are mobbed by unscrupulous taxi drivers. Most drivers are honest, but the dishonest ones tend to cluster around railway stations and airports where they can more easily find suckers. Unless you are taking a prepaid taxi, always ask taxis to go by the meter. At the start of the journey, ensure that the meter is visible and shows the flag-down fare/meter reading.\nMumbai is also served by various transport network organisations. A lot of tourists and locals alike use services like Uber and Ola Cabs to commute in and around Mumbai. Make sure to read the tariffs in these before you pay. While most of these services do accept cash, a lot of them can also be linked to online wallet (UPI) services like Paytm; as such, overcharging is rarely a risk.\n\n\n==== Tourist traps ====\nOne of the common scams is to charge the night fare rate during the daytime. You should be careful and read the heading before paying. In some cards, the night fare is red in colour and the daytime fare is black in colour.\nThe night charges are only applicable if you board the vehicle during the night hours (midnight to 5 AM). If you boarded the vehicle before midnight, and your journey is finishing after midnight, you are not liable to pay night charges. Similarly, if you board the vehicle before 5 AM and you finish after 5 AM, you are liable to pay night charges.\nSometimes, auto-rickshaw drivers charge the taxi fare and even show you a tariff card which is used for taxi fare computation.\nYou can download the m-indicator app which is available in Google Play Store and iTunes App Store. This app carries the latest taxi fares, auto fares, bus services details and local train timetables.\n\n\n=== By auto-rickshaw ===\n\nAuto-rickshaws are only allowed to operate beyond Bandra and Sion. They are not issued the licence for Old Mumbai. If you are not used to Indian roads, an auto-rickshaw ride can be heart-stopping, death-defying, laws-of-physics-bending.\nBefore departing, ensure that the meter is visible and shows the flag-down reading as 1.00 (on a mechanical meter). If the number is higher, insist that the driver flags it down once again. The minimum fare is \u20b923 (in 2022). The meter remains at 1.00 for the first 1.6 km (0.99 mi) and every 0.10 movement indicates approx 200 m (i.e. 1.50 for every 0.2 km (0.12 mi)). Every auto driver is supposed to carry a valid RTO-approved meter tariff card. You can check this tariff card before paying. The meter also keeps ticking if you are waiting and/or are stuck in traffic. It's quite handy to have a copy of the meter card issued by The Mumbai Traffic Police. All of this applies to mechanical meters, not digital meters. Newer digital meters have started becoming common from 2012 onwards, and they show the exact fare, so there is no need to convert via the tariff card.\nAuto-rickshaws are slower than cars and have terrible suspensions. Pregnant ladies are most strongly advised not to travel by auto-rickshaws since the combination of rash driving, poor suspensions, and horrible road conditions have quite often led to serious complications. The auto-rickshaw is a slow and uncomfortable vehicle and is not recommended for very long distances.\n\n\n=== By bus ===\nThe Mumbai Metropolitan Region around Mumbai is fast developing into a major conurbation. If you need to get to the surrounding cities of Thane, Navi Mumbai or Kalyan, bus services are available.\nBuses run from 5AM to midnight. Selected routes run beyond these timings, but much less often. The average frequency between buses ranges from five to 30 min depending on the route. Fares are reasonable and buses can be travelled during peak hours, unlike trains which are far too crowded. Some trunk routes do get extremely crowded, however. Peak hours also have traffic snarls which may depend on the area traversed and the state of the roads.\n\nBuses are numbered and the final destination is marked on the front in Marathi and on the side in English. Generally, buses around the city and trunk routes would be in the 1\u2013199 series. Buses in the western suburbs would be the 200 series while those plying in the central and eastern suburbs would be in the 300 and 400 series. Services to Navi Mumbai are in the 500 series and buses to the Mira-Bhayander area are in the 700 series.\n\nBrihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) provides efficient and comprehensive services connecting all places of the city and the suburbs. Some services also link the city with the extended suburbs like Navi Mumbai and Thane. Seats are almost always occupied. There are bus stops all over the city. There is usually a crowd and queue. You have to get in through the rear entrance and off at the front. Tickets are issued by a uniformed \"conductor\" after you get in. Special seats are marked for \"Ladies\", \"Senior Citizens\", \"Handicapped\", \"Expectant Women\", and \"Women with infants\". They can get in from the front. BEST has introduced the \"Daily Pass\" (Cost \u20b950, valid on all BEST non-AC buses; Cost \u20b960, valid on all BEST buses, including Air-conditioned bus routes). BEST has launched its app \"BEST Prawas\" for Android, which contains features like live tracking of buses and ETA of buses. You can also purchase BEST bus tickets and passes using the ridlr app for Android.\nTMT (Thane Municipal Transport) operates services in the Thane city and areas around it.\nThe MSRTC (Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation), commonly known as ST, operates services from selected points in the city to the extended suburbs. From Dadar, services to Navi Mumbai and Panvel and from Borivali to Thane are the most prominent. Numerous other important routes are also covered in the MMR (Mumbai Metropolitan Region) by the MSRTC.\nNMMT (Navi Mumbai Municipal Transport) operates services in Navi Mumbai Area, and a few points around. They also have services from Mulund in Greater Mumbai.\nKDMT (Kalyan Dombivali Municipal Transport) operates in the Kalyan-Dombivli Area with a few connections to Navi Mumbai.\nAnother option is to book bus tickets online from Redbus or myticketbuddy, both of which have a choice of a number of large private bus operators all over India.\n\n\n=== By train ===\n\nMost people travel in Mumbai using the Mumbai Suburban Railway commonly referred to as \"Locals\". Mumbai has an extensive railway network, with three lines \u2014 the Western Line, the Central Line and the Harbour Line.\n\nMumbai is a linear city and the Western Line  Western  travels from Churchgate to Dahanu Road via Mumbai's Western Suburbs. The Western line provides north\u2013south connectivity.\nThe Central Line  Central  travels from Mumbai CSMT to Ambernath via Mumbai's Central Suburbs and Thane, with some services running beyond to Karjat, Khopoli, and Kasara. The interchange point between the Western Line and the Central Line is Dadar.\nThe Harbour Line  Harbour  has a common stretch between Mumbai CSMT and Vadala Road. The Harbour Line splits into two spurs, the main one running to Mumbai's Eastern Suburbs and Navi Mumbai, up to Panvel. The Interchange point of this line with the Central Main Line is at Kurla. The other spur of the Harbour Line runs up to Mahim on the Western Line and runs parallel up to Andheri. The interchange stations with the Western line are Bandra and Andheri.\nTrains on all lines start operations after 4AM and close operations between midnight and 1AM. Second-class travel is very cheap. However, it is advisable to buy first-class tickets as the economy class is extremely crowded. First Class can be quite expensive and if four people are travelling together, a taxi might be better.\nThere would always be queues and it would be advisable to buy coupon booklets. Coupon booklet punching machines are available at all stations and the best thing is you will not have to stand in a huge line to buy a booklet. Another option is to buy a Smart card for Railways. It helps you maintain balance like any gift card with an option to refill it once it goes below the limit. Smart card outlets to buy tickets are available at all stations. They are touch screen based and you can simply follow the instructions to buy a ticket for the right path.\nIf you are a tourist, you can buy a 'Tourist Ticket'. It costs \u20b9275 and you can travel in first class compartments of all three lines during the entire day. Ensure the location of the first-class compartment before the train arrives. You may ask fellow passengers or the vendors at the various food stalls. An easier way to spot the location of the First class compartment is to check the station walls painted with red and yellow slant stripes.\nAvoid using local trains during rush hour (first class or otherwise). Rush hour is 8:30\u201310:30AM towards CST and Churchgate and 5:30PM\u20138:30PM in the opposite direction. If you are travelling during rush hour, don't stand near the railway tracks as you will get swamped by frantic. Take no offence if you are pushed and shoved about, as passengers jostle for a spot. As you near your exit station, ensure that you are as close as possible to the train door, as experienced commuters, will begin the mad run to be first on, or off, the car before the car comes to a full stop. If you stand any chance of getting on/off before the train departs, you must be equally aggressive in your focus to exit/enter, remember no one will take offence if you make contact with others, as you wriggle by. Last, but not least, exiting/entering a train before it comes to a full stop is not something to be taken lightly, one misstep can send a person onto the rails with amazing ease! Leave the stunts to the experienced locals.\nThere are special coaches for women in both classes. These are designated by green and yellow slant stripes, spot these stripes on the station walls and you'll know where the ladies compartment is. These are generally less crowded and safer. But very late at night, it might actually be safer to travel by the general coach than the first-class women's coach, as the latter may be absolutely empty except for you. From 11:15PM-6:30PM the ladies compartment towards the northern end is open to the general public. Sometimes they have a cop guarding the coaches, but sometimes they won't. Use your judgement.\n\n\n=== By metro ===\nThe modern Mumbai Metro is expanding rapidly and offers by far the most comfortable rides in the city. As of 2024 its four lines serve only the northern parts of the city and are of limited use to most visitors.  This will change sometime in 2025-26 when Line 3 (Aqua), which runs from Aarey via the airport to Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC), is extended all the way to the southernmost tip of Mumbai at Colaba.\nWhile there is talk of unified ticketing, for time being each metro operator has its own ticketing and app systems.  Fares range from \u20b910-50 depending on distance.\n\n\n=== By monorail ===\nMumbai has India's only monorail system, it has one line and eighteen stations. Underused and derided even by locals as a line from nowhere to nowhere, the fare is between \u20b95 and \u20b911 depending on your destination station.\n\n\n=== By ferry ===\nThese are a few intra-city ferry services:\n\nGateway of India to Elephanta Caves Fast boats and Catamarans operated by private operators. These are moderately priced. This is only way to get to Elephanta Caves.\nGorai (Borivali) to Gorai Beach Low-cost ferry connecting Gorai Beach/Esselworld.\nMarve Jetty (Malad) to Manori Jetty Cheap ferry (by BEST) connecting Manori and Gorai. Also services for Esselworld (Amusement Park).\nVersova (Andheri) to Madh Jetty Cheap ferry connecting Madh/Erangal/Aksa/Marve.\n\n\n=== By car ===\nTravel agents and hotels can arrange private chauffeur-driven cars to provide services. Expensive by comparison with taxis, they are the most trusted, secure, and comfortable way to travel around the city. Driving in Mumbai can be difficult, because of poor driver discipline, but chauffeur-driven services are very reasonable. These can be arranged by travel companies or online from the countries of origin. Car rental agencies also have services in Mumbai.\n\n\n== Talk ==\nMumbai is India's melting pot \u2014 a confluence of people from various parts of India, but dominant are people from the west, then north, and followed by the south. Marathi is the state and city official language used by State Government agencies, municipal authorities, and the local police, and also the first language of most locals.\nHowever, being one of India's largest cities and main commercial centre, Mumbai is now also home to migrants from other parts of India who do not speak Marathi. A local variant of Hindi, with strong Bollywood influence, called Mumbaiya Hindi (or Bambaiya Hindi), serves as the \"lingua franca\". Although almost everyone can understand standard Hindi, you may get an interesting reply from some. Most educated locals will be well versed in Marathi, Hindi and English.\nEnglish is widely used in the corporate world and in banking and trading. In most places, you will be able to get by with Hindi and English, as most people you will encounter can communicate in broken English at the very least. However, expect to hear more regional languages including Gujarati.\n\n\n== See ==\nIndividual listings can be found in Mumbai's district articles\n\nThere is a lot to see in Mumbai, but the typical \"tourist\" sights are concentrated in South Mumbai.\nBy Indian standards, Mumbai is a young city and much of the land comprising the city did not exist until it was claimed from the sea over three centuries ago. It is therefore, a pleasant surprise to find rock cut caves such as the Elephanta, Kanheri, and Mahakali within city limits.\n\n\n=== Colonial buildings ===\n\nThe British built a magnificent city within the walls of Fort St. George, which lies at the southern extremity of the city. Some fine examples of the Gothic revival, Neo-classical style and Indo-Saracenic style are seen within this area. To get the best experience of the city centre, stroll around the wide streets of the area right from Churchgate to Colaba. These areas are all beautifully planned and have wide and clean pavements, unlike the rest of the city. Famous monuments to be seen in this area are the Gateway of India, the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT, previously Victoria Terminus), the Municipal Corporation and Police Headquarters and the Chhatrapati Shivaji Vastu Sanghralaya (formerly, the Prince Of Wales Museum). The famous Taj Mahal Palace Hotel is opposite the Gateway of India. The Mumbai University buildings and the High Court are also excellent examples of colonial architecture in the city.\nThere are a lot of other modern structures to look at in this area. The area known as Marine Drive (right from Girgaon Chowpatty to NCPA) is home to a large number of buildings built in the Art Deco style. Mumbai is second only to Miami in the number of Art Deco buildings. some famous buildings in this style are the Eros and Regal cinemas. The Art Deco and Gothic buildings were added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2018.\n\n\n=== Museums and galleries ===\n\nSome of the India's most famous museums and art galleries are found here. The Kala Ghoda area in South Mumbai teems with them, particularly the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya (Prince of Wales Museum), and the National Gallery of Modern Art. Once again, most of them are concentrated in South Mumbai. Also worth planning a visit is Jehangir Art Gallery, also at Kala Ghoda, displays changing exhibits by notable artists. The plaza next to the gallery also regularly displays exhibits of various artists.\nIn Nehru Complex in Worli is Nehru Centre Art Gallery at Worli is a gallery dedicated to young and promising talent along with established artists. Also within the complex is a permanent exposition, Discovery of India, which attempts to cover every aspect of artistic, intellectual and philosophical attainment of India through ages. The exposition spreads across 14 galleries and reflects true identity of the country. On the other end of the complex, Nehru Science Centre - which has a separate entrance from Mahalaxmi race course road, has a permanent exhibition on 'interactive and exciting' science related exhibits highlighting science principles in fun yet educational way.\n\n\n=== Beaches ===\n\nMumbai isn't known for beaches because they have immensely filthy water! Mumbai has a few beaches, including one in the southern districts. But they aren't that great and the water off Mumbai's coast is extraordinarily dirty. The relatively better ones are in North Mumbai. However, they are a great place to see how the locals spend their Sunday evenings, with various food and game stalls.\nThere are other beaches to be found such as the Girgaon Chowpatty (the cleanest one) in South Mumbai, Juhu Beach in the Western Suburbs and Aksa Beach in North Mumbai. The currents don't seem strong, but particularly in the rains, lots of people die from drowning, so avoid getting in the water (especially at Aksa Beach). A word of advice to women: Mumbai beaches are not the kind you can wear swimsuits to, particularly two-pieces.\n\n\n=== Zoos, parks and gardens ===\n\nMumbai has a justified reputation as a concrete jungle, but there are some nice pockets of greenery within the city. It is also one of the rare megacities to have an entire national park within its borders (Sanjay Gandhi National Park). You will not visit Mumbai for them, but if you are already here, they make a nice escape from the din and bustle. It also houses the ancient Kanheri Caves crafted out of rocky cliffs, which dates back 2,400 years.\nThe city zoo (Jijamata Udyan) in Byculla is a colonial relic and it is surprisingly well-preserved. The animals may look rather emaciated, but the sheer diversity of trees on this lush zoo is worth a trip.\nSome city parks are very well-maintained and combine history as well. The \"Hanging Gardens\" on Malabar Hill offers stunning vistas of the Marine Drive. Opposite the Hanging Gardens, there is another park which is known as Kamla Nehru Park, famous for the striking shoe-shaped structure which has been filmed in various Bollywood movies\nFurther in South Mumbai, the Mumbai Port Trust Garden, is another hidden gem. This is set off a small side street off the Colaba Causeway 2\u20133 km (1.2\u20131.9 mi) south of the main section. Attractive views of the port, the naval yards and sunset.\nIn North Central Mumbai, there is Mancherji Joshi Five Gardens. Mainly used by walkers in the morning, it is a mess in the evenings. But the gardens encircle some historic, art deco residences.\n\n\n=== Markets and crowds ===\nMumbai is probably worth visiting just for its street markets, the hustle of vendors, and the madness of the crowds.\nGood places are Bandra, Khar and Andheri. If you came to Mumbai and didn't give visit to the highly dense and crowded markets, it means you didn't meet the real Mumbai.\nHawkers and street shoppers don't ask for any legal permission and then set their stalls at the places where they see maximum footfall. From electronics items to fresh food, you can get everything at railway platforms, subway and mains streets.\n\n\n=== Modern buildings and malls ===\nOnce the British left, the zeal to wipe away the traces of colonial rule was, unfortunately, not matched by the enthusiasm to build a new city that matched the grandeur of the British-era buildings. Now, while the shabbiness of the socialist era is thankfully being replaced by architecture with an eye on aesthetics, the new malls, multiplexes, and office buildings that are coming up are indistinguishable from those anywhere else in the world. Still, they are worth a look, especially if you want to have a look at India's success story. Skyscrapers exceeding 60 stories now dominate the skyline.\nFor long, Inorbit Mall was the only mall offering a lot of variety for shoppers. Palladium, built within the High Street Phoenix, broke the monopoly of Inorbit Mall. From state of the art interiors to international brands, the Palladium has everything. The new Infiniti Mall (Infinity 2) in Malad also has lots of foreign brands and is one of the biggest malls in the suburbs.\nNirmal Lifestyles Mall in Mulund and Metro Junction Mall in Kalyan are two of the largest malls in Mumbai.  In the central suburbs, they are quite popular in the city. The Phoenix Marketcity Mall is the largest in the city, located in Kurla. There is also the R CITY Mall in Ghatkopar.\nPowai is a modern central Mumbai suburb with European looks. Powai houses the Indian Institute of Technology and is built around fabulous lake. Most of the construction is in a township format and is privately built. It houses twenty top of the line restaurants, two large convenience stores, a handful of coffee shops and entertainment areas. Initially built as an upmarket self-contained township, Powai has now grown into a business process outsourcing hub in Mumbai. The township reflects both characteristics; you will often find families shopping and twenty somethings hanging out in tables next to each other.\n\n\n=== Religious places ===\nMumbai has temples, mosques, churches, Parsi agiaries, and even a few synagogues reflecting the diversity of its citizens. While these are naturally of interest if you are a believer, some, like the Portuguese church at Dadar are worth visiting just for their unique architecture.\nMahalaxmi temple is located on the shores of the Arabian Sea, offering a scenic and serene view to the devotees and visitors. \nSiddhivinayak temple of Mumbai is very famous. It is in Dadar and you can easily get a taxi to go to the temple from the Dadar railway station.\nThe city also boasts of Jewish places of worship predominantly in the area called Byculla, but also in South Mumbai. In this area the three prominent Jewish groups of Mumbai lived. They were Baghdadi Jews, Bene Israelis and the locals who had converted over a period of time and lived in the hinterland.\nThere are two very beautiful Hare Krishna (ISKCON) temples that are significant tourist attractions. One is in Hare Krishna land, Juhu, Andheri and the other in South Mumbai, near Gandhi's house. Both have Govinda's pure vegetarian restaurants at the premises. Most tourists appreciate the peaceful experience in the temple.\nThe Islamic Research Foundation of Zakir Naik is in South Central Mumbai near Dongri. Is popular with people of all faiths. It hosts a vast library of books from all world religions and is a great place to hangout and know about Islamic culture.\nMount Mary Church, also known as Basilica of Our Lady of the Mount, is a Roman Catholic church located in Bandra West, Mumbai. \nHaji Ali Dargah is  one of the most visited places in Mumbai. The Dargah Sharief is built on a tiny islet 500 metres from the coast, in the middle of Worli Bay, in the vicinity of Worli. People from different religion and places visit this places. More than 80,000 people visit dargah every week.\nOne notable monument in Northwest Mumbai is the Global Vipassana Pagoda in Gorai. It is a meditation centre that can seat 8,000 people. Vipassana literally means mediation, and the centre runs 10-day meditation courses and 1 day mega courses on Sundays. The courses are free of cost but you would have to register for them in advance on their website.\n\n\n== Do ==\n\nThere is a lot to do in Mumbai, but lack of space means that for outdoorsy activities, you need to head north, often outside city limits. In North Munbai and Thane, you will find opportunities for water sports like H2O at Girgaon Chowpatty. There are two golf courses in the city, the more famous one in Chembur in the Harbour Suburbs.\nMumbai has a vibrant theatre scene with plays in many languages including English, Hindi, Gujarati, and Marathi. While South Mumbai has frequent performances, the best organised theatre effort is at Prithvi theatre, Juhu in the Western Suburbs.

While not a patch on the Sabhas of Chennai, you will find frequent performances of Carnatic music in Shanmukhananda Hall, Matunga in North Central Mumbai.\nMumbai is also usually the first stop for Western pop and rock stars visiting India, which they usually do when they are over 50.

Some of the popular Hollywood screening cinema halls in South Mumbai are Eros opposite Churchgate, Metro on M.G.Road, Regal in Colaba, Sterling next to CST Station, and New Excelsior in Fort.

At the lower end of the spectrum are street vendors. Existing at the borderline of legality, entire streets have been given over to these hawkers and in many places it is impossible to walk on the footpaths, because they have blocked the way.

There's nothing like taking a local along to shop for you.\n\nFamily-run shops, Or one could do shopping at family-run shops, where the items are behind the counter and one has to ask the salesperson to get items from the list.

Many of these roadside book shops can be prominently found, among many, near Flora Fountain, Maheshwari Udyyan (former King's Circle) and Dadar west market.\nIf you are somewhere in the Western Suburbs, Granth on Juhu Road could be a good bet to find the book you are looking for.\nThe Crossword chain of book shops has an outlet in most malls around the city, as well as the main store in Kemp's Corner.\n\n\n=== Tourist traps ===\nIn a place without clearly displayed price tags (and sometimes even in places with), you will get charged about 3-4 times as much as a local if you seem like a tourist. Take a local with you if you're going to local markets to haggle. Haggling is much louder and ruder in India than elsewhere. Don't be afraid to haggle things down to 1/4 of the asking price. And most importantly remember that almost all stores that sell carpets, jewelry, handicrafts, etc. pay huge amounts of commission (25% up to even 50%!) to the cab drivers, hence avoid tourist taxis, cabs, etc. Another thing to remember is not to haggle just for the fun of it. The shopkeepers may take offence if you don't buy an item after they have agreed to your price. One of the places that you can trust is The World Trade Centre (in Cuffe Parade, near Hotel Taj President). Besides being the only World Trade Centre in Mumbai, this place has an amazing range of exquisite carpets, handicrafts, shawls, etc. with reputed government approved stores and state emporiums too.\nAsk for receipts everywhere, including bars, and check what you have been charged for.\nDon't ever accept a guide offer or escort of somebody from the street: You will certainly get conned.\nIf some place (including taxis, restaurants, shops, etc.) claims it doesn't have change (this is highly unlikely), insist they get change from a neighbouring shop.\n\n\n=== Groceries ===\nIn addition to the local grocery stores which can be found on most of the streets, there are new additions to the city in the form of new big and small supermarkets and hypermarkets where you can get all the food items you need. Some of them are Reliance Retail, Star Bazaar, DMart, Spinach Local, Apna Bazaar.\n\n\n== Eat ==\n\nThe dining experience at an upscale restaurant in Mumbai is more or less the same as anywhere else in the world. You can find cuisine from the Middle East, Western Europe, North America and China easily. But to get a real flavour of what's unique to Mumbai, you will have to go a little lower down the scale and experience the street food and Irani cafes. Since March 2015, beef is banned in Maharashtra, and therefore in Mumbai. Therefore, it is uncommon to find beef served in restaurants. For individual restaurants and other places to eat, go to the individual district pages.\nDon't leave Mumbai without trying:\n\nAlphonso Mangoes during summer season\nAs many different kinds of chaat (Bhelpuri, Pav Bhaji etc.) as your stomach can handle\nBread Maska (Bread & Butter) from an Irani Cafe\nGoan seafood\nMaharashtrian, Gujarati, Managlorean special, and Kerala Thali\nIndian Chinese\nIndian sweets: milky, delicious concoctions (try the kulfi falooda at Badshah's in Crawford market)\nKebab rolls, Pattis, Keema\nParticularly late-night at Bade Miyaan's behind the Taj near Colaba Causeway (also if the lights are off in order to avoid bribing the cops, do still try and approach it as it is likely to still be serving)\nKingfisher Blue beer (not common in eateries, but only most \"wine shops\" (liquor stores)\nSouth Indian food from an Udupi restaurant\nVada pav (the Indian veg burger): known to be the dish of Mumbai\n\n\n=== Speciality restaurants ===\nPopular search engines to find restaurants easily include Justdial, AskLaila and DizyLocal. The search engines shall provide the address, contact details, and user ratings (if available) of the specific eatery (if name is provided), or list of eatery catering to the specialty (e.g. Seafood, Pubs, Chinese Food, etc.) depending on the location suggested (e.g. Worli, Bandra, South Mumbai, etc.).\n\n Seafood, Apurva (Fort right off Horniman Circle). If you want to eat some authentic Indian (Konkan) seafood you must visit the Bharat Excellensea. It is next to the Horniman Circle and the Reserve Bank of India. It is becoming pretty expensive. In the slightly higher price range, Trishna (at Kala Ghoda in Fort) and Mahesh Lunch Home (also in Fort) are very popular among both locals and tourists.\nNorth-Western\n\nPeshawari, Andheri, (at Maratha Sheraton). Its sister restaurant Bukhara in Delhi has been recognised as the best Indian restaurant around the world. Try tandoori jhinga, the kebab platter, sikandari raan (leg of lamb), and mangoes and ice cream (only during summers), Kebab Corner (Hotel Intercontinental), Copper Chimney (Worli) Khyber (Kala Ghoda), and Kareem's Malad Link Road in Malad W.\n\n\n==== International Cuisine ====\n Chinese, India Jones, (Hilton Towers Mumbai), Mainland China (Saki Naka), Ling's Pavilion (Colaba), Golden Dragon (Taj Mahal Hotel), Great Wall (Renaissance), Spices (JW Marriott), China Gate (Bandra), China White (Bandra). Bandra offers a range of Chinese Restaurants. Royal China at VT (behind Sterling Cinema serves some of the best DimSum the city has to offer). The new CG83 at Kemps corner is brilliant and the signature restaurant of Nelson Wang. Also new is Henry Thams. The food is brilliant as are the prices, however the bar is much more popular than the restaurant.\n Combination Oriental, India Jones (Hilton Towers Mumbai), Pan Asian (at Maratha Sheraton), Seijo, and Soul Dish (Bandra), Joss (Kala Ghoda) has some of the best East Asian food in the country and at moderate prices (compared to hotels). San Qi at the Four Seasons (Worli) combines East Asian and South Asian cuisine quite well.\n Italian, Shatranj Nepoli (Bandra, Union Park), Little Italy (Juhu next to Maneckji Cooper school), Don Giovanni's (Juhu, opposite JW Marriott), Mezzo Mezzo (at the JW Marriott), Vetro (at The Oberoi, Mumbai), Celini (at the Grand Hyatt), Mangi Ferra (Juhu), Taxi(Colaba), Spaghetti Kitchen (Phoenix Mills, Parel).\n Japanese, Wasabi by Morimoto (Taj Mahal Hotel, Colaba) is Mumbai's best and most expensive restaurant, but Japanese food is on the menus of most Pan Asian restaurants like Tiffin (The Oberoi, Mumbai), Pan Asian (Maratha Sheraton), India Jones (Hilton Towers Mumbai), and Spices (JW Marriott), Origami (Atria Mall Worli). Also Japengo Cafe at CR2 Mall in Nariman Point serves up some sushi. Tetsuma, adjacent to Prive (probably best nightclub in town) serves an average sushi but other dishes are worth a try. Best to go there for a cocktail and a few starters. 'Tian cafe' at Juhu is also a good place for sushi.\nLebanese Food, Picadilly, at Colaba Causeway, the only restaurant in the city serving Lebanese food. Alcohol is not served.\nParsi, Their ancestors originating from Iran, the Parsis are a special community of people that one would associate Mumbai with. Parsi food is based on ancient Persian cooking. Go to Brittania at Ballard Estate or Jimmy Boy close to Horniman Circle.\nSushi, Sushi Caf\u00e9 (Santa Cruz West). A cosy little place. The decor, including the furniture, is all-white. You get chunks of white rice rolled with fresh fish and vegetables. They also do home delivery all over Mumbai. Sushi Caf\u00e9, Shop No. 1, Ground Floor, Sainara Building, corner of North Avenue and Linking Road, Santa Cruz (West), Tel: 98336\u201350503, www.sushicafemumbai.com.\n\n\n=== Street food stalls ===\n\nSongs have been written about Mumbai's street food and you will find that the hype is justified. You will find them at every street corner, but they are concentrated in beaches and around railway stations.\n\nBhelpuri stalls, Selling what in the rest of India would be called chaat. In Mumbai itself, the term chaat is rarely used.\nBhurji, Either Egg bhurji or Paneer bhurji, a mash of eggs and chopped tomato, onion, chili, and lots of oil. Eaten on the side with some pav. Try the Maker Chamber area (near Crossroads 2, Nariman Point).\nChinese food stalls, You'll find them at many places, but they are particularly concentrated near Dadar railway station. They all have a typical Indian twist added to it, which is why it is frequently called \"Indian Chinese\". Although it is great tasting, the hygiene of these places leaves a lot to be desired.\nRolls, Essentially different meat and cheese grilled and served with some Roti and spice, these are cheap and cheerful for anyone with a stomach that can handle it. They are known to be spicy so always ask them to make it mild. Try Ayubs (Kala Ghoda), Bade Miyan (behind Taj and near Colaba Causeway), Khao Gulli (Food Lane, near Mahim Hindu Gymkhana), or Kareems (Bandra). All are particularly busy after a night of heavy drinking.\nSandwich stands, Uniquely developed in Mumbai, you won't find anything like it anywhere else in India or the world.\nVada pav stands,  Fried potato stuffed in yeasty bread. Developed to provide nourishment to mill-workers in Mumbai's burgeoning mills. Now they are found everywhere, particularly in the railway stations. This is a Mumbai specialty. In Vile Parle (West), try the one off S.V Road near Irla across from Goklibai School. One of the most popular ones are opposite Mithibai College which is about 15 mins walk from Vile Parle Station. Also try the one outside Grant Road Station and Churchgate Station.\nTip: cheap and tasty food stalls are concentrated around the city's colleges.\nStreet stall food in India is fantastic, and very cheap. However, do consider well what you are putting in your mouth. Almost certainly the water used is non-potable, street vendors don't seem to understand much about hygiene or hand-washing, and food safety standards are low, with flies buzzing over everything. Even locals steer clear of street food during the monsoons, when diseases run rampant. If the stall seems very clean, and if it clearly states that it is using Aquaguard or mineral water, go for it.\n\n\n=== Authentic Marathi cuisine ===\nIndividual listings can be found in Mumbai's district articles\nMumbai, being home to a large ethnic Marathi community, has its share of notable restaurants that offer authentic Marathi cuisine. Most offer both snacks and regular dining. Some of the snacks to check out are Sabudana Wada, Batata Wada, Missal, Kanda Poha, Uppit (or Upma), Shira, Alu Wadi, Thalipith, Zunka Bhakari,ghavane (neer dosa) and many more. Two notable appetisers are Kokam Sarbat and Solkadhi which are best enjoyed during hot summers. People say that many of these authentic Marathi restaurants are finding it difficult to survive competition with other modern or fast food-type restaurants, but you will find Gajali, Malvan Kinara, Sindhudurg and many more have retained their own charm and clientele.\n\n\n=== Udupi restaurants ===\nIndividual listings can be found in Mumbai's district articles\nMangalorians (and Udupi) form the highest tourist populations of Mumbai, and both cities have similar culture and architecture.\n\"Udupi\" restaurants (or \"hotels\") are everywhere. They bear the name of the town of Udupi in Karnataka, but do not be misled into thinking that they specialise in the cuisine of Udupi. They serve pretty much everything, and that is their specialty.\nUsually strictly vegetarian, these restaurants were opened by migrants from the district of Dakshina Kannada in Karnataka (of which Udupi is a part), to satisfy the palates of other migrants from the district. Over time, they gained popularity as places to have South Indian food. As the tastes of their customers evolved, so too did their menus, so much that now you can find Mughlai, Indian Chinese, Bhelpuri, and other chaats in addition to South Indian stuff. Amazingly, some places serve imitations of pizzas, burgers, and sandwiches too!\nThey are fast food joints and sit-down restaurants combined. The reason to visit them is not to experience fine gourmet dining, but to have cheap, passably tasty and fairly hygienic food. There is no easy way to identify an Udupi restaurant; they are not a chain of restaurants and they may not have \"Udupi\" in their name, so you will have to ask.\nMatunga (Central line) has the best south Indian fare in Mumbai. There are few restaurants which could well be heritage sites as they are more than 50 years old and still retain their old world charm (and furniture).\n\n\n=== Irani cafes ===\nIndividual listings can be found in Mumbai's district articles\nIrani cafes are Persian styled cafes opened by 19th century Persian migrants from Iran. These cafes have a unique lazy atmosphere, display of day-to-day accessories including toothpastes behind the cashier, soaps and what nots (specially targeted at bachelor crowds) and furniture. Most of these cafes were at the corner of the road or building and were chosen spots by commuters to spend time. It was quite a usual sight to find people spending hours reading newspapers over a cup of tea for hours in these places. Sadly the new restaurants and fast food culture has almost removed these cafes from the maps, though few notables like Kyani & Co. and Olympia remain. The joints are best known for their \"Irani Chai\", \"Bun-Maska/Maska Pav\" (bread and butter) and Egg Omelette. Also are popular their assorted snacks, like Kheema-na-Patice, samosas, mava-na-cakes, etc. One of the best dish which is almost always on the menu is Kheema (prepared from ground meat) and pav (bread). Don't miss the Mawa Cake at Merwan & Co, a bustling Irani cafe next to Grant Road station and be there before 9AM when the delicious cakes tend to run out.\n\n\n=== Thalis ===\nIf you order a thali (translated as \"plate\"), you get a complete meal arranged on your plate, with a roti or chappati, rice, and many different varieties of curries and curd. Ordering a thali is a popular option when you are hungry and in a hurry as it is usually  served blazingly fast. Most mid-level restaurants have a thali on the menu, at least during lunch hours. Occasionally, they are \"unlimited\", which means that some of the items are all-you-can-eat. The waiters serve them at your table.\nOf course, you find many varieties of them, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian. There is the South Indian thali. The \"North Indian\" thali translates to Mughlai or Punjabi. Do try Gujarati or Rajasthani thalis if you can find them. They are sinfully filling and tasty. Rajdhani (At Crawford Market) serves up thalis in the Rajasthani style while Aram (near Mahim Church, Mahim), Ramanayak Udipi (At Matunga Station, east) serves up thalis in South Indian style and Shree Thakker Bhojanalaya (off Kalbadevi Road) do filling and fabulous Gujarati thalis.\n\n\n=== Fast food chains ===\nWestern fast food chains like McDonalds, Subway, Pizza Hut, Dominos, Kentucky Fried Chicken etc. have many outlets all over the city. But if you are a weary Westerner looking for the taste of the familiar, be warned that all of them have rather heavily Indianised their menus, so you will find the stuff there as exotic as you found Bambaiyya food. There are chains serving Indian food such as Jumbo King whose menu includes vada and lassi. Barista, Cafe Coffee Day, and Smokin' Joe's are all Indian chains, although they don't serve Indian food. While Barista and Cafe Coffee Day, as their names suggest, serve coffee and pastries, Smokin' Joe's serves decent pizzas and is headquartered in Carmichael Rd, Mumbai. International coffee chains like The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf, Aromas have outlets in Mumbai.\nNaturals is a chain of ice cream stores that serves up tasty and unconventional flavours of ice creams. Try their tender coconut or the coffee walnut ice creams. Its main branch is in Juhu in the Western suburbs (hence the tagline - 'Ice cream of Juhu Scheme'), but it has franchises at many places including Marine Drive, Bandra, Nepean sea road, etc. Naturals is also famous for its seasonal \"Sitaphal\" or Custard Apple Ice-cream. Baskin-Robbins is an international ice cream chain having its presence throughout the city. Also there are a number of shops in malls amongst other places which serve Italian Gelato ice cream.\nTry the sumptuous creamy crepes and omelets at Crepe Station, Bandra. It's owned by a famous Bollywood actor, Dino Morea.\n\n\n=== What to eat ===\nAsking a local for suggestions is a fun way to try new things. Here are a few suggestions:\n\nBhel Puri & sev puri, A classic Mumbai concoction, bhel-puri (or bhel for short) consists mostly of puffed rice and assorted spices with a few chutneys. You can specify whether you want it spicy or bland and the vendor will make it for you. It is quite tasty and again ought to be had off the streets to get the real flavour. Most people like to flock to Juhu Beach to try this out.\nHapus (Alphonso) mangoes, A must try, if you happen to be in Mumbai in the summer.\nIndian-Chinese, Nothing like regular Chinese food. For a typical Bambaiyya flavour, try the Chinese Bhelpuri!\nMewad ice cream, If you happen to be in Mumbai, it is recommended you avoid ice creams from the famous and expensive parlors and try out the cheap Mewad ice cream stalls. They are a lovely treat at their price and provide a lot of options. The vendors are found everywhere across the streets, but avoid those who appear unhygienic.\nPani Puri, The vendor hands you a plate. Next he takes a puri (it looks like a golf ball, but brown in colour), makes a small hole in it, and dips the puri into two jars. These jars contain water, one tangy on a tamarind base and the other spicy on a mint base. He tops it off with some condiments and places the puri on your plate. You pick it with your hand and pop the whole thing into your mouth. To avoid stomach problems only buy from vendors using packaged water.\nPav Bhaji, Part of the street food culture, this is mashed vegetables cooked in spices, topped with butter and served piping hot with pav. Widely available.\nVada Pav, the vada is a mashed potato patty. Pav is a kind of bread that has its roots in Mumbai. (The word comes from the Portuguese word \"p\u00e3o\", for bread). The potato patty is sandwiched in the bread. Liberal helpings of three kinds of chutneys are added to the sandwich to make a tasty snack. It is widely available on the streets and generally costs around \u20b96 a piece. If you feel uncomfortable with the hygiene of a particular stall, avoid it. In that case eating at Jumbo King Vada Pav outlets, found almost at all train stations in the city, is a hygienic and safer option.\nVariations of world cuisine such as Tandoori Chicken Pizzas, the Bombay Masala Pizza or McAloo Tikki burgers.\n\n\n=== Tipping ===\nTipping is not expected, but would be appreciated. However, if a place includes service charges on the bill, you don't need to leave an extra tip. Note the difference between service tax and service charges. Service tax goes to Government and not to the staff.\n\n\n== Drink ==\n\n\n=== Pubs & bars ===\nIndividual listings can be found in Mumbai's district articles\nA police crackdown (June 2012) on many popular bar and clubs is underway, so be cautious when visiting lower to mid range bars.\nMumbai is one of the most liberal cities in India when it comes to attitudes to alcohol. Bars exist at virtually every street corner and many of them advertise themselves as \"family\" bars and restaurants, which indicates that they are primarily restaurants where one can also have a drink. Other places are primarily bars, some of them might be sleazy. In South Mumbai and in the Western Suburbs, you are likely to find many places where foreigners hang out.\nMumbai is much more accepting of women drinking than the rest of India. A woman ordering a drink is unlikely to raise eyebrows even in mid-range bars, though if you are alone, you might need to look out for your safety.\nNightlife in Mumbai spans the gamut from performances at five star hotels to discos. Dance bars which involve young, fully clothed women dancing mostly to Hindi film and pop music, have been shut down by the government for \"corrupting the morals\" of those who frequent those places. While the state high court has ruled that the crackdown was illegal, it will be a while before they open again as there are some technicalities involved to be sorted out.\nIn Mumbai, alcohol is much more easily available than many cities in India.\n\n\n=== LGBT options ===\nThere is already a lively late night, if somewhat subterranean, scene for gays, as well as social and political networks. However, you need to do your homework before arriving, as LGBT gathering spaces and organizations are not published or available at local newsstands. However, Bombay Dost (Bombay Friends) the only magazine catering to the community, after 7 years of running was closed and relaunched in 2009. Much of Mumbai's LGBT scene is coordinated using social networking sites and groups. Use extreme caution; robberies, hustlers, and even police entrapment are not unheard of.\n\n\n=== Coffee shops ===\nThere many coffee shops in and around Mumbai. Try the Cafe Coffee Day and Barista chains. Also, three Starbucks stores were opened in Mumbai in late 2012, and more are likely to follow. These are the best around town and also serve some pretty neat coffee for cheap. There's the Cafe Mocha chain of coffee shops which also serve fruit flavoured hookas \u2014 South Asian smoking pipes. If a small coffee and cookies place is what you are looking for, try Theobroma, it has an outlet at Cusrow Baug in Colaba. Those looking for a more native form of coffee can try the filter coffee, a milky coffee with origins from South India, from any Udupi restaurant.\n\n\n== Sleep ==\n\nIndividual listings can be found in Mumbai's district articles\nIt is very difficult to find good-budget hotels in Mumbai. If you are a tourist or a business traveller, you may have to stay in South Mumbai, which is where both the business district and the touristy areas are. Lack of space means that even the cheapest hotel charges stratospheric tariffs. The state of public transport and traffic means that it is not really a good choice to stay anywhere else. In any case, things aren't much better if you are looking for hotels close to the airport. You should be looking at the Western Suburbs in that case. There are many guest houses at Colaba, where you find most of the budget foreign travellers stay. Other budget hotels are found near railway stations, such as Dadar or Santacruz, but most of them are absolute dumps. One safe and economical place to stay in Mumbai is the YMCA. Reasonably priced accommodations are available at the Colaba, Bombay Central, Andheri and CBD Belapur Branches.\nOne inexpensive alternative is to live with a local family as a paying guest. A list of available families can be obtained from the Government of India tourist office (+91 22 2220 7433) opposite Churchgate  Western .\nOn the other hand, if money is of no object, you can stay at the Taj in Colaba (the oldest in India), the Leela Kempinski, the ITC Grand Maratha, or the JW Marriott Mumbai, Renaissance Mumbai Hotel & Convention Centre.\n\n\n== Connect ==\nIndividual listings can be found in Mumbai's district articles\n\n\n=== Landlines ===\nThe area code for Mumbai is \"22\" (prefix \"+91\", if you are calling from outside India). Phone numbers are eight digits long, but on occasion you will find a seven digit number listed. That is probably an old listing. They made the changeover from seven to eight digits a few years back, when they allowed private service providers to offer telephone. Just prefix a \"2\" to the number and it should work just fine.\n\n\n=== Pay phones ===\nPhone booths can be found all over the city. Though they are coin operated, there is usually someone to run the place. (Typically the phones are attached to a roadside shop.) You need to keep putting \u20b91 coins into the slot to extend the talk time, so keep a change of \u20b91 coins handy with you. The person running the booth will usually have them. If you find a booth marked STD/ISD, you can call internationally or anywhere within the country. Fees will be charged according to the time spent and a meter runs to keep track of your time. You pay when you have finished your call. Often it is difficult to find one that is open early in the morning or late at night.\n\n\n=== Mobile phones ===\nCell phone coverage in the city is excellent. There are many service providers offering a wide variety of plans. Among them are The MTNL, Vodafone Idea (Vi), Airtel, Dolphin, Reliance Jio, and Tata Indicom. It might be a good idea to buy a cell phone and use one of those prepaid plans to get yourself connected while you are in the city.\nAll mobile numbers are 10 digits long and begin with a \"9\", \"8\" or \"7\". Do not dial the city prefix for mobile numbers. If you don't get through to a mobile number, try adding a \"0\" before you dial it.\nDue to security threats, in order to purchase a SIM card you will need to provide formal identification.\n\n\n=== Cybercafes ===\nCybercafes are found on virtually every street corner and the rates are quite low. They have probably not kept pace with advances in hardware or software, also data security could be an issue. As a precaution, change your password after you use it at a cybercafe or do private/incognito browsing.\n\n\n=== WiFi ===\nFinding WiFi will be difficult in many parts of Mumbai, however, nearly all railway stations have been upgraded with 'RailWire' WiFi powered by Google that lets you browse for 45 mins at 5-10 Mbit/s speeds. RailWire WiFi requires you to authenticate with your mobile number and OTP. WiFi is also available at most hotels and restaurants. Airport WiFi is provided by Vodafone Idea.\n\n\n=== Postal services ===\nThe Indian Postal service's head office is housed at GPO, a magnificent colonial architecture on its own; next to the C.S.T. railway station. The other main branch office can be found at Dadar (E) on Ambedkar Rd.\n\n\n== Stay safe ==\nUnlike other parts of the country, especially Delhi where rape is prevalent, crime is rare, except for possibly common crime like pickpocketing.\nViolent crime in Mumbai is more or less like any other large Indian city.\nIt is best to err on the side of safety and act according to your local environment. Here are a few basic safety tips:\n\nKeep your money and credit cards safe at all times. Always carry some cash as many places won't take cards.\nDo not openly display \u20b9500 and \u20b92,000 notes in public. The available currency notes are \u20b910, \u20b920, \u20b950, \u20b9100, \u20b9500 and \u20b92,000 and the available coins for tender are \u20b91, \u20b92, \u20b95 and \u20b910. Beware of someone giving you currency notes of any other denomination (though it is very unlikely; as they would have to be exchanged with the Reserve Bank of India; the central bank of India). The Indian government demonetised the old \u20b9500 and \u20b91,000 currency notes in November 2016.\nTravelling in Mumbai is generally safe at any time of the day or night. The risks primarily run if you are not aware of the fares and fare calculations (only applicable to non-electronic and non-prepaid meters). If you travel alone, especially in night, then always see the meter by yourself and then pay the fare. If you are alone, sit in front so that you can see the meter.\nThere have been cases where taxi drivers con people, mostly tourists, by taking longer routes, charging extra for luggage, tampering with the meter and fooling the passenger by exchanging \u20b9500 with a \u20b9100 note within fraction of seconds and making the passenger believe that he/she has handed over a \u20b9100 note. Thus, in order to avoid getting fooled, prefer app based taxi services like Ola and Uber for commuting.\nBeware of pickpockets on buses and trains. Do not put your wallet or other valuables in outside pockets of your bag, such that someone may be able to slip it out without your noticing.\nAlso beware of mobile, chain, or bag snatchers who operate in densely populated places, such as railway stations, busy roads, and traffic signals.\nWomen traveling by train, especially on off-peak routes should travel in the second class where at least a few co-passengers are also found.\nWomen (especially Westerners) should avoid crowded places, you might well get groped. Cases of men pinching or touching women are common in crowded public places, including nicer nightspots. Create a scene if this does happen to you, there will be enough people around that will come to your defence. In general, in Mumbai, if you are ever worried about your safety, make a loud scene. It is an extremely crowded city, and somebody is always around and willing to help.\nWomen should never ever take lifts from strangers. Western women tourists should note that if they visit a disco or pub in Mumbai or India, don't take lifts or even get too friendly with strangers. You will almost certainly get conned, if not worse. Many Indian men presume that if you're foreign you must be easy.\nDon't ever let an auto or taxi you are traveling in pick up any more people, or pull over before your final destination.\nPolice can sometimes be almost as shady as criminals in Mumbai. At night, women should ensure if they are ever stopped by police, there needs to be a female police officer present or they are well within their rights in demanding the presence of a woman cop.\nThink twice about eating food that has not been thoroughly heated. This may be especially true if you're eating street food.\n\n\n=== Emergency numbers ===\n Mumbai Police, \u260f 100 (Mumbai Police Control Room),  1090 (Police Infoline), +91 22 22026636 (D. G.

Outside of major tourist hotels and restaurants, stay away from raw leafy vegetables, egg-based dressings like mayonnaise and minced meat are particularly risky. In short, stick to boiled, baked, fried or peeled goods.\nOpinions on tap water vary, but most visitors choose to stick to the bottled stuff.  Large bottles of water can be purchased at a very low cost.

        "title": "Nairobi",
        "extract": "Nairobi is a city of 4.4 million (2019) on the Nairobi River. It is the political, financial and media capital of Kenya, and a transit point that most travellers to Kenya will pass through. Nairobi is the largest and fastest growing city in Kenya, and one of the largest cities in Africa. It is worth taking a few days to experience this bustling metropolis.\n\n\n== Understand ==\n\n\n=== History ===\nThe word Nairobi is derived from a water hole known in Maasai as Enkare Nyorobi, which means \"cool waters\". Nairobi, which had been a swamp area, was founded in 1899 as a railway camp for the Uganda Railway. By 1905, the city had become the capital of Kenya (then the British East Africa Protectorate), supplanting Mombasa and Machakos, the previous capitals. With the spread of plagues in the early 1900s, the town was burnt down and had to be rebuilt. Having a railway helped it to grow rapidly, becoming the second largest city in Kenya behind Mombasa. Nairobi also grew due to administration and tourism businesses (mostly big game hunting).\nThe British presence led to the creation of big hotels primarily for the British hunters. After independence, some descendants of the British settlers remained in Nairobi and obtained Kenyan citizenship, and today form Kenya's white community. Nairobi has an East Indian community, who are the descendants of the labourers who built the railway and the merchants who set up shop during colonial times. After independence, Nairobi airport became the principal entrance point to Kenya and it still is today, although it has lost some of its importance to Mombasa.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nNairobi has a subtropical highland climate. At 1,795 metres above sea level, evenings may be cool, especially in the June/July season, when the temperature can drop to 9 \u00b0C.\nThe sunniest and warmest part of the year is from December to March, when temperatures average in the mid-twenties Celsius during the day. The mean maximum temperature for this period is 24 \u00b0C.\n\n\n=== Local information ===\nNairobi City Government website\n\n\n== Get in ==\nFor general information about visas and vaccinations, etc., see the Kenya article.\n\n\n=== By plane ===\n1 JKIA Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (NBO  IATA) (is 15 km (9.3 mi) south-east from the centre of the city). Nairobi\u2019s main airport, and one of Africa's largest hubs. Terminal 1A section is linked to Terminal 1B and 1C by walkways both airside and landside. Terminal 1A has a small food court upstairs airside, and there is a Nairobi Java House between the two terminals airside. Terminal 1B is completed since renovations in 2022 and it serves departures. Terminal 1C has very little except for 10 small shops all selling the same souvenirs. Terminal 1A has a two small shops with a better selection of duty-free and souvenirs. There are Ecobank & Cooperative bank & I&M no withdrawal fee ATMs at the airport or at the cargo terminal.   (updated Dec 2022)\n2 Wilson Airport (WIL  IATA). 11 km (7 mi) south from the city's centre, handles some domestic flights and general aviation.   \n\n\n==== Airlines ====\nKenya Airways (KQ) is the national airline of Kenya, and used to be one of the largest and most reputable airlines in Africa, providing extensive connections from international cities including London, Amsterdam, Paris, Dubai, Mumbai, Johannesburg, Antananarivo, Accra, New York JFK (a direct 15-hr flight), and a host of other countries around the world. Due to mismanagement and corruption, the airline has losses of US$120 million in 2019 and US$330 million in 2020.\nOther major commercial airlines to serve NBO include: Air Arabia, Air Mauritius, Air France, Lufthansa, British Airways, Brussels Airlines, China southern airlines, Egypt Air, Emirates, Ethiopian Airlines, Etihad Airways, Kenya Airways, KLM Royal Dutch, Oman Air, Qatar Airways, Saudi Arabian Airlines, RwandAir, Swiss International Airlines and Turkish Airlines.\n\n\n==== Transfers ====\nIf taking a taxi from JKIA, use a reputable taxi. Many are waiting outside to give you conveyance, and the cost should be very near Ksh 2,000 to the city centre; Westlands or places more west or north will be more. There is an official KAA taxi desk just after you exit the customs area, where you can buy a fixed-price voucher, and they will escort you to a taxi. When taking a taxi to your accommodation, do not be inveigled into taking their recommendation for accommodation. Uber or Bolt costs from Ksh 900 from airport to the centre.\nAirport Bus: To the city centre, Airport Bus #34 for Ksh 100 (as of 2023). You get the bus by walking on the road from the international airport terminal to the cargo terminal, or from in front of the Ambassador Hotel on Moi Avenue in the city centre. 6:00-20:00. The bus trip can take 2 hours in bad traffic, and may be inconvenient if you have big luggage.\nThere is no official taxi desk at Wilson, and each airline operates out of its own terminal. It may be difficult to arrange a reputable taxi on arrival, but there are plenty at the kerb.\n\n\n=== By train ===\nNairobi has become much more accessible by rail. Kenya Railways has opened the SGR railway in 2017 linking Nairobi and Mombasa, reducing travel time between the two cities to 5/6 hours. There are both express and slower intercity services, the latter stopping on more intermediate stations. Tickets cost Ksh 1000 for 2nd class and Ksh 3,000 for 1st. The difference between the first and 2nd class is just the size of seats. As the train is very popular it is recommended to buy tickets a few days beforehand. Trains operating on the SGR line call at Nairobi Terminus, which is almost 10 km southeast of city centre. A connecting commuter train to the central station is available. there are now 3x trains a day from Nairobi to Mombasa 1x is a night train.\nAs of June 2023 there is 2x weekly train service from Nairobi from Nanyuki via Nyeri. The train departs Nairobi old central railway station at 09:30 every Tuesday and Friday and takes six hours. The fare is Ksh 200 in 3rd class and Ksh 1000 in 1st class. there is also 1x weekly train from Nairobi to Kisumu every Friday which cost ksh 600/2000 and takes 12 hours.\n\n3 Nairobi Terminus (10 km southwest of city centre).   (updated Nov 2020)\n4 Nairobi central railway station. Central railway station and hub for Nairobi commuter trains services.   (updated Nov 2020)\n\n\n=== By bus ===\nNairobi is the centre of Kenya\u2019s (mostly reliable) bus system. There are many bus companies operating to and from the country\u2019s different cities.\n\nMombasa Use the SGR railway, it take less than half the time of the bus and costs 50% less.\nArusha in Tanzania 5\u00bd hr by Modern Coast. Arusha Shuttle.\nKisumu, Eldoret, Kitale, Kericho by Easy coach.\nKampala 12 hr by Modern coast, Dreamline or Mash Poa.\n\n\n=== By matatu ===\nMatatus (11- to 18-seater minibuses) and shuttles (6-seater cars) are convenient, inexpensive (and often the only) modes of public transport for connecting Nairobi with towns and tourist destinations in the Rift Valley and Central Highlands such as Naivasha, Nyeri, Nanyuki, Isiolo, and Thika. Matatus can be obtained from the River Road area. Extreme caution should be exercised in this area because petty theft is a major concern; avoid showing valuables such as mobile phones, even while in the matatu (see safety section below). The best method of connecting to a matatu is to arrange for a taxi to drop you off and pick you up directly at the location of the matatu that you are boarding or alighting from. If you're boarding a matatu from Nairobi, tell the taxi driver your destination and they will drop you off at the correct location. If you are being picked up, then tell the taxi driver the location you're coming from as well as the matatu company that you are using (your ticket should have the operator's name). It is best to arrange for a taxi from the hotel you're staying at. The price is dependent on the distance of travel.\n\nfrom/to Naivasha (Ksh 300) 1\u00bd hr\nfrom/to Nanyuki (Ksh 700) 11 seat. 3 hr\nPrestige Shuttle, Dubois Road, has 10-seat vans going from Nairobi to and from Nakuru and Kisumu.

Immigration should be processed at the port facility.\n\n\n== Get around ==\n\nBe careful getting around Nairobi. Traffic is very bad like any other major city, but if you use common sense and a local or guide you should be able to get where you want.\n\n\n=== By hired car ===\n\nHiring a car is convenient as it allows you the freedom to explore Nairobi at your own pace. Most rental companies in Nairobi offer self-drive and chauffeured options respectively. You will find that a large fleet of cars available for hire are Japanese: Toyota, Nissan or Mitsubishi. You can hire both automatic and manual transmission. All rental cars are right-hand drive. Hiring a vehicle with a driver or chauffeur is advisable due to the generally lower standards of driving, average to poor road conditions and the overall cost effectiveness of not having to pay a deposit on hiring a vehicle which is the case with a self drive vehicle.\nCar rental prices vary but as of April 2015 the going rates were as follows:\n\nSaloon car, e.g. Toyota Axio NZE, Toyota Fielder, Nissan Wingroad: (4 seater, under 1800cc, FWD) Ksh 4,000 per day.\n4X4 compact car, e.g. Toyota RAV4, Nissan Xtrail, Suzuki Vitara: (4 seater, 4X4 2500cc. AWD) Ksh 8,000 per day.\nLarge 4X4, e.g. Toyota Prado, Mitsubishi Pajero: (4X4 luxury, Jeep 3500cc, AWD): Ksh 16,000 per day.\n7 seater minivans, e.g. Toyota Voxy or Alphard: (7 seater, 2500cc, FWD): Ksh 10,000 per day.\nSafari vans, e.g. customised Toyota Hiace with a pop out roof: (8 Seater, 2500cc, 4WD): Ksh 10,000 per day\nSafari Jeep, e.g. customised Toyota Land Cruiser J70 jeep with a pop-out roof: (8 seater, 3500cc, 4WD): Ksh 14,000 per day.\nThe car rental rates are often determined by the number of days and estimated mileage per day. Some car hire companies will give you a rate that is 50% cheaper but either give you a contract with a clause limiting you to visit the specific locations, an old car or require a hefty deposit. The rates are cheaper if you are hiring the car for a week, a month or are looking for a lease. Most car rental rates include unlimited mileage, PSV comprehensive insurance, theft and damage waivers.\nThe driver and fuel are charged separately with some companies requiring that you hire a driver if you are taking a large 4X4/4WD (e.g. a Toyota Prado, Land Cruiser j70, Range Rover, Land Cruiser VX, Land Rover discovery). The cost of a driver is Ksh 2500 per day inclusive of meals and accommodation (April 2015).\nAlthough a good number of local car hire companies are reliable, you should either take photos of the car before the hire, or carefully note the dents or scratches on the car and agree. In addition, carefully read the rental contract to check for rules on insurance liabilities in case of accident or theft of the vehicle.\nHere are some reliable car hire companies in Kenya:\n\nKenya Finest Tours & Safaris offers reliable transport services especially for landcruiser 4x4 and Nissan Safari Vans.\nNairobi Car Hire offer good services for 4x4 and other categories of cars.\nCentral Car Hire  are a reliable, trustworthy and helpful rental company based in Nairobi. Two-wheel drive and four-wheel drive vehicles are available and are well maintained.\nNairobi Car Hire Services provided by Hire N' Drive Kenya Limited who are very flexible with their rental terms and reliable. They accept credit card payment online with a very credible refund processing system. They also have a wide fleet of cars available at all major airports in Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu, Nakuru and Eldoret.\nElite Car Rental Kenya although their offices are located in Kikuyu Town, they are a reliable car rental company and have been in operation since the mid-1990s.\nAvis Rental the local representative of the global business. Services are dependable with a variety of self drive vehicle options.\nShoor Kenya - Car Hire which offer safari and saloon vehicle hire including drivers at highly reasonable pricing.\nHertz Car Hire are also represented in Kenya and offer pick up and drop off at the international airport in Nairobi.\nFor ease of navigation around town and to the outskirts, it is advisable to use the Google Map. The navigation guide can be combined with other useful apps such as to help you get a better experience. For ease of search and navigation to secure parking lots, you can use Pata Parking, a smartphone app which is downloadable from Google Play Store. The app enables drivers to search and pre-book for parking, with details of location, charges per hour, features of the preferred parking lot, and the number of reservable parking spaces.\n\n Explorer Kenya Safaris, Garden Estate Road. Victory House. 3rd Floor. Apartment 1, \u260f +254 722218260, info@explorerkenya.com. Offering safari 4x4 Land Cruisers and safari vans for use in Nairobi and on safari (updated Feb 2020)\n\n\n=== By taxi ===\nTaxis are neither very cheap nor prevalent. Prices should always be negotiated before the trip, and paid afterwards (only cash is accepted, often with limited change available). This can be tricky as it requires you to be knowledgeable on the market rate price of the ride you wish to take. Typically, taxis can be found parked around hotels, malls, and tourist areas. The taxis tend to be marked with a yellow line on each side. Your best bet is to ask a local or enquire at your hotel.\nThe taxi services Uber, Bolt (formerly Taxify), Little, Mondo Ride, and MaraMoja have become the hired car provider of choice among Nairobi's large expatriate population due to its convenience, cost competitiveness, and higher quality of service when compared to other taxi providers.\nIf you want a pre-arranged taxi with consistent pricing, you can try Davina Cabs. They have cab service in Mombasa, Nairobi, Kisumu and have an office in Eldoret.\n\n\n=== By bus (matatu) ===\nMatatus (public minibuses/commuter buses) are generally used for travelling between downtown Nairobi and the suburbs. Matatus vary in size, between the van sized 14-seat matatus and the larger 50-seat buses. While generally safe, matatus are involved in a high number of accidents every year. Matatus are often overcrowded with more people than seatbelts and therefore can be dangerous if involved in accidents. Because there are no licensing requirements, matatus are often poorly driven, with drivers passing on curbs, speeding, or passing in oncoming lanes while cars are oncoming. On each bus is a conductor who will hang out of the matatu and call out a price (usually Ksh 50-100 as of 2020) and location the matatu is driving. The government banned the 14-seat matatus inside Nairobi to reduce traffic and accidents in town. The best choice is probably the City Hoppa bus service and the revived Kenya Bus Service. Beware of traffic jams on the major highways, not only in the rush hours.\n\n\n=== By train ===\nThere is a commuter rail service from the Central Nairobi Railway Station going to Syokimau Railway Station. Syokimau Railway station is where you take trains going to Mombasa.\nTrain departures from the downtown Nairobi railway station going to Syokimau are at 6:35, 8AM, 9:35, noon, 17:30 and 18:20. From Syokimau the train departures are 6:20, 7:15, 8:50, 14:30 and 20:20. The trip takes 30 minutes. A one-way ticket costs Ksh 50-100 (as of 2023).\nThere are four rail commuter lines in Nairobi:\n1.Nairobi main station from Kahawa which departs Nairobi at 8AM, and from Kahawa back to Nairobi at 9AM.\n2.Nairobi main station from Embakasi Village Station. It departs Nairobi station at 7:20, 9:30, 11:20, 13:30, 18:00 and 18:30 from Embakasi village station back to Nairobi station departs at 7:00, 8:00, 10:15, 12:10, 14:20 and 19:15.\n3.Nairobi main station to Kikuyu station.\n4.Nairobi main station to Syokimau station.\n\n\n=== By foot ===\n\nWalking around Nairobi is fairly easy since the city is small and places are easy to get to. However, there are some areas within the city where tourists should not go, and walking around at night should be minimised.  Thugs are rampant in many areas.  The city centre may be considered safe by some to venture on foot, but it can't be considered a pleasant experience.  Expect to be approached by beggars, touts, etc.\n\n\n=== By cycle ===\nCycling is quite uncommon in the city and most roads are not at all suited for safe cycling. With that said, there are a few protected cycle lanes within the central district and the government are keen to expand them into a small network.\n\n\n=== By road ===\nCar hire from the airport is possible, and fairly painless with prices in line with other African countries. Travelling during the day reduces your chances of getting car-jacked as most car-jackings occur after dark, but even so, carjacking can still happen at any time of day, even with a strong police presence. However, watch out for undisciplined drivers, as they take little regard for safety.\n\n\n== See ==\nNairobi is known as the safari capital of Africa, however the city has still managed to keep up with modernization. Unlike other cities, Nairobi is surrounded by 113 km\u00b2 (70 mi\u00b2) of plains, cliffs and forest that makes up the city\u2019s Nairobi National Park. The city is filled with many things to do during the day and the night. Tourists can have their pick from numerous safaris (wildlife, cultural, sport, adventure, scenic and specialist), ecotourism tours, restaurants, culture, shopping and entertainment. While in Nairobi, tourists can also engage in numerous sports from golf, rugby, athletics, polo, horse-racing, cricket and football (soccer).\n\n1 Kenyatta International Conference Centre (KICC) (Central District). The best place to get that far ranging view over the sprawling, congested metropolis that is Nairobi. You can go up to the saucer-shaped top of the conference centre's round viewing tower and depending on smog and fog, you might be able to see as far as the slums and the national park. Ksh 400, Ksh 200 reduced.   \n2 US Embassy Bombings Memorial Site (Central District). In 1998 a truck bomb blast rocked downtown Nairobi. The US Embassy building had been the target of a terrorist attack, reducing it to rubble and killing 213 people, mostly bystanders, and leaving more than 4,000 injured. On the same day, the US embassy in Dar es Salaam was also subject to a similar attack which killed 11 people and injured 85. 21 people were charged, including Osama Bin Laden. The former embassy site today contains a memorial park, with a monument engraved with the names of every victim. Ksh 30.  (updated Jun 2024)\n3 Westlands by night. Visit the bustling and hip Westlands district, which has turned into the new nightlife centre of Nairobi. Many restaurants and bars line the busy Woodvale Grove and Mpaka Road. A visit to 'Tree house' club is a must if you are looking for a spacious one and crowd outnumbered with expats, rather than the otherwise congested natives dominated ones. Traffic can become hectic, well into the early hours. Security is generally tight and the action spills out from packed clubs into the street. \n4 UN Office at Nairobi (UN Complex Gigiri), United Nations Ave, \u260f +254 20 762 2034, un.tours@un.org. Sitting between the Karura Forest and the US Embassy, it houses international organisations such as the UN Environmental Programme, UN-HABITAT and is the basis of all UN operations in Africa.

This is a museum housing only special exhibits, so the featured artwork is always changing. \n\n9 Karen Blixen Museum, P.O. Box 40658-00100, \u260f +254 20 8002139. Based on Karen Blixen\u2019s book Out of Africa. Her house is now the home of the museum. You have to be accompanied by a guide to visit the house, but you can walk around the gardens on your own. If you're not into the movie, and don't know the history of the house, then it may not be worth your while taking the hour or so it takes, and the price of admission. The house has little remaining original furnishings, but there are some of the props used in the movie here (although the movie wasn't filmed here - it was create on a set). It is on the outskirts of Nairobi (in the suburbs of Karen) and a taxi or bus can get you to the museum. It's not too far from the Elephant Orphanage and the Giraffe Centre, so these attractions can easily be combined in a single trip.   \n10 Bomas of Kenya, Langata/Forest Edge Road, \u260f +254 20 891391. Portrays Kenya\u2019s culture. Visitors can see exhibits of traditional Kenyan homes, artifacts, dances, music, and song. \n\n\n=== Parks ===\n\n11 Nairobi National Park (just outside Nairobi). This is home to large herds of zebra, wildebeest, buffalo, giraffe, lion, cheetah, hippo, and birdlife (over 400 species). Here you can also go on the Nairobi Safari Walk, an educational centre to make people aware of wildlife and habitat conservation. Also in the park is the Nairobi Animal Orphanage.   \n12 Sheldrick Elephant Orphanage (close to the Nairobi National Park), \u260f +254 736 919321. 11:00. They take in orphaned elephants from all over Kenya, and keep them until they are able to survive in the wild. Visiting hours are daily at 11:00, so you should aim to arrive about 10 minutes before that time. You will be admitted and the elephants will be fed in two groups for around an hour. After than there is a brief time to shop and look around, and it closes again around 12:30. If you are willing to sponsor an elephant for US$50, you can make an appointment to see your elephant put to bed at around 17:00. These brief visiting times are to ensure that the elephants are not overly exposed to humans. \n13 Giraffe Centre (in Lang'ata, about 20 km from Nairobi CBD). The centre breeds the endangered Rothschild giraffe and has conservation/education programmes for Kenyan children. It also has many warthogs and leopard tortoise. You'll receive food to feed the giraffes, and get close enough to touch them. Just outside/opposite of the centre is a (free) nature hiking trail which is popular among residents. In August 2021 the centre was undergoing renovations but remained open, though with limited access to the giraffes. Ksh 1500/750 for non-resident adults/children.

Bicycle rental for Ksh 500/2 hours. (Single use) plastic are not allowed. Usually quiet on weekdays but gets very busy on weekends (Sunday). Attractions include a small waterfall and some monkeys. Ksh 600 for non-residents.   (updated Sep 2021)\n18 City Park. The city park is a good place to spend leisure time without any disturbance within an indigenous forest and with lots of sykes monkeys. They are trustful and come close due to being fed by visitors frequently. As they expect food from the visitors they get moody if you have nothing. On weekends and national holidays the park becomes very lively. There are some nature trails, but not really safe for foreign tourists. Another highlight of the City Park is the vegetables and fruits market in one corner of the park near Lumuru Road. Avoid going into the forest when it is dark. It is not safe. The park is not a must go destination, but worth to visit if you have extra time. Entry to the park is free. (updated Oct 2017)\n\n\n=== Religious sites ===\n19 Jamia Mosque (Central District). While Jamia Mosque is tucked away in between other buildings there are striking views to be glimpsed of its intricate structure from many different angles. Easily the most impressive religious structure in the capital, the interior is off-limits to non believers   \n20 All Saints' Cathedral. Cathedral of the Anglican Church of Kenya, built in 1924.

You will see the expansive plantations on your way to the falls. 14 small streams merge to form the big waterfall at the foot of the Kilima Mbogo Hills. These streams are part of the Athi River. At first glance the falls are magnificent; however, the river is strongly polluted by industrial waste and a foul chemical smell and reams of rubbish strewn across all the rocks really ruin the experience. At Thika are the Thika and Chania Falls close to the Blue Post Hotel. That's interesting too for a stop to or from the 14 falls. Also worth a visit are the Mau-Mau caves in which allegedly Maumau fighters hid during the independence battles between Thika and Mangu, about 6 km from Thika Entrance fees for 14 Falls are: US$15 per person, US$5 parking, US$5 per camera. (updated Jun 2017)\n28 Kitangela Glass.

One of the strangest natural phenomena along the Kenyan Rift Valley is the point that the native Kamba mysteriously call \"anti-gravity.\" Young men gesticulate on the street to demonstrate the \"miracle\" to visitors for a small fee. They put a plastic bottle filled with water on the asphalt, which apparently rolls uphill. If you ask them if they gave the bottle a nudge, they empty the contents onto the street. The water flows slowly uphill \u2013 apparently. Those blindly taking a few steps would swear they are going downhill. But the way undoubtedly goes up. (updated Dec 2017)\n31 Swara Plains Conservancy. Swara Plains is a fenced sanctuary where Zebras, Giraffes, Ostriches, Monkeys and many other \"non raptor\" animals can be observed.

Salt lake with hot springs for SPA, soda ash and salt production and many flamingos (updated Sep 2018)\n34 Hells Gate National Park. A nice alternative to the more traditional Safari.

It is a popular walking and picnicking venue. In Ngong is a station where you have to pay the park entry fee, and those who want to also for a guide. There is only one route, the walk from Ngong to Corner Baridi (Kiserian), which takes about 4\u20135 hr; you hardly can get lost. Also organized hiking tours are offered.\nOther nice places for hiking are the Mount Longonot National Park and the Menengai Crater,  a massive shield volcano with one of the biggest calderas in the world, in the Great Rift Valley, Kenya. It is the largest volcano caldera in Kenya and the second largest volcano caldera in Africa\nSafari: Nairobi is the capital of safaris in Kenya. There are tour operators from budget to world class all over the city. Yet it is not easy find the best fitting. For important things to consider when booking see Kenya#Safaris.\n\n\n== Buy ==\n\n\n=== Money ===\nThis may also be a good place to repeat the warning about safety. Pickpockets are rampant in Nairobi and have been known to keep an eye on people getting cash from a machine. It is best to carry cash in a hidden pouch rather than a wallet. Men should not carry their wallets in their back pockets, and women should not carry their purses to the side or behind them, particularly in busy locations.\n\nCredit cards: Many stores will accept international credit cards. all big supermarket chains accept credit cards without a surcharge.\nATM: There are networked banking machines in major shopping areas of Nairobi and in the Nairobi airport. Ecobank. Cooperative Bank, Gt Bank, NCBA, Sidian bank, DTB, I&M charges no fees for withdrawals (e.g. by Visa or Mastercard) through their ATMs. Absa and Standard Chartered Bank, Stanbic, Equity, BOA, KCB have a minimum Ksh 400-700 ATM fee for overseas cards at all their ATMs. Eco Bank has atms in 36 African countires.\nCash: Most transactions are cash only, so it is best to have enough cash on hand to pay for purchases and transport. Cash is dispensed in units of Ksh 1,000. Many smaller businesses will not have much change, so before going shopping for curios be sure to have a good selection of smaller notes.\nForex bureaus are found in many parts of the city where tourists are common. They will exchange cash of different currencies, and may also accept a personal cheque for Kenyan cash. They will want a photocopy of your passport before they exchange money. Rates are not bad, but will be worse than a banking machine will offer. Many exchange bureaus and hotels will not accept or exchange American currency printed before 2000. When the exchange bureaus do accept pre-2000 notes, they typically offer substantially lower exchange rates than for currency printed after 2000. Exchange rates are also typically lower for small denomination currency than for US$100 and $50 bills.\nCashless payment: Another essential phone tool is M-Pesa. It is a mobile phone-based platform used for most money transactions in Kenya. M-Pesa agents are available all over Kenya. You can use the platform instead of carrying cash around for safety purposes.\n\n\n=== Shopping ===\nFor local curios and souvenirs, the most easily accessible and tourist-friendly is the Maasai Market, held on Fridays at the Village Market, an upmarket, open concept shopping centre near the United Nations and American Embassy complexes. Bargaining is necessary, and one should probably not spend more than Ksh 1,000 on one item, except in extraordinary circumstances.\n\n Maasai market, Slip Rd. Go to the Maasai market and buy keepsakes. On Saturday the market is at Nairobi High Court parking lot, village market on Friday, The Junction on Thursday, Capital Centre on Wednesday.

Beware of snatch and grab, con artists, or groups of people following you. Scams are elaborate and can involve up to 10 or more people working together. The best advice for a tourist is to stay in the city centre, know where you are at all times, and pretend you know where you're going (even if you don't). If you find yourself in an unfamiliar area your best bet is to find a taxi (although you will probably pay dearly if the driver suspects a panicked westerner!) Don't carry large quantities of money or passports on the street, and assume that anyone trying to engage you is up to no good or trying to sell you something. If you stay smart and play safe, without going around much after dark, Nairobi can be a safe place to stay. Most locals are honest people who will happily help you if you approach them. The areas where you have to take special care are: Globe Roundabout, Archives, Ambassadeur, Muthurwa Market, around Nation Centre, Landies Road, Nyamakima, Kirinyaga Road, and Uhuru.\nKenyans are proud people and there is not a lot of begging like you find in some other countries. Some opportunistic people will hang around shopping centres and beg, but they will generally accept a simple 'sorry' and leave you alone if you do not give. Many of these 'beggars' are middle-class kids or adults who have realised they can profit from exploiting white guilt, and should not be encouraged. If you are ever lucky enough to visit a slum as a local (not on some perverse tourist safari) you will discover the poorest of the poor do not even beg.\nOutside of tourist and expat communities, young children will become excited at the sight of a white person and may come running towards you to try to shake your hand while yelling out 'mzungu' (white person) or 'how are you?'. Older kids are more reserved, and you should be wary of kids who are older than 9 or 10 who are trying to distract or get close to you.\nSlums should be avoided by tourists as you will attract a lot of attention which can quickly turn into a dangerous situation.\nApart from the inner city centre, Nairobi dies out at night. Streets are mostly empty. Do not walk alone after nightfall. Always use taxis. The areas north and east of River Road should be avoided, especially if you're not a local!\nBiashara Street is a safe shopping street due to the presence of 10-15 Maasai guards. A place to avoid as a tourist is the City Market; you could end up paying a much higher price than on Biashara Street.\nIf you are in a matatu and moving slowly through traffic, particularly after dark, you should keep your window closed if your valuables are in reach to prevent people snatching them from the outside (there are thieves who walk through traffic looking for such opportunities). Mobile phones and wallets should be securely kept and not displayed prominently during calls or cash transactions in the River Road area, particularly after dark.\nEastleigh (known as 'little Mogadishu') is an area near the city centre that is decaying due to years of neglect by the government (including the police). It is predominantly populated by Somalian migrants and refugees, and most Kenyans will not go there for fear of their safety. Tourists would be wise to avoid it day and night.\nThere have been several grenade attacks in the city for which Al-Shabaab have claimed responsibility. These are likely to be ongoing while the Kenyan army has a presence in Somalia. They are random and often fatal, and one should be wary and report any suspicious behaviour. Associated with the terrorist threat, you can expect to pass through security checkpoints with armed guards at most attractions, shopping malls and even on the streets.  You can expect (at times) to have to have your bags searched, and car checked.\n\n\n== Stay healthy ==\nIt is recommended that before tourists come to Nairobi, that they should be vaccinated well in advance (6 weeks) of their trip. The most common recommended vaccines for people traveling to Africa are Tetanus, Diphtheria, Polio, Typhoid, Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, Yellow Fever, Rabies and Meningitis.\n\n\n=== Food and beverages ===\nBe careful with the food that you eat outside the more upscale establishments. Before eating, make sure that the food is freshly and thoroughly cooked and served hot. Also avoid seafood, except at upmarket restaurants and hotels, and make sure that your fruits and vegetables have been properly washed in clean water. The safest fruits to eat are bananas and papayas.\nDo not drink tap water or brush your teeth with it. Only use bottled or canned drinks (especially popular brands). Also, do not use ice as it may also be contaminated water, and remember that alcohol does not sterilize a drink. The general rule of thumb is, the more high end an establishment is, the greater the safety of the food and drink within.\n\n\n=== Insects ===\nIn Africa you are going to be exposed to yellow fever, dengue fever, other viral diseases, sleeping sickness, filariasis and malaria, although none of these diseases is a concern in Nairobi. When insects are biting you should cover up and wear long-sleeved shirts and trousers, socks and pyjamas especially when night falls. It is best to use an insect repellent that contains DEET on your exposed skin and clothing. As for mosquito nets, it is best to use a permethrin-impregnated net along with an insecticide such a pyrethrum coils or an electric mosquito killer during the night. And remember to spray your hotel room every evening.\n\n\n=== Heat and sun ===\nMake sure to drink plenty of fluids (not coffee, alcohol or strong tea) to avoid dehydration. To know if you well hydrated, you body would always produce plenty of clear urine. The average temperature is around 25\u00b0C (maximum might reach 30\u00b0C) throughout the year. People coming from Asian countries like India will not have much problem with the weather \u2014 in fact it will seem pleasant year-round. For people who are from cold countries, it can take three weeks to become accustomed to the heat. Try to avoid plenty of physical exertion and to stay in the shade and keep cool as much as possible. Increase the amount of salt intake in your food and water. Also, apply a lot of high-factor sunscreen, avoid direct sunlight, and try to wear a hat and shady clothing.\n\n\n== Connect ==\nThere are very many internet caf\u00e9s around Nairobi, but connection speeds and computers are not always super fast, but still you will manage to open your email, probably even use a webcam or watch YouTube. Prices are usually at ranges from Ksh 0.5/minute to Ksh 1/minute, usually with a minimum fee of Ksh 5-20. The more expensive internet caf\u00e9s are rarely better and the best ones charge Ksh 1/minute with discounts for using the internet for longer. Most of the good caf\u00e9s are found in Norwich Union which has quite a number just opposite Hilton Hotel next to Nandos while the expensive ones are found in malls in Westlands. Although it may be more appropriate for tourists to use the ones in Westlands since they are usually less crowded and are more exclusive but not necessarily faster or better in terms of equipment.\nFree wireless internet is available at Java House restaurants and Doorman's coffee shops in the city and malls. Some bars like Havana in Westlands also offer free wifi. The internet cafe in Sarit Centre also has wireless internet available at a good speed and a reasonable price.\nMobile phones are ubiquitous in Kenya with fairly good coverage from all providers Safaricom, Airtel and Telkom that extends to most populated parts of the country. Safaricom has the best national coverage especially if you are using 4G data. The phone system is GSM 900 and 3G-4G 2100 (Asian and European standard) on Safaricom, Airtel and Telkom Phones and SIM cards are available at many locations throughout Nairobi and the country including at the airport.  Phone prices are very competitive and priced for average income Kenyans.  A basic phone may be obtained new from an independent dealer for ~Ksh 2000. A vast majority of people use pre-paid phones with scratch-card top-ups available at a huge number of merchants across the country. Phones are sold \"unlocked\" by outlets for use on any network. Safaricom though does sell a number of phones locked to its network. Much business is conducted via mobile phone, so possession of one for even a relatively short stay in the country can be beneficial.  Rates are extremely affordable with in-country calls at around Ksh 3 per minute.  Overseas calls cost around Ksh 5 per minute to the United States (~USD$0.06/minute) and Ksh 3 per minute to India on the Airtel network.\n3G data service is available in most coverage areas on Safaricom and is of a fairly high standard. The other networks have 3G in major population areas and EDGE/GPRS everywhere else. If you have a smart phone you should buy a data pack (200mb, 500mb or 1.5gb) or your credit will go down very fast.\nAirtel and Telekom have lower prices for calls and data.\n\n\n== Cope ==\nSmoking is against the law out on the streets in the city centre (the downtown grid area with numerous skyscrapers).  There are certain smoking zones, and outside of the city centre it becomes much easier to find locations where it is acceptable.  However, a general rule would be to not smoke along the side of any roads or streets with pedestrians and/or vehicles.  Be observant and take your cues from other smokers - if there are no smokers or cigarette butts on the ground, it is likely a non-smoking location.\n\n\n=== Embassies, Consulates and High Commissions ===\n  Australia, Riverside Dr (400 m off Chiromo Rd), \u260f +254 20 4277100, fax: +254 20 4277139. \n  China, Woodlands Rd, \u260f +254 20 2726851, fax: +254 20 2726402, chinaemb_ken@mfa.gov.cn. \n  Cyprus, International House 6th Floor, Mama Ngina St, \u260f +254 20 2220881, fax: +254 20 312202, cyprusnairobi@gmail.com.

        "title": "Hawaii",
        "extract": "Hawaii (Hawaiian: Hawai\u02bbi, sometimes pronounced ha-VAI-ee by locals) is the 50th state of the United States of America. Situated nearly at the center of the north Pacific Ocean, Hawaii marks the northeast corner of Polynesia. While it was once a major hub for the whaling, sugar and pineapple industries, it is now economically dependent on tourism and the U.S. military. The natural beauty of the islands continues to be one of Hawaii's greatest assets. Honolulu is the state's capital, largest city, and cultural hub. Hawaiian and English are the official languages of Hawaii.\n\n\n== Islands ==\nHawaii is an archipelago of over 19 volcanic islands spread over a geological \"hot spot\" in the Central Pacific. The Pacific plate on which the islands ride moves to the northwest, so in general the islands are older and smaller (due to erosion) as you move from southeast to northwest. There are eight major islands, six of which are open to tourism.\n\n\n== Cities ==\nThe term \"cities\" is used here in a broad sense. Hawaii has no organized government below the county level. All communities that would be thought of as cities, towns, and the like in the rest of the US are merely \"census-designated places\", statistical entities established by the United States Census Bureau.\n\n1 Honolulu \u2013 state capital and most-populous community\n2 Kahuku \u2013 on Oahu\n3 Kailua \u2013 on Oahu\n4 Lihue (Hawaiian: L\u012bhu\u02bbe) \u2013 on Kauai\n5 Lahaina (Hawaiian: L\u0101hain\u0101) \u2013 on Maui\n6 Kahului \u2013 on Maui\n7 Wailuku \u2013 on Maui\n8 Hilo \u2013 largest community on the Big Island\n9 Kailua-Kona \u2013 on the Big Island\n\n\n== Other destinations ==\n\n1 Ala Kahakai National Historic Trail on the Big Island.\n2 Haleakala National Park on Maui\n3 Hawaii Volcanoes National Park on the Big Island\n4 Kalaupapa National Historical Park on Moloka\u2018i\n5 Pu'uhonua o Honaunau National Historical Park on the Big Island\n6 USS Arizona National Memorial on O\u2018ahu\n7 Waimea Canyon on Kaua\u2018i\n8 Waikiki on O\u2018ahu\n\n\n== Understand ==\n\nWhere tourism is concerned, Hawaii has something for everyone. The island of Oahu, the most populous and home to the state capital and largest city of Honolulu, is great for people who wish to experience the islands and still keep the conveniences of a large city. Rainforests and hiking trails are minutes from Waikiki Beach, one of the world's best tourist destinations. In the winter, large waves on Oahu's north shore turn the normally sleepy area into the surfing capital of the world.\nOn the other hand, those who wish to experience Hawaii at a slower pace would do well to visit one of the Neighbor Islands (the other, less populated islands around Oahu). All the Neighbor Islands offer opportunities to relax and enjoy the sun and scenery. Many of the natural wonders of the islands are on the Neighbor Islands, from Waimea Canyon on Kauai, to Haleakala on Maui, to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park on the Big Island of Hawaii. Numerous waterfalls and rainforests evoke memories of what the islands might have looked like before major corporations set their sights on Hawaii.  The road to Hana is one of the most scenic on Maui, as you manipulate many turns overlooking the Eastern coast of the island.  It leads you over bridges and past beautiful waterfalls.  You can end up at the Oheo Gulch Pools (which are not sacred and there are more than seven), where the hiking is quite the experience.\n\n\n=== History ===\nPolynesians migrated to, and established communities on, the islands of Hawaii around 800 CE, part of the great expansion of Austronesian peoples that also populated most other Pacific islands.\nCaptain James Cook was the first European visitor to the islands, arriving in 1778. At that time, each island was a separate kingdom. With the support of Western advisors and weapons, Kamehameha I of the island of Hawaii conquered all the islands except Kauai, which acquiesced to his rule in 1810.\nAfter Kamehameha II abolished the kapu (taboo) system, American missionaries came to the islands to spread Christianity. As the Native Hawaiians did not have any concept of owning land, the missionaries became official land owners of many of the islands. Their children became successful businessmen in the Islands and still own entire islands to this day. Pineapple and sugar cane plantations were established, and workers from other countries (in particular Japan, the Philippines, China, Korea and Portugal) were imported as contract laborers. Their descendants also became established as successful professionals.\nThe Hawaiian monarchy was overthrown in 1893 by a group of American businessmen. While the U.S. administration at the time refused to annex the former sovereign nation, in 1898 the United States did annex the islands, which became a territory in 1900, and a state of the United States in 1959.\nHawaii also became an important outpost for the U.S. military through the 20th century, and Pearl Harbor was the site of the Japanese attack on December 7, 1941, that resulted in the U.S. joining World War II (see Pacific War). Today, the military maintains its presence here, with several major military bases on the island of Oahu alone; Pearl Harbor remains the headquarters of the U.S. Pacific Fleet.\nOver the years, many major retail chains have expanded their presence in Hawaii, making the Islands look more and more like the continental United States, often at the expense of local businesses. Nevertheless, Hawaii remains culturally vibrant. Its population, descended from the Native Hawaiians, the original plantation workers, and more recent arrivals, and in which no one group has a majority, is often cited as an example of multiculturalism at its best. There is a strong commitment to perpetuating Native Hawaiian cultural traditions, and the cultural heritage of Hawaii's many immigrant communities from the Pacific, Asia and Europe. And certainly the environment is conducive to longevity. Hawaii has the longest predicted life expectancies of any U.S. state.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nDepending on where you are in Hawaii, the weather can be very different over even short distances. On the same day, on Oahu you might find sun over the beaches in Waikiki and rain only a few miles away in Manoa Valley.\nAlthough the islands receive abundant amounts of both sunshine and rain, rain is more likely on the north and east sides of the islands, which face the prevailing northeasterly tradewinds (the \"windward\" side of the island), as well as the mountain peaks and valleys. The moist tropical air carried by the tradewinds is forced upward by the mountains, resulting in clouds and rain. Rain is less likely on the coastal areas of the \"leeward\" sides (the south and west sides) of the islands.\nAlthough there are no true \"seasons\" in the islands in the same sense as the rest of the U.S., the climate does go through annual cycles based on rainfall. The \"wet\" season in Hawaii (cooler temperatures and more rainfall) runs roughly from October to March, and the \"dry\" season (warmer temperatures and less rainfall) from April to September. There is therefore a higher probability of rain if you visit during the peak of tourist season in late December or January.\nHurricane season in the islands runs from June to November. Although Hawaii's relative isolation means that it is affected only rarely by tropical cyclones, one of the storms or its remnants does hit or skirt the Islands every couple of years, such as Hurricanes Iwa and Iniki hitting Kauai in 1982 and 1992 respectively.\nOverall, Hawaii is warm and balmy \u2014 when you step out of the plane you'll immediately notice that the air is soft and humid \u2014 and during the summer months the tradewinds provide a pleasant breeze. Daytime temperatures generally range from the low 70s (21\u00b0C) in \"winter\" to the mid 80s (27\u00b0C) in \"summer\". Very rarely does the air temperature exceed 90\u00b0F (32\u00b0C) even in the hottest part of summer; however, the humidity will make it feel as if it were a few degrees hotter. Ocean temperatures range between 73\u00b0F (23\u00b0C) degrees in the winter to 78\u00b0F (25.5\u00b0C) in the summer. There is usually no more than a 20\u00b0F (12\u00b0C) difference between daytime high and nighttime low temperatures.\nConsequently, besides your driver's license, credit card, camera, binoculars, and other essentials, it's best to keep your clothes to a minimum... one or two pair of washable slacks/shorts, light shirts, walking shoes, sandals and swim gear. A light jacket or sweater may be necessary depending on when and where you go, but heavy clothing is not normally necessary in most areas. Sunscreen is essential since Hawaii's close proximity to the Equator translates into very strong sun radiation. The suitcase space you save can be used to fill up on island purchases.\nAlthough the above is true for most of the Islands, you will find exceptions. A good rule to remember is the higher the elevation, the cooler it will be. Upcountry areas of Kauai, Maui and the Big Island will be cooler during the day, in the 60s F, and much colder at night, in the 40s F. At the highest elevations on Maui and the Big Island, temperatures can drop to near freezing in places like Haleakala National Park, Volcanoes National Park, and Mauna Kea. On the Big Island, both of the largest mountains, Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa, can receive snowfall year around, mostly in the winter, and can even experience blizzard conditions.\nThere is more of a difference from the day-to-night temperatures in Hawaii than there is summer-to-winter. Given that, there can be more of a difference from lower elevations to higher elevations than either of those, depending on where you are visiting. It's important to research the areas you plan to visit and bring clothing suitable for those conditions.\n\n\n=== Best times to go ===\nHawaii's tropical weather tends to be most attractive to tourists when the weather is frightfully cold at home. It's not surprising, then, that the peak tourist season in Hawaii is the Northern Hemisphere winter (mid-December to mid-April). The highest prices tend to be during the Christmas and New Year's season, with a second peak around spring break in March and April. Hawaii's weather is at its best (not too hot and not too cold, with not so much rain) in April, May, September, and October \u2014 as it happens, this is also the period when some of the best deals can be had.\n\n\n=== Holidays ===\nHawaii observes all the federal holidays, except Columbus Day. It adds Prince Kuhio Day on March 26th, Good Friday (two days before Western Easter), King Kamehameha Day on June 11, Statehood Day on the 3rd Friday in August, and Election Day (in even-numbered years only, always on a Tuesday, from November 2nd to 8th).  Also, some cities and towns that have a large population of federal workers or military personnel might observe Columbus Day anyway.\n\n\n=== Visitor information ===\nGo Hawaii website\n\n\n== Talk ==\nSee also: Hawaiian phrasebook\nHawaiian and English are the official languages of Hawaii, albeit with English being the predominant language. However, if you encounter someone fluent in Hawaiian or learning the language and speak a few words of Hawaiian you'll instantly find yourself much more appreciated than the average tourist. Japanese is common in the tourism industry due to the large number of Japanese tourists who visit, as well as the large Japanese-American community in the state. There are also many communities that speak Mandarin, Cantonese, Tagalog, Ilocano, Vietnamese, Korean and Samoan.\nHawaiian Pidgin English, usually just called Pidgin, is a creole that many locals grew up speaking which incorporates bits of Hawaiian, Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, Portuguese and many other languages, in addition to its own unique idioms.  It has a unique sound and feel. You will most likely hear Pidgin spoken on the street by Islanders in informal situations; it is Hawaii's language of everyday life.\nThere are some subtle differences in English usage in Hawaii. Learning a few words of Hawaiian can be fun and useful. Some signs in Hawaii use Hawaiian words, and most street signs use Hawaiian names. Some useful words include:\n\nHello\nAloha. (ah-LOH-hah)\nGoodbye\nAloha. (ah-LOH-hah)\nlove\naloha (ah-LOH-hah) (So you indirectly refer to \"love\" when you first see someone and when they have to go.)\nThank you.\nMahalo. (mah-HAH-loh) (Although this word is found on fast food trash receptacles around the islands, it does not mean \"trash\".)\nfinished, done\npau (pow)\nhelp/respect\nkokua (koh-KOO-ah)\nwoman\nwahine (vah-HEE-neh)\nman\nk\u0101ne (KAH-neh)\nchild\nkeiki (KAY-kee)\nlocal resident\nkama\u02bbaina (kah-mah-EYE-nah)\ntoward the mountains\nmauka (MOW-kah, MOW rhymes with pow)\ntoward the ocean\nmakai (mah-KIGH)\nappetizer\npupu (\"POO-poo\")\ndelicious\nono (\"oh-no\")\n\n\n=== Shaka ===\n\nThe shaka sign is a hand gesture often used in Hawaii and adopted by surfers. To make a shaka, make a fist with your hand, and extend the thumb and smallest finger. Many people emphasize it by rotating their hand back and forth (along the arm, as if turning a doorknob).\nThere's not an exact meaning to the shaka, but it generally conveys \"aloha spirit\". Drivers frequently sign the shaka to say \"thank you\" to another driver.\n\n\n== Get in ==\n\nForeign travelers entering Hawaii directly from another country are subject to the same entry requirements as for the United States in general. See the Get in section of the United States article.\nAs Hawaii is one of the 50 United States, flights between Hawaii and other states are considered domestic flights. Therefore, you never need to show a passport or other documentation when arriving in Hawaii from the U.S. Mainland. When leaving Hawaii on a domestic flight, you only need to show approved picture ID, which for foreign visitors would typically be a passport.\nHawaii has requirements to control the flow of plants and animals. The islands have unique plant and animal life found nowhere else. They also have diseases and pests not found on the U.S. Mainland, and are free of other diseases and pests that are commonly found elsewhere. Because of this, Hawaii is an agricultural quarantine zone. For travelers, this means three things:\n\nYou are required by the Hawaii State Department of Agriculture to fill out a written agricultural declaration while aboard your flight to Hawaii. One declaration form is required per family; the forms will be collected before landing. Any fresh fruits, vegetables, flowers, and the like must be declared and inspected by Department of Agriculture personnel at your port of arrival; some items may be prohibited from entering Hawaii. Penalties for non-compliance are stiff. To avoid delays and hassles, avoid bringing such items with you. (On the reverse side of this declaration is a Hawaii Tourism Authority questionnaire that asks for information about your stay. You are encouraged but not required to complete this questionnaire.)\nWhen leaving Hawaii for the U.S. Mainland, all baggage (checked and carry-on) must be inspected by U.S. Department of Agriculture inspectors at the airport. With the exception of pineapples and treated papayas (pawpaw), any fresh fruits (grown in Hawaii or elsewhere) are prohibited from leaving Hawaii to control the spread of fruit flies. Consult the U.S. Department of Agriculture for more details. Depending on the airport you leave from and the airline, be prepared to submit to as many as three X-ray checkpoints on the way to your Mainland flight: having your checked bags X-rayed in the ticket lobby, the TSA security checkpoint, and perhaps a separate agricultural inspection for your carry-on bags on the way to your gate. That last checkpoint will probably have a sign that says, \"Yes, you have to do this again....\"\nAs Hawaii is rabies-free, pets such as dogs and cats are subject to complex and strict quarantine requirements. The least restrictive provisions (direct airport release or 5-day maximum quarantine) require at least two rabies vaccinations at least thirty days apart and at least 90 days before arrival, the latest of which must be current; microchip implantation; and a negative rabies blood test within the last three years, but at least 120 days before arrival. Pets failing to meet these requirements will be subject to quarantine for up to 120 days.\nHawaii does not observe Daylight Saving Time, which means that the time difference between Hawaii and most of North America varies by the time of year. Hawaii is two time zones behind the U.S. West Coast, thereby accounting for a three-hour time difference during DST for most states. \nTravelers from Asia, Australia, and New Zealand should keep the International Date Line in mind when doing time conversions and flight reservations.  Hawaii is 19 hours behind Japan, making it five hours ahead of Japan by the clock, but a day behind on the calendar. Most flights to Hawaii that leave Asia in the evening will arrive in the morning of the same day, and return flights that leave Hawaii in the morning will arrive in the early afternoon of the next day.\n\n\n=== By plane ===\n\nSee also: Flying in the United States\nMost flights from the mainland U.S. and almost all international flights land in Honolulu on the island of Oahu. From here, passengers destined for a neighbor island will connect to an interisland flight (see By Plane in Get Around below). Nonstop service from the mainland is also available to Kahului on Maui, Kona and Hilo on the Big Island, and Lihue on Kauai.  Kona also serves a limited number of non-stop flights from Japan, and seasonal service from Canada.\nDepending on the airline, nonstop flights to Honolulu leave from most major gateway airports on the West Coast (as well as some smaller ones), as well as many major airports in the Midwest and East Coast. The flight from Los Angeles or San Francisco takes about 5 hours, which is comparable to a flight between the West and East Coasts of the contiguous United States. Thus, a flight from New York will take about 10\u00bd hours.\nJetstar is a budget Australian airline that connects Honolulu to several cities in Australia. From Southeast Asia, there are also low-cost airlines from Kuala Lumpur, Singapore and Manila with AirAsia X.\n\n\n=== By boat ===\nThere are a few trans-Pacific cruises to Hawaii that leave from ports on the West Coast. On an 18-day, 5,000 miles (8,000 km) round-trip cruise between Hawaii and the West Coast, about 12 of those days will be at sea, with nothing on the horizon and nothing to do except what is on the ship. Even if you are an avid cruiser, you may get more Hawaii bang from your cruise buck by flying to Honolulu and taking a seven-day interisland cruise that starts and leaves from there. Pacific Ocean cruises to and from California depart for the most part from mid-fall to mid-spring. (See Get around: By boat for more info on the regular cruises from the Mainland.)\nThere are a few freighter services, but if you are an American citizen embarking in the USA and wishing to travel to Hawaii then you cannot travel this way on a foreign-flagged ship due to the U.S. Passenger Vessel Services Act of 1886. Instead, try cruises from Ensenada, Baja California or Vancouver, British Columbia.\nIt is also worthwhile to troll marinas on the West Coast of the contiguous United States, leaving your contact info and posting to online discussion boards for people planning to spend around a month sailing from the mainland. Ensure that any expectation of compensation including work duties, food, supplies, and damaged equipment is covered in writing so everything is clear.  Storms and days stuck becalmed are to be expected.\n\n\n== Get around ==\n\n\n=== By plane ===\nAir travel is, by and large, compulsory for traveling within the state. Travelers can choose from either a scheduled or unscheduled air carrier.\nThree scheduled inter-island air carriers, Hawaiian Airlines, Mokulele Airlines, and Southwest Airlines, provide set scheduled flights between the islands. You can save money and time by planning \"triangle routes\" that arrive in Hawaii on one island and leave on another, avoiding the cost of a return inter-island flight.\nScheduled flight times run anywhere from 20 minutes to one hour, and can usually be purchased a day or two before departure, although this may increase the cost of traveling.\nVisitors wanting to fly according to their own demand (as opposed to scheduled times) should consider flying on an unscheduled air carrier also known as air taxi service. Contact the air carrier directly and arrange a time and place for pick up. Iolani Air and Big Island Air are two such air carriers.\nThe Hawaiian islands are populated with airstrips that scheduled carriers do not service. In these instances air taxi companies may be the only means of traveling.\nHunters and campers with cumbersome gear planning trips to remote island regions, as well as visitors wishing to \"island hop\", should consider air taxi service.\n\n\n=== By boat ===\nIn general, ferry services between the islands are few and far between, and many are not a practical means of transportation. \nCharter boats sail and motor between some islands, especially the Maui-Molokai-Lanai area. Crossing the channels between islands can be extremely rough going. A few charter companies specialize in having boats delivered interisland and can meet you at your destination. A company offering ferries is Expeditions (Maui\u2013Lana'i $30 one way for adults and $20 for children).\nNorwegian Cruise Lines operates a cruise ship, Pride of America, between the islands, embarking and disembarking in Honolulu. \nInquire at nearby marinas about joining the crew of a local sailboat or yacht out for a cruise.\n\n\n=== By bus ===\nOn Oahu there is an excellent public transportation system on TheBus for bus travel between Honolulu, Waikiki, Kaneohe, and the surrounding suburban and rural areas of Oahu. You can buy a booklet called \"TheBus\" at a local ABC Store giving route information on how to get around the island or online on TheBus.org or download \"DaBus2\" app on a mobile device. Public transportation is limited on the neighboring islands, so renting a car makes sense. There are some bus services available within and between populated areas on the other islands.  They are:\n\nHele-On (Hilo, Kona, Waimea and around the big island of Hawai'i)\nKaua'i Bus (Kauai)\nMaui Bus (Kahului, Wailuku, Lahaina, and other places in western Maui. No service to the Haleakala NP in the eastern part of the island).\nNo regular bus services on Molokai or Lanai.\nInformation on transit can be found here.\n\n\n=== By car ===\nSee also: Driving in the United States\n\nIf you want to take your car to Hawaii, it will either need to be amphibious or freighted by ship with very high cost, making this infeasible unless you plan a long-term stay in Hawaii. However, Hawaii is the only state that honors all other U.S. state vehicle licenses until they expire, provided you apply for a permit within 10 days of the car's arrival. (Incidentally, Hawaii is also the only state that does not require intended residents to exchange their out-of-state driver's licenses.)\nCar rentals should be booked as soon as possible since, as elsewhere in the US, the price charged is based on a supply/demand basis. The exception is Waikiki where you will not need a car on a permanent basis so just rent a car the day before you want one. Some hotels may charge you for car parking; check with your hotel for parking fees before you book your car.\nGasoline, while nowhere near the prices charged in Europe, is more expensive in Hawaii than in many areas of the Mainland. There was a time when gas prices in Hawaii were much more expensive than other states. Nowadays, however, average prices are comparable to San Francisco and Los Angeles, and are sometimes below those cities. Expect to pay about 20-25% more than the average price on the Mainland for gasoline in Honolulu. Neighbor Island prices can be as much as 10-15% above that.\nThe major highways are referred to by number (H-1, H-2, and H-3; they're never called \"I-H-1\" etc.), but most locals refer to other roads not by number but by name, and will likely not understand if you ask for a road by number. For example, you would never hear someone refer to Kalanianaole Highway as \"route 72\" or \"highway 72.\"\nIf you ask for directions, they will likely not be given in terms of compass direction. Instead you will probably receive relative directions based on landmarks. Common landmarks include mauka (toward the mountains), makai (toward the ocean), and on Oahu, \u02bbEwa (toward Ewa Beach, roughly west) and Diamond Head (toward Diamond Head, roughly east). So a query for a grocery store might be met with \"go two blocks makai, turn right on King and it's half a mile up on the mauka side of the street.\"\n\n\n=== By moped, scooter or motorcycle ===\nScooters are also an excellent alternative to getting around the islands. Rental rates are fairly cheap: about $50/day, or $135 for three days, which you can sometimes haggle down. The scooters are also fun to ride and are cheap on gas (typical mileage is 60\u2013100 mpg, or 2.3\u20133.9 L/100 km). You can ride them anywhere except on limited-access highways (of which there aren't many in Hawaii, and there's always a surface street that's probably more scenic).\nScooters only require a valid license for driving a car, not a motorcycle license. The driver must be over 15 (legally out-of-state license aren't acceptable unless the driver is 18, but this is rarely enforced). It's illegal for two or more persons to ride a moped, although this may not be enforced in more remote areas such as Big Island. Helmets are not mandatory, but if you want one (which is always a good idea) you should be able to rent one with your scooter, possibly for free. When you get your scooter, inspect it first, as some are in bad repair: make sure the headlights and turn signals are working, and insist on taking it for a quick spin around the block to check that the acceleration, transmission, brakes, and steering are okay. If anything is amiss, insist on a replacement scooter, or walk away from the deal and find another rental company.\nScooters that can go over 30 mph or have an engine larger than 49 cc are classified the same as motorcycles, so you need a motorcycle license. Motorcycle rentals are easy to find. On most islands, you can also rent out Harley-Davidson motorcycles.\n\n\n=== By bicycle ===\nDepending on where you travel a bicycle can be a great form of transportation if you keep a few things in mind.  Some roads are very narrow and winding which may create a hazard when sharing the road with cars.  There are also some steep hills as Hawaii is a series of mountains erupting from the sea; without a topo map an apparent shortcut may require a challenging hill while a long loop may be flat and avoid large terrain getting you there quicker. If you stay near the beach there is the salty sea air and rain which will eventually rust a bicycle which is kept outside, keep on top of chain and part maintenance and cleaning to prevent damage.  Honolulu has a bicycle registration law requiring a tag for $15, and bicycles without registration can be impounded by police. The law and common sense require a white front and red rear light when operating a bicycle during twilight and night. Many airlines charge an oversized luggage fee for most full size bikes even when boxed; some tour-capable folding bikes can be fit inside a standard suitcase, but most public transportation does not allow bicycles at all.\n\n\n== See ==\n\n\n== Do ==\nThe Hawaiian islands offer a vast number of activities.  Hiking and eco tours are popular on most islands, with opportunities for horseback riding, ATV, air tours, and other methods of exploring the landscape.  Museums and historical sites such as Pearl Harbor are also to be found throughout the islands. Cultural activities such as the Polynesian Cultural Center on Oahu also make for interesting day-long activities.\nOahu is famous for Pearl Harbor tours, but also popular are shark dives in cages, Waikiki snorkel tours as well as around Oahu Tours where you will see all the major highlights of Oahu including Diamond Head, the North Shore and Dole Plantation where you can sample menu items made from fresh picked pineapples.\nMaui is the location for humpback whale watching from December 15 to April 15 each year as the massive humpbacks migrate to Hawaii's warm waters to bear their calves. Also famous from Maui is the Molokini Crater which is a partially submerged volcano crater that you can snorkel at.\nKauai is untamed and beautiful. It has been featured in many major motion pictures over the past two decades (Hook, Jurassic Park, Tropic Thunder, The Descendants, Avatar, and many more). See this island by land or by air to take in the true beauty of this island. Oh and just be ready to see the roaming Roosters that inhabit the island.\nYou can take a land tour or fly over the incredible huge volcano on a helicopter tour of the Big Island. Doors-off flights allow you to feel the heat from the volcano, an amazingly unique experience. Also on the Big Island you have the rare opportunity to swim with wild dolphins, not captive ones.\nHawaii is best known for its beaches and water activities.  Surfing is practically a religion in Hawaii, and scuba diving and snorkeling opportunities exist nearly everywhere.  In addition, jet skiing, parasailing and kayaking are available in tourist areas.\nSince many of the islands' tours and excursions are interacting with nature in some way, it's important to look into each and make sure they are respecting the islands. There are many endangered animals and plants, and because of this there are many laws protecting them. An example would be tour boats that have been fined for chasing dolphins or whales in order to please the tourists, which is illegal and highly disrespectful. Govern yourself the same way while you visit and remember to \"kokua na `aina,\" or respect the land.\n\n\n== Buy ==\nAs in the rest of the United States, U.S. dollars are the local currency. There are plenty of banks, ATMs, and money change offices in all cities. However, none of the major American and foreign banks have branches in Hawaii, so the banking sector is served exclusively by local banks, the largest of which are Bank of Hawaii, First Hawaiian Bank, and American Savings Bank. ATMs are scarcer on the North Shore of Oahu and other rural areas. Because Hawaii is an island state and transporting goods to Hawaii is more difficult, the prices for most goods are more expensive.\nHawaii has a 4.166% general sales tax. The City and County of Honolulu adds an additional tax, making the sales tax rate on Oahu 4.712%.\n\n\n=== Clothing ===\nOther than the stereotypical grass skirt (which is not generally worn in Hawaii except by hula dancers), no pieces of clothing are more associated with the Islands than the aloha shirt and the mu\u02bbumu\u02bbu.\nThe ever-present aloha shirt comes in a wide variety of designs. On one end, there are the brightly colored, tourist-oriented, polyester aloha shirts that many tourist-oriented stores throughout the Islands carry. On the other end of the spectrum are reverse print aloha shirts, which have become standard business attire among businessmen in Hawaii, in the same way that the business suit is on the mainland. These aloha shirts are usually cotton-polyester blend with the design printed on the inside of the shirt, resulting in muted colors that are considered businesslike in Hawaii. This kind of aloha shirt can be found in department stores.\nFor women, the mu\u02bbumu\u02bbu (English: \"muumuu\") is a long Hawaiian dress, usually made of cotton, that hangs loosely from the shoulder.\nA special note on shoes: the lightweight sandal commonly referred to on the Mainland as a \"flip-flop\" or \"thong\" is known as a \"slipper\" or \"slippa\" in Hawaii. Using the mainland term will get you a quizzical look from locals.  Call them by their island name and they will instantly know what you are talking about.\n\n\n=== Made in Hawaii ===\nLocally made bath & body products are popular souvenirs. The islands feature some of the most refreshing fragrances, which are featured in Hawaiian shampoos, body lotions, soaps, oils, incense and floating candles.\n\n\n== Eat ==\nContemporary food in Hawaii, like the language and popular culture, is a medley of traditional Hawaiian, Portuguese, American, and Asia-Pacific flavors. Pacific \"fusion\" cuisine was largely invented in Hawaii. Well-known local chefs include Sam Choy, Alan Wong, Russell Siu, Roy Yamaguchi, and George \"Chef Mavro\" Mavrothalassitis. Seafood is, of course, fresh and tasty. Local beef comes from ranches on Maui and coffee is grown on the Big Island and Kauai. Tropical fruits such as pineapple, mango, bananas, guavas, and papaya, as well as fresh sugar cane, can be bought in most corner stores (although you may be surprised to learn that many of those fruits are now imported from distant locales such as the Philippines and Brazil).\nOne of the most common ways that local food is served is in the form of plate lunch, usually meat or fish with two scoops of rice and macaroni salad. It's always a good deal at any lunch wagon, mall, or outside food court. L&L Drive Inn and Zippy's are probably the most widely distributed chain of plate lunch spots in the Hawaiian islands. Branches of L&L are in some locations on the Mainland as well (as L&L Hawaiian Barbecue).\nAnother way of enjoying local food when roaming around the island is to keep an eye out for the converted trucks or vans that are parked in their regular spots in gas station parking lots, some parks and a variety of places on the island. These lunch wagons offer plate lunches, are popular with the locals and provide great meals (on plastic plates) at very reasonable prices. There is no reason to fear them; they are very common and popular. Food carts provide other kinds of cuisine besides the standard plate lunch.\nYou may be surprised to find that even the McDonald's menu is different. Saimin, a Hawaiian noodle soup inspired by Chinese noodle soups, is a permanent menu item, and was the first regional food to be served in a McDonald's. Another favorite is the breakfast platter at Hawaiian McD's, which features Portuguese sausage, Spam, eggs, and steamed rice, sometimes with fresh pineapple. (Contrary to its poor reputation on the mainland, Spam has traditionally been very popular in Hawaii and is even used in various adapted ethnic dishes.) Also, red fruit punch is a non-carbonated fruit-flavored alternative to Coke or Sprite at the soda fountain.\nPerhaps the best setting for tourists to enjoy traditional Hawaiian food is at a luau (l\u016b\u2018au), a traditional Hawaiian feast. Tourists can find luaus at various locations in the Islands, including many of the major resort hotels. At a modern luau, traditional Hawaiian favorites are served as a p\u016bp\u016b (buffet of appetizers and small main dishes, similar in size to Spanish tapas, which gave its name to the American Chinese \"pupu platter\"), along with Hawaiian music, hula, and other Polynesian entertainment. The downside is that prices vary in the expensive range; expect to pay between $50 and $90 per adult and about half that per child.\nDishes that are often found at luaus include:\n\nLomi salmon, salted salmon hand-mixed (lomi-lomi means \"to massage\") with tomatoes, onions, and pepper; like an island salsa\nK\u0101lua pig, pork wrapped in banana leaves and steamed inside an imu (ground boiler); similar to pulled pork\nPipi k\u0101ula, Hawaiian style beef jerky\nPoi, ground and boiled taro root paste\nLaulau, pork and butterfish (black cod) wrapped in ti plant leaves then steamed\nL\u016b\u2018au, taro leaves baked with coconut cream and usually octopus (this dish inspired the modern name of the Hawaiian feast)\nHaupia, a gelatin-like dessert prepared from thickened coconut milk; famous for being a very mild laxative\nOther local dishes include favorites such as the following:\n\nPoke, chopped and seasoned raw fish (like a tartare), eaten by itself or over sushi rice.\n\u02bbAhi, yellowfin tuna, excellent as sashimi (Japanese style sliced raw fish) or as poke.\nMahimahi, dolphin fish, served as a steak, sandwich, or in almost-raw thin strips.\nOno, a type of fish also known as wahoo. Not coincidentally, the name resembles the Hawaiian word for \"delicious,\" \u02bbono.\nShave ice, an island version of snow cones made from finely shaved ice, comes in lots of \u02bbono flavors. Order your shave ice with azuki beans and/or a scoop of ice cream.\nSaimin, Hawaii's version of a Chinese noodle soup.\nMalasada, fried bread rolled in plenty of sugar, a sort of Portuguese donut. Often sold at special events.\nManapua, local name for a popular type of Chinese dim sum otherwise known as char siu bao. Cured sweet pork wrapped in soft white bread.\nSpam musubi, an unorthodox variant of Japanese riceballs (musubi), composed of salted rice formed into a rectangular shape and topped with spam, wrapped in seaweed. Popular enough to be sold in every Hawaiian 7-Eleven.\nChicken/pork adobo, Filipino dish widely offered and appreciated in Hawaii, where the meat is marinated and then cooked in vinegar and soy sauce.\nLoco moco, a local specialty consisting of a hamburger patty on rice, topped with over easy egg and gravy. Excellent with tabasco sauce. Can be eaten for breakfast or lunch.\nChicken katsu, fried chicken cutlet with savory sauce. Usually served with rice and mac salad.\nIf you are roaming the island away from tourist areas, you may find restaurants are scarce. Many of the numerous golf courses have dining rooms open to the public that offer great meals. They seem to welcome the non-golfer. For specific places at which to eat, see the individual island or city articles. Be sure to check the coupon books that are available at display stands for meal specials.\nPopular local snacks are also heavily influenced by the large mix of cultures present in Hawaii, primarily the Chinese and Japanese. Since many of these snacks are unique to Hawaii and cannot be found anywhere else, consider purchasing a few bags from any grocery store to bring on your travels. A large portion of local snacks fall under the category known as \"Crack Seed\" which refers to a variety of pickled, candied, and dehydrated fruit snacks of Chinese origin.\nThe most popular iterations of Crack Seed snacks are:\n\nLi hing mui - Salted dried plums that are especially popular with the younger locals. Li Hing Mui is known for its unique sweet, salty, and sour flavor. It is commercially sold either with the plum seed intact or seedless and also in a powdered form that can be sprinkled onto arare, fruits, gummy bears, and many other snacks.\nPickled or dried fruits - Mangoes are usually dehydrated for a sweet snack or kept wet and flavored with Li Hing Mui powder. Lemon and orange peels are also salted and dried for a salty/sour snack.\nOther popular local snacks include:\n\nArare - Japanese rice crackers flavored with soy sauce that come in many different shapes and sizes. Arare is commonly paired with dried seaweed, li hing mui powder, or popcorn. Also commonly referred to as \"Kaki Mochi\" or \"Mochi Crunch\".\nDried Seafood - Dried cuttlefish and octopus strips, known by their Japanese names \"Ika\" and \"Tako\", are very popular snacks. Tuna, or \"Ahi\", is also dried and made into Ahi Jerky.\nMacadamia nuts - Originally brought over from Australia, where they are a part of Aboriginal cuisine, but first grown commercially in Hawaii. Dry roasted macadamia nuts are commercially sold plain, with flavoring, or in chocolate. Macadamia nuts in snack form are more popular with tourists than with locals and are usually given as gifts.\nIf you would rather catch your own, fishing in the ocean or gathering in tidepools is free and requires no permit. Fresh-water fishing, however, does require a license.\n\n\n== Drink ==\nBeer: there are a number of excellent local brewpubs in Hawaii. Mehana, Sam Choy's, Honu, Waimea Brewing Company, Liz's Pub, Keoki's and Kona Brewing Company all brew beer in Hawaii or brew it on the mainland and ship it to the islands. The largest of the group is Kona Brewing, which has won several national awards and runs two brew pub restaurants in the islands (one in Kailua Kona, the other in Hawaii Kai on Oahu).\nCocktails: The mai tai is said to have been invented in California, but it's long since been adopted by Hawaii and is well worth trying there.\n\n\n== Sleep ==\n\n\n== Learn ==\nTourists who want to get a taste of Hawaiian culture can sign up for classes in hula, surfing and lei-making at most tourist destinations.\nThere are also a number of cultural and historical centers on Oahu well worth your time, such as the Bishop Museum and Iolani Palace.\nIf you have the money, the time and the inclination, the Polynesian Cultural Center provides a window into Polynesian culture. As its name implies, the Polynesian Cultural Center covers not just Hawaii but also the cultures of Tahiti, Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, Easter Island and the Maori people of New Zealand.\nThe outer islands also have destinations such as Maui Center for Culture and the Arts and the Big Island has the Hilo Art Museum. the Lyman House Museum and the Pacific Tsunami Museum as well as the University of Hawaii's \u02bbImiloa Astronomy Center and Kula Kai Caverns.\nFor those on a budget, there are many activities you can do on any island that are free. All state parks are free to visit and even some National Parks. When the National Parks are not free, most find them very affordable. Hiking, beaches, snorkeling and other like activities are always free when on public land and there are no private beaches. On the Big Island there are many free ranger programs at Kaloko-Honokohau National Historical park and other locations. At the Visitor Information Station on Mauna Kea, you can stay any night of the year between 6PM and 10PM and enjoy a free astronomy tour including large and small telescopes for you to look through. Some hiking and other activities are in National Parks, like Volcanoes so they are at cost, of course.\n\n\n== Work ==\nThe unemployment rate in Hawaii is generally below the average unemployment rate for the country as a whole in Mar 2019, 2.8% vs 3.8%). Hawaii is not an easy place to legally find casual work for non-US work permit holders. To apply for a local government job, by law you must be a Hawaii resident. This is changing though, and police officer applicants do not have to be residents.\n\n\n== Stay safe ==\nTheft is a big problem in cities as well as beaches and parks. If you are camping on a beach, keep bags locked in a car (but don't assume that they are safe in the trunk, especially if you are driving a rental) and keep valuables in a hidden money belt. Although Hawaii is generally considered relatively safe, it does have some violent crime. Consequently, women should not walk alone in unlit areas. Although Honolulu has one of the lowest violent crime rates of metro areas in the U.S., use your common sense.  Stay smart and act as if you were in your own home city: lock doors, lock cars, and don't leave valuables lying around.  Some campgrounds now require a permit (this has the effect of moving homeless people away from tourist areas). Be sure to apply for a reserved area and have your permit even in free camping areas especially around Honolulu.\nAny of the beaches are vulnerable to pickpockets and thieves who break into cars. If you are using a rental car, it is advised you buy a bumper sticker or two to make it seem like you are a local. Paradoxically, keeping the car windows open will prevent break-ins and car damage, as the locals will think there is nothing of worth in the car. As a rule of thumb, do not bring anything to the beach you do not plan on using. If you must bring money, bring a friend to keep it safe.\nIf you are planning a hike in the mountains, monitor local weather reports carefully and use extreme caution in case of rain. Rain is more likely in the mountains, and flash flooding can occur near stream beds with little or no warning. Unsuspecting hikers can drown and be swept downstream.\n\n\n=== Civil defense sirens ===\n\nAlthough it is rather rare, the threat of a natural disaster can occur at any time in Hawaii, sometimes with little or no warning. Besides the occasional destructive lava flow on the Big Island and occasionally destructive hurricanes (see Weather in Understand above), Hawaii can also experience tsunamis and earthquakes.\nIn 1960 the Great Chilean Earthquake (magnitude 9.5) generated a destructive tsunami that devastated Hilo on the Big Island, killing 61 people. In 1992, Hurricane Iniki made a direct hit on Kauai, killing six and causing $1.8 billion in damage. In 2006, most of the state was affected by a magnitude 6.7 quake off Kailua-Kona. No casualties were reported, but it caused extensive property damage and power outages of up to 14 hours on Oahu.\nReintroduced to the mix of potential disasters is the possibility of an enemy attack by nuclear missile, especially with events in 2017 involving North Korean missile tests.\nHawaii has a highly developed civil defense system. High-pitched civil defense sirens are tested statewide at 11:45AM on the first working day of each month. Two tones are tested: a steady alert siren used in the event of imminent natural disaster such as a tsunami, and a wailing tone that oscillates in pitch from high to low, to be used in the event of confirmed, imminent enemy attack.\nIf you hear the steady tone siren go off at any other time, turn on the nearest radio or television set for emergency information.  In the unlikely event you hear the wailing tone go off at any time other than the first of the month, seek shelter immediately and stay there, and stay tuned to radio or TV for further instructions.\n\n\n=== Natural disasters ===\nIf a hurricane or tropical storm is expected, you will usually have at least several days' notice, and local media will pass on advisories, watches, and warnings from the National Weather Service. Your hotel will likely have emergency plans; check with them for advice and stay indoors during the high winds and rain that accompany a tropical cyclone.\nIf a tsunami is expected, you will only have several hours' notice. Either evacuate coastal areas subject to inundation (this includes most of Waikiki), or failing that, find the nearest concrete high-rise hotel and go to the third story or above. Follow the instructions of police and first responders at all times. If ordered to evacuate an area, do so quickly.\n\n\n== Stay healthy ==\nHospitals in Hawaii meet U.S. standards for care, and can be found in the urban areas of each island. The hospitals in Honolulu are larger and have the most advanced equipment; the hospitals on the neighbor islands provide general care. There is a shortage of specialists on the Neighbor Islands. Depending on where you are and how serious your condition is, you may have to be medically evacuated to Honolulu for treatment. All tourists, including U.S. citizens, should have travel insurance with medi-evac coverage, which can get you back home, if needed.\nThe main tourist areas of each island have walk-in urgent care clinics where you can receive non-emergency treatment for whatever ails you.  Some clinics even make hotel room calls. Check with the local phone book or your hotel.  In Waikiki, try Doctors on Call (+1 808-971-6000).  The clinic is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\nPharmacies can also be found in most major shopping areas. Mainland customers of CVS who need assistance with prescriptions should look for the nearest branch of Longs Drugs (the former pharmacy chain had such high brand recognition in Hawaii that CVS chose to retain the brand on its Hawaii locations). Walgreens has opened numerous locations.\nIf you go hiking in the backcountry or go swimming in freshwater pools in Hawaii, you risk catching leptospirosis.  Leptospirosis generally causes flu-like symptoms; in rare cases it can be fatal; the incubation period can be from 2-30 days after exposure. Do not swim in freshwater pools if you have open sores; see a doctor if you develop flu-like symptoms after hiking or swimming. If you do not have open sores and swim in these areas, the best way to avoid Leptospirosis or any bacteria is to never drink any natural water, no matter how clean it looks. If you are backpacking and this is a must, remember to bring the needed water filters and/or iodine pills to treat your water.\nBe sure to have travel health insurance.  If you are a U.S. resident with private health insurance, you should consult your insurance carrier to determine what co-payments apply and to what extent your insurance is accepted in Hawaii by doctors and hospitals in the event you need health care while on your trip. However, if you get a job in Hawaii - even a part-time job - you will receive health insurance by state law (presuming that you are a U.S. citizen or have a green card and are therefore legally eligible to work). See Stay healthy in United States of America for more information.\nIf you have respiratory problems, be aware of volcanic smog (also known as vog). Vog is formed when sulfur dioxide gas from Kilauea mixes with sunlight, water, and dust particles to form a haze made up primarily of sulfur compounds. Normally the northeasterly trade winds blow vog away from the rest of the islands. Southeasterly winds (also known as Kona winds in Hawaii), however, can blow vog toward the other islands. Vog can be a nearly constant presence on the Big Island. While many people in Hawaii can experience symptoms related to vog, it can especially affect those with asthma or other chronic respiratory illness. If you have a respiratory condition and plan to visit the Big Island, consult your doctor for advice.\nWhen going to the beach or swimming, always wear sunscreen lotion or sun guard to protect your skin from burns, as well as hats, covers and sunglasses. The islands are far closer to the equator than most tourists understand, so even if the weather is cooler, the sun's power is still more intense.\n\n\n== Cope ==\n\n\n=== Dress ===\nHawaii's laid-back reputation extends to dress: with ideal weather year-round in most places, shorts are always appropriate around the islands. Long pants are fine, too, and you will still be quite comfortable. You do normally need to wear a shirt in public; going bare-chested is for the beach, although businesses near the beach are tolerant of it, particularly outside of the city. Sandals and flip-flops are always fine for casual wear, but they're always called slippers or slippa by locals. Going barefoot off the beach is not common in the cities, but again, businesses tolerate it to some extent.\nHawaii has many of the Earth's climates on each small island. Research the locations you plan to visit and dress accordingly, as some areas like Volcanoes National Park or Mauna Kea on the Big Island, or Haleakala National Park on Maui will leave you miserable in shorts and tank tops, as they may have below freezing weather, drenching rain and even snow.\nFor the beach or pool, boardshorts or swimming trunks for men are the most popular, though with so many visitors from Asia, speedos are welcome too. Female toplessness is legal in Hawaii, if uncommon. Swimming nude is illegal, although there are a few isolated beaches on each island where people risk it. Unless you're spending the day trekking from beach to beach, save beachwear for the beach and wear regular clothes.\nBusinessmen in Hawaii forgo suits and wear slacks with muted aloha shirts. As a visitor, you would be overdressed in a suit; a dress shirt (with or without a tie) and slacks would be fine. If you do wear an aloha shirt for business, pair it with khaki pants or slacks, socks, and dress shoes or loafers, and button all but the top button while at the office. Normally aloha shirts are worn untucked and without an undershirt, but those aspects are up to you.\nThe business aloha shirt extends also to dressing up for fine dining, entertainment, and even church; some preachers wear business aloha shirts for church services. As a visitor, just put on a collared shirt, shoes (such as casual loafers), and, depending on the restaurant you're going to, either shorts or slacks. Ties and jackets will never be necessary.\n\n\n== Respect ==\nIn general, American standards of etiquette (see Respect in United States of America) apply in Hawaii. Hawaii does however have certain cultural differences, owing to the Native Hawaiians and the large population of Asians and people of Asian descent.\n\nAs is the custom in many Asian countries, always remove your footwear when entering the home of an island resident, if so invited.  Shoes and sandals are generally left on the front porch or just inside the front door.\nHawaiian culture should be respected and travellers should be sensitive to the state's rich cultural heritage and diversity \u2014 and the fact that the tourist experience of Hawaiian culture may only scratch the surface. For instance, there are many heiau (temples) in the Islands, where the ancient Hawaiian religion was practiced. Some of these have become tourist attractions in their own right, but visitors should nevertheless treat these places with the same level of respect one would show at a place of worship. To show respect, do not horseplay, rearrange or move any item, and never, ever take any item, including rocks and sand, with you.\nIf you visit Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, you will no doubt hear about Pele, the Hawaiian goddess of volcanoes. An urban legend has it that people who have taken volcanic rock from Hawai'i, not just the park, have suffered various misfortunes; it is believed that it is the wrath of Pele. In any case, it is illegal to take rocks or other material from a national park. It is also unethical and looked down upon to take any rocks, sand or other natural items from the islands, for religious, moral and environmental reasons alike. Take only pictures, leave only footprints.\nNative Hawaiians do not identify as Native Americans, as they are culturally and historically distinct from people indigenous to the continental United States. Just stick to the term \"Native Hawaiian\".\nThe status of Native Hawaiians vis-a-vis the U.S. federal government has become a hot topic, with some Native Hawaiian groups seeking a degree of sovereignty for the Hawaiian people as redress for the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy and U.S. annexation in the 1890s. (Honolulu is home to the only royal palace on U.S. soil.) There is no consensus among Native Hawaiians on what form this sovereignty should take, with some preferring the status quo of ordinary citizenship, some seeking a status similar to that of Native Americans, and some wanting complete independence and secession from the Union. In addition, private and government programs that benefit Native Hawaiians have been called into question via a series of lawsuits that have received extensive coverage in local media.  Discussions of Hawaiian sovereignty and programs can arouse a variety of strong opinions (both in support and in opposition) among Hawaii residents of all ethnicities, and the uninitiated visitor would be wise to avoid bringing up these topics in casual conversation.\nWith that in mind, there are some subtle differences in English word usage. When talking with Hawaii residents, be aware of the following differences in word usage to avoid miscommunications.\n\nAlways refer to the continental United States as \"the Mainland\" rather than \"the States.\" Hawaii has been one of \"the States\" since 1959, and the Hawaiian sovereignty movement notwithstanding (see above), most Hawaii residents are proud to be part of the United States. This is especially true for Japanese-Americans, many of whose relatives served in the celebrated 100th/442nd unit in World War II.  Using the term \"the States\" (implying that Hawaii is somehow foreign) may be seen as naive at best and condescending at worst. However, don't be surprised if some local people are condescending towards you because you are from the mainland. The \"local\" vs. \"mainland\" difference is something local people are only too happy to point out.\nResidents of Hawaii do not necessarily consider themselves \"Hawaiian.\" For instance, when asking a Hawaii resident, \"Are you a native Hawaiian?\" don't be surprised if his reply is \"No, I'm Japanese.\" (Ask instead, \"Were you born and raised in Hawaii?\") On the Mainland, for example, \"Californian\" means any person who lives in (or has ties to) California. However, in Hawaii, the terms \"Hawaiian\" or \"native Hawaiian\" are reserved to mean someone who is descended from the indigenous people of Hawaii. This definition even appears in state laws. Because Hawaii is made of people of various ethnicities, someone whose family may have lived in Hawaii for generations may still not be Hawaiian by the above definition. To avoid misunderstanding, it is best to refer to Hawaii residents as such: \"Islanders\", \"locals\", or \"kama\u02bbaina\", unless you know for a fact that they are of native Hawaiian descent.\nSome Native Hawaiians may attribute accidents caused by nature (such as a landslide at Sacred Falls that killed several people) to the Menehune punishing tourists disrespecting the land. Menehune or not, Hawaii is one of the most beautiful places in the world and its sites deserve our respect. Bottom line: respect the land and the people; there may be more there than meets the eye.\n\n\n== Connect ==\n\n\n=== Post ===\nHawaii uses the U.S. Postal Service with zip codes 96701-96898 and a state code of \"HI\".  Postage in Hawaii uses the same rates as the mainland, and is considered domestic for all postal purposes.  First class and priority mail do not experience delays, but ground shipments can be much slower.  Private companies FedEx and UPS are present in Hawaii, express shipment times are the same, but add 2-3 days for ground shipments.\n\n\n=== Internet ===\nFree Wi-Fi is widely available, and can easily be found in most cafes and shopping centers. All major hotels offer free Wi-Fi for guests, and it is available at most airports. Public computers are available at public libraries for library cardholders; visitors may purchase a 3-month library card for $10.\n\n\n=== Phone ===\nHawaii's area code is 808.  All 10 digits must be dialed when making local calls.  When dialing any off-island telephone number, dial 1 + area code + phone number.  You must include the 808 area code when calling another island.  Long distance charges to the mainland, if any, are usually the same standard domestic rates as it would be if calling within the 48 contiguous states.  Check with your phone/long distance company to be sure.\n\n\n== Go next ==\nAs Hawaii is in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, the state has few nearby neighbors.\n\nCalifornia - The point of departure for many visitors from the continental United States. San Francisco is over 150 miles closer than Los Angeles because it's much further west. A few other California cities also have non-stop flights as well.\nOceania - Hawaii can be a stepping off point to explore the many islands of the Pacific as well as the countries of Australia and New Zealand.\nJapan"

        "title": "Dublin",
        "extract": "Dublin (Irish: Baile \u00c1tha Cliath, \"Town of the Hurdled Ford\") is the capital city of Ireland. Its vibrancy, nightlife and tourist attractions are world renowned and it's the most popular entry point for international visitors to Ireland.\nAs a city, it is disproportionately large for the size of the country with a population of over 2 million in the Greater Dublin Region (2022); nearly half of the Republic's population lives in this metropolitan area. The central sights can be navigated by foot, with a few outlying sights, and suburbs sprawling out for miles.\nThe climate is mild, making Dublin a year-round destination. It's seldom freezing in winter, cool in summer and frequently has light showers. For more information, see County Dublin weather chart.\n\n\n== Understand ==\n\n\n=== History ===\nDublin is in a low-lying, fertile area, not boggy by Irish standards, and with good sea access. It became the core of the Gaelic kingdom of Leinster, and the Vikings established a large settlement by what is now Dublin castle, until ejected by Brian Boru at the Battle of Clontarf in 1014. This set a pattern that Dublin was fought for, not fought in. The Normans colonised the southwest and Leinster from the 12th century, and further out they battled with the Gaels, but Dublin sat snug within the \"Pale\" \u2014 the defensive palisade. Similarly with the Tudor conquests; then the city fell swiftly to Cromwell so his atrocities were elsewhere, and King William marched in unopposed after the Battle of the Boyne. 18th century Dublin was the second largest city in the British Isles, with a tight little Protestant clique ruling the place to London's liking. Industry and culture flourished, and the city acquired its graceful Georgian streets and squares, but Ireland was ruled as a colony. Britain's other colonies watched with great interest as the independence movement gathered pace.\n\"The Troubles\" of the late 19th and early 20th century involved ethnic conflicts, paramilitary gangs, and savage reprisals by the authorities. The outbreak of the First World War seemed to put a brake on this, with tens of thousands of Irishmen marching away to France and Flanders. Surely one big push on the Somme would win this war - but while the generals were planning this, armed insurrection broke out at Easter 1916. The rebels seized the central Post Office on O'Connell Street, read their proclamation of independence, then were bombarded until they surrendered. Initially they attracted little sympathy or support, especially as they were backed by arch-foe Germany, but the authorities snatched defeat from a quick win by the subsequent court-martials and executions by firing squad. Hundreds were arrested and 15 were shot. This and atrocities such as the Croke Park massacre were fatal to the legitimacy of British rule. By 1921, the Irish tricolour fluttered over a Dublin that was capital of a separate state.\n\n\n=== Orientation ===\n\nDublin is divided by the River Liffey. North of the Liffey runs O'Connell Street the main thoroughfare, intersected by numerous shopping streets such as Henry Street and Mary Street. On the south bank are Merrion Square, St Stephen's Green, Grafton Street (the main southside shopping area), Trinity College, Christ Church and St Patrick's Cathedrals, the main branches of the National Museum, and many other attractions.\nThe postal district Dublin 1 is north of the river centred on the Post Office, Dublin 2 is south centred on Trinity College, and so on out to the suburbs. These districts have been incorporated into Eircodes, which cover the whole Republic. Thus D04 followed by four alphanumerics is somewhere around Ballsbridge. These pages state Eircodes wherever possible, as keying them into an online map will drop you onto the exact address. They only apply to addresses that receive mail so a lonely megalithic tomb on a mountainside won't have one, but that's seldom an issue in downtown Dublin.\nVisitor info: Several places purport to be tourist information offices, but are simply agencies selling tours. The official source of advice is Visit Dublin, with two walk-in centres:\n\nNorthside at 14 O'Connell St Upper D01 WP59, 200 yards north of the post office, M-Sa 9AM-5PM;\nSouthside at 3 Palace St D02 T277, next to City Hall west end of Temple Bar, M-Sa 9AM-5PM, Su 10:30AM-3PM.\n\n\n== Get in ==\n\n\n=== By plane ===\nMain article: Dublin Airport\n1 Dublin Airport (DUB IATA) (10 km north of city centre). Dublin Airport has an extensive short and medium haul network, and is the base for Aer Lingus, Aer Lingus Regional, and Ryanair. Terminal 2 handles wide-bodied jets and is used by Aer Lingus (& Regional), American Airlines, Delta, Emirates, Norwegian and United. All others use the older Terminal 1, some 300 m north with a walkway between. Together they offer direct flights from most major cities in the UK (serving all London airports, but most frequently Heathrow) and Europe (including Keflav\u00edk, Moscow and Istanbul). North American flights arrive from New York, Newark, Boston, Chicago, Orlando, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington (with pre-clearance of US customs & immigration westbound) and Toronto. Middle East flights include Dubai, Doha and Abu Dhabi. Domestic flights are from Kerry and Donegal; there are none from Belfast, Shannon or Cork. All the main car hire companies have kiosks in Arrivals. There's a better choice here than in the city centre, but book ahead for the best deals. The airport has car parking short-term on-site, long-term off-site, and \"meet & greet\" services. The currency kiosks are run by ICE with a 10% buy/sell spread, decent value. Radisson Blu and Maldron hotels are at the airport, with a few more at the M1/M50 junction just south and in Swords to the north.   (updated Jun 2024)\nBetween airport and city: bus and taxi are the options, there's no rail / metro link.\n\n Aircoach. Aircoach 700 runs to the city centre from T1 then T2, every 15-30 min,taking 30 min, fare in 2024 is \u20ac10 single or \u20ac15 return. The last bus to the city is 1:30AM then the next is 6AM. See below for Aircoach 701, 702 and 703 for south side of Dublin. They also run to other cities such as Cork and Belfast. Taxi drivers routinely try to pick up passengers waiting at the Aircoach stop: they're forbidden to do so, but offer a similar rate and get many takers, so they persist. (updated Jul 2024)\nDublin Express runs to city centre and Heuston Station every 10 minutes or so. The last bus to the city is 11PM then the next is 5:30AM. The cost in September 2024 was \u20ac8 single. \u20ac10 return if purchased online.\n\nLocal buses by Dublin Bus are much slower \u2014 allow an hour \u2014 but much cheaper at \u20ac2.60 in coins, or \u20ac2 if paying with a Leap Card (see \"Get around\"), and may be more convenient for the suburbs. The two routes are:\nBus 16 via Drumcondra railway station, O'Connell St, George's St and out to the southern suburbs of Rathmines and Ballanteer / Kingstown. It runs from morning until late evening.\nBus 41 via Drumcondra railway station and O'Connell St, passing near Bus\u00e1ras, to Lower Abbey St. Northbound it runs out to Swords. It runs 24 hours every 20-30 minutes.\nStops for the local buses are at Terminal 1 through the car park opposite Arrivals exit and then to the right. Pay with exact coins (bus drivers don't accept cards or banknotes, and don't give change). Alternatively, purchase a prepaid Leap Card (see \"Get around\") from a convenience store in the terminal or near the bus stops. Luggage space is limited on these local buses, and it's not unknown for drivers to turn away travellers with packs that cannot be stored.\nTaxis to city centre might cost \u20ac34-40 (July 2024), so they are competitive with the Aircoach for a group of three or more. See \"Get around\" for rules on taxis.\nOther destinations: most buses to other Irish cities run via the airport, see individual cities' \"Get in\". Within County Dublin:\n\nBus 101 runs every 20 min to Balrothery, Balbriggan and Drogheda. This bus runs from Dublin Talbot St via Drumcondra but is not available for journeys just between city, airport and Swords.\nBus 102 runs from the airport every 30 min to Swords, Malahide, Portmarnock and Sutton near Howth.\nDrumcondra (Bus 16 & 41) has trains from Connolly towards Maynooth.\nAircoach Bus 700 runs to Leopardstown and Sandyford, 702 to  Bray and Greystones, and 703 to D\u00fan Laoghaire, Dalkey and Killiney.\n\n\n=== By train ===\n\nThe country's railways converge on the city: see Irish Rail for timetables, fares and online tickets, and see also Rail travel in Ireland.\n2 Connolly (St\u00e1isi\u00fan U\u00ed Chonghaile), Amiens St, Dublin 1 (200 m north of bus station). Ticket office 6:30AM-7PM. This serves the north plus the east coast, with trains from Sligo (3 hr), Belfast via Drogheda (2 hr), and Rosslare ferry port via Wexford and Wicklow (3 hr). From Derry change in Belfast. Connolly is also the hub for local DART trains. It has toilets, ATM and small shops, and a bar and restaurant. The surrounding area is tacky at night; the station is closed between midnight and 5AM M-Sa, 7AM Sunday. Many Irish railway stations are named for those executed for their part in the Easter Rising - the British thoughtfully ensured plenty names to go round - and this one is named for labour organiser James Connelly (1868-1916). (updated Jun 2024)\n3 Heuston (St\u00e1isi\u00fan Heuston), St Johns Rd West, Dublin 8 (2 km west of city centre, on LUAS tram red line). Ticket office 7AM-9PM. This serves all directions except the north or the east coast. Trains run from Cork (2\u00bd hr), Galway (2\u00bd hr), Westport (3\u00bd hr), Limerick (2 hr 15 min) and Waterford (2 hr). There are connections from Ballina, from Tralee and Killarney, from Clonmel and Tipperary, and from Nenagh. Heuston has toilets, ATM, small shops, kiosks and cafes, plus supermarkets on the streets nearby. To reach the centre take the tram. The station is named for railway worker Se\u00e1n Heuston (1891-1916). (updated Jun 2024)\nAllow 45 min if you need to transfer between Heuston and Connolly.\n\n\n=== By bus ===\n4 Bus\u00e1ras bus station is just south of Connolly railway station and 300 m east of O'Connell Street. It has Bus Eireann services from most towns in Ireland, such as Belfast (2 hr 30), Cork (4 hr), Limerick (3 hr 30), Galway (4 hr) and Donegal (2 hr 30), all running via the airport. Other operators are Kavanaghs from Limerick and Waterford, and Citylink and GoBus from Galway. Eurolines 871 runs on Saturday evening from London Victoria via Birmingham, Holyhead and the ferry to reach Dublin city centre early Sunday morning; the reverse run leaves Dublin Friday evening. The station has luggage lockers and pay-to-enter toilets in the basement.\nOther bus companies don't use this station but leave from stops in the nearby streets.\n\n\n=== By boat ===\n\n5 Dublin Port has ferries from Holyhead in Wales (Stena and Irish Ferries, 3 hr 30 min), Bootle near Liverpool (P&O, 8 hrs and  Douglas, Isle of Man (Isle of Man Ferries, 3 hr 30 min). From Cherbourg in Normandy and  Pembroke in Wales they nowadays only sail to Rosslare and not to Dublin. \nThe port is 2 km east of the centre; the number 53 bus connects the port to the bus station by Custom House in central Dublin. The bus usually only accepts Leap Cards. or coins: occasionally a driver will accept payment by notes or cards, but this is the exception. There is no facility for buying Leap Cards at the port. Foot passengers opting to walk to or from the port should avoid Alexandra Road. The M50 tunnel (toll) allows motorists to disembark at Dublin and drive straight onto the motorway without getting snarled in city centre traffic.\nThe former ferry port of D\u00fan Laoghaire is no longer used.  Another ferry route is the short crossing from Cairnryan in Scotland to Belfast, then by road or rail to Dublin.\n\n\n=== By car ===\nIf you're visiting just for a day trip, don't bring a car into the congested centre, use a Park & Ride. From the south, use either Sandyford Luas stop, just off junction 15 of M50 on Blackthorn Rd, or Bray DART stop on Bray Rd. From the west, use Red Cow Luas stop, off junction 9 of M50. From the north east, use Howth DART station. Park & Ride spaces cost \u20ac4 all day, though you've the tram or train fare to add on.\n\n\n== Get around ==\n\nYou can see much of the city on foot.\n\n\n=== By public transport ===\nPublic transport in Dublin consists of trains, trams and buses. Unlike many other European capitals, the rail network in Dublin is quite limited, so buses are by far the main mode of public transport. Public transport is not run by a single agency, but by a number of state-contracted operators, and most information is provided separately on each operator's website. Trains are run by Irish Rail and trams by Luas, while most buses are run by Dublin Bus, except some local buses in suburban areas which are run by Go-Ahead Ireland.\nTransport for Ireland (TFI) is the umbrella brand for public transport in Ireland, although its website primarily just directs you to the individual operators websites for information. However, the TFI Journey Planner is a good way to plan your journey across different modes, and the Live Departures provides real time information for all rail and bus stops. TFI also provides a number of smartphone apps including a journey planner and real time departures. Note that the journey planner app also provides real time departures, so you don't need to download both. The TFI Journey Planner and Live Departures are also integrated into Google Transit and are available within Google Maps.\n\n\n==== Tickets and Leap Card ====\nOn trains and trams, tickets can be purchased from ticket vending machines at the station or stop prior to boarding. Train tickets are valid for the day of purchase and are needed to get through the entry and exit turnstiles at stations. Tram tickets do not have to be validated prior to boarding, but must be used within 90 minutes of purchase. On buses, you can pay the fare to the driver when boarding, but you must have the exact amount in coins. Banknotes cannot be taken, and if you overpay in coins, no change is given.\nIf you plan to use public transport a lot, consider getting a TFI Leap Card, which you can top up with credit and use to pay fares on all public transport in the city, at a 30% discount. Leap Cards can be purchased from most convenience shops at just \u20ac5 for adults and \u20ac3 for children (this is actually not a charge but a deposit, and if you register your card online, it can later be refunded to an EU bank account or a number of charities). You can check your credit and top up the card at most convenience shops, at train or tram ticket vending machines, and on your phone with the Leap Top-Up App.\nTo use your Leap Card on trains or trams, you need to tag-on by holding your card against the turnstile or validator before boarding, and then tag-off again at the turnstile or validator at the end of your journey. You will automatically be charged the relevant fare between the tag-on and tag-off locations. To use your Leap Card on buses, you can place the card on the driver's machine, and tell the driver where you are going, and they will deduct the relevant fare. If you know that you are making a longer journey, you can instead hold your card against the other validator on the right hand side of the door, where you will automatically be charged the highest fare. Unlike trains and trams, you don't need to tag-off when you leave the bus. It's important to note that if you don't tag-on before travelling, you don't have a valid ticket, so you could be fined if a ticket inspector boards and checks your card.\nSingle fares are around 30% cheaper with a Leap Card than with cash. A 90-minute fare applies, meaning that after you tag onto any mode of transport, you can use the same Leap Card to tag onto any other Dublin regional buses, trams or trains within the next 90 minutes without extra cost. The fares are also capped, so once you reach a certain amount within the same day or week (Monday to Sunday), you can continue to travel for free for the remainder of that day or week. For adults, the daily caps are \u20ac5.60 for buses or trams, \u20ac7.60 for trains and \u20ac8 for all modes. The weekly caps are \u20ac22 for buses or trams, \u20ac29.60 for trains and \u20ac32 for all modes. Child caps are much lower, about one third of the adult caps.\nA special Leap Visitor Card is also available for tourists, which allows unlimited use of all public transport for 1 day (\u20ac8), 3 days (\u20ac16), or 7 days (\u20ac32), starting from the time of first use. This can be purchased at arrivals in Dublin Airport (WH Smith and Wrights in Terminal 1 and Spar in Terminal 2) in some city centre tourist offices, or ordered online for delivery. Once your chosen time period expires, you can also top it up with additional time periods at most convenience shops in the city.\n\n\n=== By train ===\n\nInter-city, commuter and DART trains use the same track, but vary in the stops they make. For timetables, route maps and fares, see Irish Rail. \n\nDART (Dublin Area Rapid Transit) is a suburban line along the coast, from Howth and Malahide in the north to  Bray and Greystones in the south, via Connolly and other city centre stations, D\u00fan Laoghaire and Dalkey. Trains run 6AM-11PM and the core section between Howth Junction and Bray has trains M-F every 10 min and Sa Su every 30 min. North of Howth Junction, alternate trains head either for Malahide or for Howth. South of Bray, every third train extends to Greystones. Change at Bray for inter-city trains to Wicklow, Wexford and Rosslare.\nCommuter trains fan out to towns within an hour or so of the city.\n- North from Connolly to Drogheda, along the coast via Portmarnock, Malahide, Donabate, Rush, Skerries and Balbriggan. They're hourly, daily, and rush-hour trains extend to Dundalk. Change at Drogheda for Newry and Belfast.\n- West from Connolly to Maynooth via Drumcondra, Castleknock, Clonsilla and Leixlip. There's a branch line from Clonsilla to Dunboyne and M3 Parkway, which is the P&R for the Navan and Trim area. They're hourly, daily; change at Maynooth for Mullingar, Longford, Boyle and Sligo. Another branch line connects Grand Canal Dock with Connolly and Drumcondra.\n- Southwest from Heuston to Portlaoise via Park West & Cherry Orchard, Clondalkin, Adamstown, Hazelhatch & Celbridge, Sallins (for Naas), Newbridge, Kildare, Monasterevin, and Portarlington. They're hourly M-Sa and every two hours on Sunday. The branch line from Grand Canal Dock also connects M-F via Connolly and Drumcondra, bypassing Heuston to join the route at Park West & Cherry Orchard as far as Hazelhatch & Celbridge.\nConnolly and Heuston are the principal stations, see Get in. Others that visitors might use are on the DART line south from Connolly:\n\n- Tara Street just south of the river for Temple Bar and Trinity College\n- Pearse for Merrion Square and the National Museums\n- Grand Canal Dock for southside dockland and the start of the canal\n- Lansdowne Road for the stadium\n- Sandymount for Ballsbridge\nFares: The short hop zone covers all DART and commuter rail services as far as Balbriggan, Kilcock, Sallins and Kilcoole. As of 2021, a standard single is \u20ac2.25-6.20 adult and \u20ac1.25-2.55 child. Paying by TFI Leap Card it's \u20ac1.70-4.90 adult and \u20ac0.80-1.94 child. Day return, 1 day, 3 day, 7 day and monthly tickets are also available. A family all day ticket is \u20ac20, for up to 2 adults and 4 children; it's rail-only and doesn't include tram or bus. (See Rail travel in Ireland for other ticket deals, some of which are thoroughly bad value.) Your ticket is valid for any train so if you were at Bray waiting for the Dart service back to city centre, and the inter-city from Rosslare happened to pull in, you could hop aboard. \n\n\n=== By tram ===\n\nLuas, Irish for \"speed\", is Dublin's tram system. Trams are modern and reliable, and run frequently from 6AM to midnight. There are two lines:\n\nRed line is east-west, from The Point in dockland and Connolly Station to Bus\u00e1ras, Abbey Street, Heuston Station, St James's Hospital, Red Cow P&R then either Tallaght P&R or Cheeverstown P&R and Saggart in the southwest of the city.\nGreen line is north-south, from Broombridge to TU Dublin Grangegorman Campus, Marlborough St southbound / O'Connell St northbound, Trinity College, St Stephen's Green, Dundrum, P&Rs at Balally, Stillorgan and Sandyford, Leopardstown, Carrickmines P&R and Brides Glen in the southeast of the city.\nThe lines cross in north city centre, with a 100-m walk from the Abbey Street stop on the Red line to the Green lines north or south, a block apart at that point. \nYou must buy your ticket before boarding: there are machines by all the stops. Visitors are only likely to use the outer sections for the Park & Rides. For the city centre zone, e.g. between Heuston and Connolly, in 2024 it's \u20ac1.70 adult standard and \u20ac1.30 by Leap Card. Day return, 1 day and 7 day tickets are available.\n\n\n=== By bus ===\n\n\n==== City network ====\nAn extensive network of 150 bus routes serves most parts of the city and its surrounding suburbs. Most buses in the city centre pass through the O'Connell St area (including Mountjoy and Parnell Squares, Eden Quay and Fleet St) and the Trinity College area (including Pearse St, Nassau St, Dame St and College Green). Services vary from high frequency routes running every few minutes all day, to lower frequency routes running every hour or less, to peak-only limited-stop \"Xpresso\" routes and weekend-only late night \"Nitelink\" routes.\nConfusingly, the bus network in Dublin is run by two separate companies, with timetables listed on two separate websites, and displayed at stops in two different formats. However, both companies share the same fare structure and Leap ticketing system, and all routes are included in the Transport for Ireland Journey Planner and Real Time apps:\n\nDublin Bus operate all cross-city routes, and all routes which run to and from the city centre. The timetables displayed at stops refer to the time the bus leaves the terminus, not the time it will be passing that particular stop, so there is a bit of guesswork required.\nGo-Ahead Ireland operate local routes in the suburbs, as well as orbital routes which avoid the city centre. In contrast to Dublin Bus, all Go-Ahead Ireland timetables displayed at stops refer to the times buses are due to be passing that particular stop.\nA detailed map of the entire city network, colour coded by frequency is available here (and for the far outer areas see here).\nCash fares within the city (exact amount in coins only) are \u20ac2.15-3.80 adult and \u20ac1.00-1.60 child, while if paying with a TFI Leap Card are \u20ac1.55-3.00 adult and \u20ac0.80-1.26 child. Those paying with a TFI Leap Card can also benefit from a \u20ac1 discount if interchanging within 90 minutes, and maximum daily and weekly caps. See Tickets and Leap Card.\nAt busier stops, an electronic sign lists the next 4 to 6 real-time departures. For all other stops, real-time departures can be checked online or in TFI apps (see By public transport above). All buses display their route number and destination on the front. When you see your bus approaching, hold out your hand to signal to the driver that you want to get on, otherwise they may not stop. If you have a prepaid TFI Leap Card, enter on the right-hand side and tag on by holding your card against the reader. Otherwise enter on the left-hand side to pay the driver.\nInside the bus, small screens display the next stop in both Irish and English, along with an audio announcement in both languages. When you see or hear your stop being announced, press one of the red buttons to signal to the driver that you want to get off.\n\n\n==== Principal routes ====\n\nCross-city buses are operated by Dublin Bus and ply every 10 minutes M-Sa and 20-30 min on Sundays:\n\nBus 4 from Harristown and Ballymun in the north to Ballsbridge and Blackrock in the southeast.\nBus 15 from Clongriffin and Artane in the northeast to Templeogue and Ballycullen in the southwest. It runs 24 hours, every 30 min overnight.\nBus 16 from Dublin Airport and Santry in the north to Rathfarnham and Ballinteer in the south.\nBus 27 from Clare Hall and Artane in the northeast to Walkinstown and Tallaght in the southwest.\nBus 39a from Ongar and Blanchardstown in the northwest to Baggot Street and University College Dublin in the southeast. It runs 24 hours, every 30 min overnight.\nBus 40 from Charlestown and Finglas in the northwest to Ballyfermot and Liffey Valley in the west.\nBus 41 / 41c operate from Swords, Santry and Drumcondra in the north to Abbey Street in the city centre, with alternate buses (route 41) serving Dublin Airport - this runs 24 hours, every 30 min overnight.\nBus 46a from Phoenix Park northwest to University College Dublin, Stillorgan and D\u00fan Laoghaire southeast.\nBus 130 from Abbey Street in city centre to Clontarf, Bull Island and St Annes Park to the northeast.\nBus 145 from Heuston Station in the inner west to University College Dublin, Stillorgan and Bray in the southeast.\nBus C1 / C2 from Adamstown and Lucan to Heuston station, the Quays, Ballsbridge and Sandymount. Together they run 24 hours, every 30 min overnight.\nBus G1 / G2 from Spencer Dock to St James Hospital Ballyfermot then either Red Cow tram terminal or Liffey Valley Shopping Centre. Together they run 24 hours, every 30 min overnight.\nSeveral orbital routes skirt the city centre, run by Go Ahead, usually daily every 20-30 min: \n\nBus 17 runs south, from Rialto via Terenure, Rathfarnham and University College Dublin to Blackrock.\nBus 17a runs north, from Blanchardstown via Finglas, Ballymun, Santry and Coolock to Kilbarrack.\nBus 18 crosses the inner south, from Palmerstown via Ballyfermot, Kylemore, Crumlin, Rathmines, Ranelagh and Ballsbridge to Sandymount.\nBus 75 crosses the outer south, from Tallaght via Rathfarnham, Ballinteer, Dundrum and Stillorgan to D\u00fan Laoghaire.\nBus 175 takes the same route to Dundrum then heads to University College Dublin.\nBus 76 crosses the west, from Tallaght via Clondalkin, Liffey Valley and Ballyfermot to Chapelizod, with a few extending to Blanchardstown.\nAt night: in summary the 24-hour bus routes are 41 (the only night bus from the airport), 15, 39a, C1 / C2 and G1 / G2. You pay the normal daytime fare for these. \nNitelink buses are extras from midnight Friday and Saturday to 4AM, on 15 routes radiating from D'Olier Street, Westmoreland Street and Aston Quay. They run every hour or two, for instance to Portmarnock, Howth, Balbriggan, Bray and Greystones. You pay a little more for these. Their service is outbound-only then they return to the city empty, so drunks and wastrels can't use them as an overnight doss. As if, in Dublin?\nSee also individual towns for their overnight services from the city.\n\n\n=== By bike ===\n\nHiring a bicycle is a handy way to get around if you want to get outside the very centre of the city and are comfortable cycling in traffic. That being said, the city is not very bicycle-friendly, either in terms of quantity & quality of bike paths, pedestrians and drivers honouring the bike paths, road space available where there is no bike path (i.e. numerous narrow roads), or driver attitudes in general.\nWhen cycling in the city centre, be aware that cycle lanes, where they exist, are generally shared with buses, taxis, motorcycles, and parked cars; cyclists should pay particular attention when approaching bus stops where a bus is pulling out. Motorbikes are not allowed to use the cycle lanes, but many still do so. Passing on the left is also allowed only in limited circumstances but is in fact still common. When cycling in Phoenix Park,  while there is a dedicated cycle lane on both sides of the main thoroughfare unfortunately pedestrians also use these.\nThere are bikes to hire in several locations around the city centre with the Dublinbikes scheme. A 3-day pass (which is the only pass available to non-residents) costs \u20ac5 and gives you access to the bikes. They are free for the first 30min, up to 1h rentals cost \u20ac0.50 and up to 2 hours cost \u20ac1.50, so it is a good idea to return the bikes frequently. You can purchase the 3-day pass only at stations which accept credit cards, but once purchased you can use it to rent bikes at any station. Your credit card will be preauthorized with a security deposit of \u20ac150, which will be charged in case of theft or if the bike was not returned within 24 hours. Among others, there is a Dublinbikes bike hire place located at the entrance to the Phoenix Park, Dublin 8.\n\n\n=== By car ===\nDon't drive if you can realistically avoid it. For instance, if you plan to see Dublin before touring the country, take the bus in from the airport and return there a few days later to hire your car. For a day-trip, use the city edge Park & Rides. If you do venture in, you face traffic congestion (even on Sunday), difficulty parking, confusing one-ways or diversions for road repairs, traffic congestion, drunken revellers and phone-entranced jaywalkers veering into your path, ill-signed but rigidly enforced bus lanes, the silent onrush of trams, and traffic congestion, traffic, traffic....\nOn-street meter parking is in short supply and only for brief periods, and if you over-stay you're likely to be clamped or towed, for a penalty in excess of \u20ac100. For a visit say to a museum you need to seek out a multi-storey car park \u2014 plan ahead for those you might use. Check also what the deal is with your accommodation; a central place may not have its own parking.\nDublin's outer road is M50, which starts from the port downtown and tunnels beneath the north city (toll) to the airport perimeter, where M1 continues north towards Belfast while M50 arcs round the western city with access to all arterial routes. There's another toll between Junctions 6 (N3 Blanchardstown) and 7 (N4 Lucan). Tolls are about \u20ac3, but in rush hour the tunnel is \u20ac10. There are no cash booths, you must pay online either in advance or by 8PM next day, else there's a penalty (to which your hire company and credit card will gleefully add). Hire cars may come with an e-tag.  \nThe Outer Orbital Route, or M45, is a proposed bypass further out, arcing round from Drogheda to Navan, Enfield and Newbridge. The government keeps confirming this plan but nothing has happened; it would carve through important sites such as Hill of Tara. Meanwhile the same name is also used for the Outer and Inner orbital routes within the M50 semicircle. These are just existing streets interconnecting between the radial roads, confusingly signed and with much zigzagging.\n\n\n=== By taxi ===\nTaxis in Ireland can be identified by the yellow plate on the roof. Have nothing to with unofficial taxis.  \nFares are nationally regulated so you pay the same stuck in traffic trying to reach the airport as you do up a back lane in Connemara. Taxis are required to use the meter, to accept credit and debit cards as well as cash, and not to surcharge any card. However it's \u20ac3 extra for booking instead of hailing on the street or using a taxi rank, and phone apps may impose a further charge. Fares are revised every two years so from Dec 2024 you pay:\n\nStandard rate (M-Sa 8AM-8PM): Flagfall (then 500 m or 85 sec) \u20ac4.40; then Tariff A (next 15 km or 43 min) \u20ac1.32 / km or \u20ac0.47 / minutes to max \u20ac23.60; then Tariff B \u20ac1.72 / km or \u20ac0.61 / min.\nPremium rate (M-Sa 8PM-8AM, all day Sunday and most public holidays): Flagfall \u20ac5.40, Tariff A \u20ac1.81 / km or \u20ac0.64 / minutes to max \u20ac31.80; then Tariff B \u20ac2.20 / km or \u20ac0.78 / min.\nSpecial rate (Sa Su midnight-4AM, 24 Dec 8PM through Christmas to 8AM 26 Dec, 31 Dec 8PM to 8AM 1 Jan): same as Premium rate but after flagfall you go straight to Tariff B, there's no Tariff A.\n\n\n== See ==\n\nDublin's top attractions sell out in summer. Buy tickets online in advance if you know you want to see something, especially for the Book of Kells where even early arrivals may find all the day's slots are filled.\nThe Dublin Pass gives you free and fast track entry to thirty-some attractions in Dublin. Adult prices in 2024 are \u20ac79 for one day, \u20ac109 for two, \u20ac129 for three, \u20ac154 for four and \u20ac164 for five, child prices about half, and days must run consecutively. You'll struggle to break even on this deal as only the Hop-on Hop-off bus tour and the Jameson Distillery and Guinness tours charge over \u20ac25; most are way cheaper. The Pass doesn't include the National Museum sites (free anyhow), the Library and Book of Kells at Trinity College, or any public transport.\n\n\n=== North of the river ===\n1 GPO Museum, O'Connell St Lower D01 F5P2, \u260f +353 1 872 1916. M-Sa 10AM-5PM. The GPO is the headquarters of the Post Office in Ireland, built in Neo-Classical style 1814-1818. In 1916 it was occupied by Irish rebels led by PH Pearse, who read the Proclamation of the Republic outside the front door of the building. The interior was burnt out by shelling from government forces against the rebels, but the exterior survived. Subsequently the GPO was restored, reopening in 1929, and remains a busy working post office. The museum within it is a multimedia exploration of the Easter Rising. Adult \u20ac17, conc \u20ac15, child \u20ac8.50.   (updated Jun 2024)\nO'Connell Street is the broad thoroughfare running north from the river, and the main district for budget accommodation. It was smashed up in the 1916 uprising and subsequent civil war, but rebuilt; then in the 1970s the developers made one sorry mess of it. And their assistants: All along O'Connell Street the pieces flew, up went Nelson, and the pillar too... was the ditty commemorating the 1966 IRA bombing of Nelson's Column. Where it stood, next to the GPO, is now the 121-m pin of the Spire of Dublin; close by on North Earl St is the James Joyce Statue. Northbound trams glide up the street: go a block east for the southbound track. The city council are doing their best to further improve the place but it's a work in progress: pleasant enough by day, but tacky by night.\n2 St Mary's Pro-Cathedral, 83 Marlborough Place D01 DX9, \u260f +353 1 874 5441. Daily 9AM-5PM. Dublin's Catholic cathedral, built in 1825. Catholicism was always the majority religion in Ireland, but its practice was forbidden until the 19th century. The official cathedral is Christ Church, so designated by the Pope in 1300, but taken over by the Protestants in the 16th century. When the laws relaxed, St Mary's was built in neo-Classical style as a temporary or \"pro\"-cathedral, until such time as the Pope decrees otherwise or the Protestants hand back Christ Church. Neither event appears imminent.   (updated Jun 2024)\n National Leprechaun Museum, 2 Mary's Abbey D07 X6R6 (Tram to Jervis), \u260f +353 1 873 3899. Su-Th 10AM-6:30PM, F Sa 10AM-8PM. The \"little folk\" appeared in lore around 1300 AD but only flourished from the 19th century Celtic revival, dressed in late Georgian garb in an idealised rural past, mending a shoe. They proliferated into the silliest of 20th century Irish tourism, like greenfly upon the Rose of Tralee, and fell out of fashion. This museum is immersive telling of the stories woven around them, with a daytime and darker night show. Day show adult \u20ac18, conce \u20ac16, child \u20ac11.

Tu-Sa 10AM-5PM, Su 11AM-5PM. Sir Hugh Lane (1875-1915) was one of the first collectors of modern art. He died in the sinking of Lusitania and this public gallery reflects his Will, which involved about as much negotiation, fudge and compromise as the Treaty for Irish independence. The permanent exhibitions are mostly contemporary Irish artists, plus Francis Bacon's studio, relocated from London in 2001. Charlemont House was built in 1763 and in 1929 its gardens were built over to create the gallery, which is wheelchair accessible. Free.

Built in 1853, it's the Priory of the Dominican order, who also worship at St Martin's Chapel on Parnell Square.\n\n4 Ha'penny Bridge is the one on all the picture postcards and film locations, a 43 m cast-iron arch spanning the river between Liffey St Lower and Wellington Quay. Officially called the \"Liffey Bridge\" (Droichead na Life), it was built in 1816 to replace the cross-river ferries, with the right to charge a ha'penny toll for the next century. There were turnstiles at both ends, removed in 1919 after the toll ceased. The bridge was extensively repaired in 2001. Please don't clutter it up with \"love-locks\" - the last big clean-up removed 300 kg of these, and bear in mind that those repairs were by Harland and Wolff, builders of the Titanic.\nDownstream from O'Connell Bridge the river broadens into dockland and the open sea, with poignant reminders of the Irish people's relationship with that sea.\n5 The Famine Memorial on Custom House Quay depicts victims of the Great Famine (an Gorta M\u00f3r) of 1845-49, when a million died and another million fled the country. Five gaunt figures totter to the docks with their bundles as if to take ship and leave. Or perhaps they hope for scraps from those ships, which during the famine years were briskly exporting food for profit, plenty to feed everyone yet unaffordable to most.\n6 EPIC The Irish Emigration Museum, CHQ, Custom House Quay D01 R9Y0 (Tram to George\u2019s Dock), \u260f +353 1 906 0861.

It spans the river between North Wall Quay (in Docklands, north bank) and Sir John Rogerson's Quay (near Grand Canal Square, south bank) and the whole contraption hinges through 90 degrees to let ships pass. Daytime it's busy with traffic and is most scenic when floodlit at night.

Built in the 1740s, its first occupant was Lord Viscount Molesworth and his family, and after him came a series of Right Honorable This and Viscount That and Bishop of Wherever. But the union with England in 1801 drained power and money to London, and the neighbourhood went downhill. Rural folk flocked to Dublin after the famine, so the building was broken up into tenements, with 100 living here. From the 1930s the inner city drained out to new suburbs, and No 14 fell derelict in 1970 before being preserved. Visit by guided tour. Adult \u20ac10, conc \u20ac8, child \u20ac6.

Kells: May-Sep M-Sa 8:30AM-7PM, Su 9:30AM-5PM; Oct-Apr M-Sa 9:30AM-5PM, Su noon-4:30PM. Trinity College is the fine Georgian campus of the University of Dublin. It's generally open to stroll around in daylight hours, but it is a working university, and most interiors are off-limits to tourists. You can visit the Chapel near the front (west) gate of the College. But the big attraction is the Old Library and Book of Kells. Book online, otherwise buy your ticket from the machines under the Lecky library just south. This is for a timed slot, and at weekends may be booked out. You enter an exhibition hall setting the Book in the context of other monastic writings of its period, circa 800 AD. Next enter the display area: only two pages are displayed at any time, one being richly illustrated with little text (or no text, on the \"carpet\" pages), and one page being text of the Vulgate Gospels, written in Insular Majuscule Latin. But it's difficult to enjoy, with crowds jostling round the display case. Next, go upstairs into the massive Long Hall of the library, with books and ladders and more books and ladders towering away upwards. Last but not least, exit through the gift shop, which can be entered without a ticket. Adults \u20ac25, conc \u20ac20, child \u20ac15.

She's entirely fictional, though Dublin had many such street-hawkers, and she's not to be confused with Mary Mallon of Cookstown, the all-too-real \"Typhoid Mary\". Her kitsch statue dates to 1988 and was installed on nearby Grafton Street, but moved to its present spot in 2014 to make way for tram tracks. She's often mocked as \"The Tart with the Cart\" or \"The Trollop with the Scallop\" and her breasts (above an unhistorical low-cut dress) have been well polished by passing hands. Alas amidst these misogynist tropes and gropes, we forget the sad fate of the cockles and mussels themselves.\n13 National Gallery of Ireland, Merrion Square West D02 K303 (another entrance on Clare St), \u260f +353 1 661 5133.

Amazing display of Ireland's artefacts from prehistory through the Viking era to independence. The standout is the Treasury (with the 12th century Ardagh Chalice and 9th century Tara Brooch), and the prehistoric jewellery: gold and silver beautifully worked and carved - then chucked into the bog?? And likewise into the bog went bodies, presumably of defeated foes and heinous criminals given the violence of their deaths. Normally when a body is buried, the flesh decays and a skeleton persists. But if you throw a body into a peat bog, the acid dissolves the bones while tannin preserves the hide. The person turns into a handbag. Free.   (updated Jun 2024)\n Leinster House, Kildare Street D02 TK75, \u260f +353 1 618 3000. This opulent Georgian mansion is in the same block as the Archaeology Museum. Designed by Cassels, it was built in 1745 as the residence of the Duke of Leinster at a time when the southside was unfashionable. It proved an \"anchor development\" and Dublin's centre of power and culture soon gravitated from the northside. From 1922 it became the temporary base of the Oireachtas, the Irish bi-cameral parliament, and like the Ulster border it remains temporary over a century later.

At the northwest corner is a life-sized statue of the writer and dramatist Oscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wills Wilde (1854-1900), who grew up at No. 1 here. He's depicted sprawled on the embankment, with a lop-sided smirk, as if totally wasted. (As if! And him with the hollowest legs in London!) Two short marble columns are covered in his quotable quotes. On the surrounding buildings, plaques commemorate other notable residents, such as the Duke of Wellington. The fine architecture continues south, along Mount Street Upper and Fitzwilliam Street Lower.\n17 St Stephens Green  is a pleasant Victorian public park, open in daylight hours.

Both were built in the 18th and 19th century to carry passengers and freight between Dublin and the Shannon and Atlantic. The Grand Canal took 47 years to construct: the expense of crossing the Bog of Allen replicated the prehistoric custom of sinking gold into bogs. And indeed Irish waterways go that far back, as the earliest dwellers could barely get about by land. Waterways Ireland website gives information eg on walks, navigability and fishing on this and the other canals.\n\n\n=== West city ===\nThe original Dublin was in this area, at the confluence of the Poddle (now culverted) and the Liffey.

Sir Alfred Chester Beatty (1875-1968) was an American mining magnate who amassed a fabulous collection of early books and manuscripts and oriental art. He moved to London and collaborated generously with the British Museum, but in 1950 there was a falling-out and he moved to Ireland.

So this is the oldest building in Dublin, though it underwent a massive restoration in the 1870s. It became Protestant under Henty VIII, apart from a brief Roman Catholic interlude in 1690 when the exiled James II was campaigning in Ireland, and the Vatican still claims it.

Founded in 1191, it became Anglican at the Reformation, so the Protestants had two cathedrals in the same city while the Catholics had none. It feuded with Christ Church over rights and precedence, until 1871 when Christ Church was nominated the senior church for Dublin and Glendalough and St Patrick's for the rest of Ireland. Jonathan Swift, author of Gulliver's Travels, was dean of St Patrick's from 1713 to 1745 and is buried here, as is his lady friend Stella Johnson. It was rebuilt in the 1860s into a confident pile of Victoriana, and anything that looks medieval is probably a 19th century concoction. Adult \u20ac10, conc \u20ac9.

The Royal Dublin Society is based here and promotes many cultural events. Get here on Bus 4 or 7, but it really ought to be an embassy limo.\nDonnybrook is separated from Ballsbridge by Herbert Park and is prosperous rather than opulent. It's best known for Donnybrook Fair, founded in 1204 and lasting until 1855 by which time it was a byword for drunkenness, fighting and hasty marriages. Yes, the bus will do for this area, the 46a.\nRanelagh and Dartry are also worth a look. Ranelagh is small but affluent, reached by the Luas Green line and with several well-regarded eateries.\nSandymount, a coastal suburb 3 km southeast of the centre, is an affluent area that was the birthplace of WB Yeats, and features prominently in James Joyce's Ulysses.

Patrick Pearse (1879-1916) saw Irish culture and language as essential for national independence. His one and only case as a barrister was his unsuccessful defence of a Donegal tradesman for using an \"illegible\" sign, and the verdict effectively made Irish signage illegal. He set up a language school in 1908, which moved here in 1910. He was also a leading Republican, reading the proclamation of independence on the GPO steps in the Easter Rising of 1916. He was court-martialled and shot nine days later. Free.

The Royal Canal bounds it to the south: this has a good towpath and is navigable all the way to the Shannon. (Remarkably, its backers lost even more money than those of the Grand Canal.) On its east side is Croke Park, the centrepoint of Gaelic sports. To the west it runs into Glasnevin, which has the National Botanic Gardens, Glasnevin Cemetery and good restaurants. Many bus routes come this way, and commuter trains towards  Maynooth stop at Drumcondra.\n32 Glasnevin Cemetery (Reilig Ghlas Na\u00edon), Finglas Rd D11 XA32 (Buses 9, 13, 40 from O'Connell St or 40a/40d from Parnell St), \u260f +353 1 882 6500. Daily 9AM-5PM. This opened as an RC cemetery in 1832, in an era when the Catholics weren't allowed their own parish churches, and their burials were begrudged affairs in Protestant ground. Glasnevin has grown and grown, expanding south across Finglas road into the St Paul's section, but the famous names are north side. You can visit the cemetery free, but to make sense of it go to the visitor centre (daily 10AM-5PM, closed M Tu in winter). Walking tours visit the graves of Daniel O'Connell, Charles Stewart Parnell, Michael Collins, Eamonn De Valera and many others of historic or architectural interest.

Here on 23 April 1014 was the battle at which Brian Boru defeated Leinster and their Viking allies but was killed himself. Clontarf has a 4.5-km promenade, traversed by Buses 104, 130 and 32X from the city, so it's a popular seaside outing. (Don't take the train, which runs inland.) St Anne's Park was the estate of the Guinness family home, and has ponds, follies, walks and a Rose Garden. Clontarf Island has disappeared beneath the waves, but in 2004 archaeologists were astounded by a Moai or Easter Island statue that now stands near the pier, until they read in the newspapers that it was a replica gifted by the government of Chile.\n34 Bull Island  is reached by two causeways. The South Bull and North Bull were sandbanks, and a confounded nuisance for navigation into Dublin; works to clear them began in the 18th century but the sea always won. In the 19th century a wall was built that funneled the estuary outflow, scouring the channel so the South Bull washed away while the North Bull grew into the present island. So it's not short of sand, and the 5 km Dollymount Strand is Dublin's best beach. The southern half of the island is a birdlife reserve and the north is St Anne's golf course. The south causeway from Clontarf, the \"Wooden Bridge\", was built in 1819 as a temporary access while the wall was built, but they decided to keep it: it's a single lane, traffic-light controlled. Causeway Road is the broader highway to mid-island.\n\n\n== Do ==\n \nSo Padraig comes for a job in construction, and the hiring boss says \"So can you tell me, what's the difference between a joist and a girder?\"\n\"Sure, everyone knows that.

Dublin city is famous for its characters. A great way to experience and live the city is by learning about it from people who are characters themselves - Dublin Tour Guides. Tours can vary from one to four hours in length and include, as well as the standard sightseeing tour, tours on topics like the paranormal and ghosts, music and song, literature, historical, 1916 Rising, and even Irish mythology. There are various walking tour companies and freelance tour guides available in Dublin. Anyone interested in geeky history should try the Ingenious Dublin tours, that cover history of medicine, Irish inventions (yes, there are lots!), great Irish scientists (lots of those too). They have walking tours and self-guided MP3 tours. \n Dublin Literary Pub Crawl, 'The Duke Pub', 9 Duke St, Dublin 2 (Just off Grafton St). 2. This is the most ingenious crash course in Irish literature, history, architecture and pub bonhomie yet devised... It combines street theatre with the 'craic' that makes Dublin pubs the liveliest in Europe. It is a highly enjoyable evening that gives you the pleasant notion of replacing brain cells as you drown them. The tour is a kind of rough guide to the cultural, religious and political life of the city. Performances by professional actors are central to the experience, not forgetting a fun-filled quiz with prizes for the winners. Can be a bit formal at times but this one's been going a long time and is well worth the experience for such an unusual tour.

The water of Vartry reservoir at Roundwood is commended in Joyce's Ulysses but the characters go boozing instead. Poulaphouca at Blessington was built later, and Sally Gap is the scenic road between the two catchments. \nPubs: it's reckoned that Dublin has over 600. You can but make a start. \nIn 2021 you might pay \u20ac6 for a pint, glass of wine or measure of spirits, somewhat more in Temple Bar. Pubs are generally open Su-Th to 23:00 and F Sa to 01:00 or later. Hours were curtailed during covid, the plus (which will likely remain) was that pubs increased their food offering, which meant they were \"restaurants\" and permitted to stay open - \"You must try our pizza!\" became a legally enforceable invitation. Smoking is illegal within all Irish pubs but many have a beer garden or similar outdoor smoking area.\nTemple Bar was named for the sand bar and mud flats along the south bank of the Liffey, reclaimed for building in the 17th century. \"Temple\" was both the name of the landowners, and of the Temple Bar district in London, with Essex St and Fleet St in the same respective positions. It's nowadays a tourist strip of cobbled alleys, drinking places, restaurants, more drinking places, shops, even more drinking places . . . it's very central so those stag and hen parties are probably just in for a quick one before heading to the Book of Kells or the big museums. Take care, but the sheer number of people on the streets gives you a measure of safety. \n\n\n=== Traditional Irish ===\n Peadar Kearney's, 64 Dame St D02 RT72 (Temple Bar), \u260f +353 1 670 6457.

(updated Jun 2024)\n\n\n== Stay safe ==\nDublin is a safe city by day, but keep your wits about you, especially as night draws on. The emergency number for all services is 999 or 112.\nTraffic: the city is congested, avoid bringing a car yourself, and never leave valuables on display in a car.\nMotorists often ignore pedestrian crossing lights. Maybe they're preoccupied with searching for a parking spot.\nStreet life: Buskers, drunks and down-and-outs are all part of the picaresque Dublin scene, and An B\u00e9al Bocht - \"the poor mouth\" - has a noble literary tradition. A polite \"sorry\" should see them off.\nGarda\u00ed (police officers) are happy to assist or give directions. If you fear for your safety and can't find or phone a Garda, head to the nearest shop, bar etc where you will be safe and can call. Pub doormen and bouncers will likewise call the police for you, they want to forestall trouble on their street.\nLGBTQ+ travellers: Dublin is usually not only safe but welcoming, however 2022 saw a 29% increase nationwide in hate crimes against LGBTQ+ people. Each Garda station has a Diversity Officer on duty, and the police are vigilant against all forms of hate crime. Support can also be obtained from Outhouse LGBTQ+ Centre on Capel Street, tel +353 1 873 4999.\nRough areas: Boardwalk, Lower Abbey Street and around Connolly station are tacky rather than unsafe by day, worth a swerve at night.\nYou have simply no reason to be in down-at-heel outlying districts such as Ballymun.\n\n\n== Cope ==\n\n\n=== Medical ===\nYou should only go to the hospital if you're too ill to get there, so to speak. For immediate treatment of minor ailments try one of the Walk-in Medical Centres. The most central are Dame Street Medical at 16 Dame St in Temple Bar, Abbey Street Centre at 71 Middle Abbey St, and 24Doc at North Wall behind the Customs House. They're private so an EHIC / GHIC card won't help. Expect to pay \u20ac60 for a consultation, plus the cost of any prescription or other treatment.\n\n\n=== Embassies ===\n  Argentina, 15 Ailesbury Drive, Ballsbridge D04 KF50, \u260f +353 1 269 1546.

Those listed here are all within an hour of the city. \n\nCounty Dublin:\n- Dun Laoghaire is the city's former harbour, and Dalkey is a prosperous seaside suburb with Riveria architecture.\n- Howth is a scenic peninsula. Boat trips sail to Ireland's Eye, teeming with bird life.\n- Malahide has a fine castle.

        "title": "Dubai",
        "extract": "Dubai (Arabic: \u062f\u0628\u064a\u200e\u200e Dubayy) is a cosmopolitan metropolis and global city on the Arabian Peninsula. The city is one of the ten most popular tourist destinations in the world. The city is also considered one of the most modern and progressive cities in the Middle East \u2013 certainly in the Arab world \u2013 and is also sometimes nicknamed as \"City of Gold\" due to historically being a hub for gold trade as well as the rapid transformation from a desert into a luxurious city.\nDubai is characterized by a vast landscape of desert which transforms into a futuristic style of skyscrapers along the coastline. The city offers both insights into the old merchant and pearl diving history of the Arabs in Deira and Bur Dubai and the new modern skyscraper business and bustling life in Jumeirah and Jebel Ali. Dubai is sometimes mistakenly thought of as a country, but it is actually one of the emirates that make up the United Arab Emirates. It is the financial centre of the United Arab Emirates.\nDubai is also considered a commercial and cultural hub of the Middle East, it's a global transport hub, and has attracted world attention through many large innovative construction projects and sports events. The city is symbolised by its skyscrapers, including the world's tallest building, Burj Khalifa, in addition to ambitious development projects including man-made islands, world-class luxury hotels, and some of the largest and extraordinarily modern shopping malls in the world.\n\n\n== Districts ==\n\n   \n  \n\n\n== Understand ==\n\n\n=== History ===\nDubai began as a small fishing village on the coast of the eastern Arabian Peninsula. At the beginning, the town made its income as a small pearl diving town. However, as expanding trade boomed across the gulf, it became a trading hub between Iran and India and gained a lot of notoriety for its imported goods from the East. In fact, the currency of Dubai used to be the Indian rupee historically. \nDubai was also used as a smuggling town to smuggle gold from Africa and elsewhere and import it to India, this made Dubai a well-known point in the map for various traders. When oil companies looked for oil around the Trucial States, Dubai was shown to not have any significant oil reserves compared to Abu Dhabi. Sheikh Rashid Al Maktoum, then the leader and Sheikh of Dubai, continued on the booming expansion of trade in Dubai instead of relying on any oil income. He welcomed Indian traders, Iranian traders, and even Western officials and travelers to his hometown. \nThe open policy of commerce and tolerance of foreigners made Dubai a willing destination for any non-Arab or non-Muslim, in stark contrast to other cities in the Arabian Peninsula, which viewed non-Muslims with suspicion. Sheikh Rashid's son, Sheikh Mohammed, had a vision of establishing Dubai as a Middle Eastern tourist destination. In his memoir, when he met with other GCC heads of state after the British withdrawal from the Gulf and proposed on making Dubai a tourist destination, the rest of the Sheikhs laughed at him. They told him nobody would like to come and visit a barren desert. Nevertheless, Sheikh Mohammed made the effort to hire experts and change the entire infrastructure of the city to welcome tourists, established free-zones with no taxes, invested in major tourism projects and opened the city for everyone regardless of race or religion. Multiple Western companies and institutions, wanting to expand their influence in the Middle East, welcomed Dubai's tax-free open-arm invitation. Dubai was seen as the only city in the Arabian Peninsula that would allow non-Muslims to live, drink, and enjoy their lives by their own laws and Western or non-Islamic standards, though it is now rivalled by nearby Doha and Abu Dhabi in this regard.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nThe city of Dubai is situated on a coastal strip bordered by desert and gets very hot in the summer. It is dry on the hottest days and humid during the cooler days in the summer. Cooler, more pleasant weather lasts from the end of September to the beginning of May (although pleasant is relative, with daily temperatures from October to January and March to May still being 20\u201325 \u00b0C (68\u201377 \u00b0F), but be prepared for cold night temperatures. In winter the temperature at night is usually from 10 to 16 \u00b0C (50 to 61 \u00b0F). From May to September, the sun is intense and in August temperatures can touch 54 \u00b0C (129 \u00b0F) in the city and even higher in the desert. The heat, coupled with a humidity of 60%\u201370% near the coast, effectively precludes most activity outdoors for the daylight hours during summer. Summer and winter are effectively the only two noticeable seasons the city experiences.\n\nDecember to April generally produces the highest precipitation, though little of it, at 100 mm (3.9 in) total per year. Some years yield no more than a few minutes of shower. Rain is celebrated in the UAE and most people take days off and some schools give rain days off to enjoy the little amount of precipitation the city experiences.\n\n\n=== Talk ===\nArabic is the official language, but as foreigners outnumber Emiratis by almost 4 to 1 in Dubai, English serves as the lingua franca. All signs are bilingual in Arabic and English and speaking Urdu, Hindi, or Tagalog will get you further than Arabic given that most retail and service staff are expatriates from Pakistan, India, and the Philippines.\n\n\n=== Visitor information ===\nVisit Dubai website\n\n\n== Get in ==\nSee the Get in section for the United Arab Emirates for visa and customs regulations.\n\n\n=== By plane ===\nDubai is a five-hour flight from Europe and three hours from most parts of the Middle East, the Near East, and the Indian subcontinent.\nDubai's main airport is the Dubai International Airport (DXB IATA). Its eventual replacement, Al Maktoum International Airport (DWC  IATA), is open to passenger flights but is only serving a few flights. You can also enter Dubai by using Sharjah International Airport (SHJ IATA) in the neighboring emirate of Sharjah.\n\nAirlines often have price wars to glamorous destinations like Dubai and this can work to your advantage by careful planning and comparison of the various airlines serving Dubai. Emirates is the flag carrier of the emirate of Dubai, and connects Dubai to over 100 destinations while FlyDubai is Dubai's low-cost carrier. Etihad has shuttle services from their exclusive check-in facility in Sheikh Zayed Rd or Central Business District of Dubai to and from Abu Dhabi Int'l Airport, you can also fly with Sharjah's low-cost carrier; Air Arabia which flies to over 46 destinations within the Middle East. Low fares from North America are most often found on Qatar Airways.\n\n1 Dubai International Airport (DXB IATA). This is the largest hub in the Middle East and the home base of Dubai's flag carrier Emirates and its low-cost wing flydubai. It has grown at such a furious pace that its terminals are bursting at the seams, especially during the peak hours around midnight. UAE and Gulf Cooperation Council nationals, UAE residents, and visa-on-arrival guests with biometric passports can use the Smart Gates after their initial arrival, during which they must first visit a staffed immigration counter.   \n2 Dubai World Central - Al Maktoum International Airport (DWC  IATA). The airport opened to passenger flights in October 2013 and has grand ambitions to be the largest airport in the world, capable of serving 160 million passengers a year. (For comparison, London Heathrow has around 70 million, and Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson has more than 100 million.) For the time being it's only served by several low-cost carriers such as Wizz Air and flydubai (other carriers usually operate seasonal charters from Europe). It is a major hub for cargo flights. Emirates is not planning to shift until 2025 or so. The airport is in Jebel Ali at the far western end of Dubai, nearly 60 km from central Dubai and about 110 km from Abu Dhabi. A train line is planned, but the current transport options are taxi and bus lines F55/F55A. F55 connects Al Maktoum Airport with Ibn Battuta Metro Station during the day, while F55A runs between Al Maktoum Airport and Al Satwa Bus Station during the night. Buses depart every hour from the airport.   \n3 Sharjah International Airport (SHJ IATA) (in the emirate of Sharjah). It is 30 min by road from Dubai and takes an increasing number of international flights as Dubai Airport struggles to keep up with demand. The principal carrier here is Air Arabia, a low-cost carrier serving the Middle East and South Asia. The airport is fairly basic but is being expanded. A bus service by Air Arabia also runs from the Airport to the Rashidiya Metro Station in Dubai. Rashidiya metro station is located close to the Dubai International Airport.   \n4 Zayed International Airport (AUH IATA) (in Abu Dhabi). There are ultra-low-cost flights from Europe, Africa and Asia. If you are somewhat flexible in your travel, you can get cheap intercontinental flight. There is an E102 bus service connecting Dubai (Ibn Battuta Bus Station) directly with Abu Dhabi Airport. It will cost 25 AED if you are using a nol card (cannot be purchased at Abu Dhabi Airport as of September 2022) or 35 AED if you buy a ticket at a counter at the Abu Dhabi Airport. \n\n\n=== By car ===\nDubai's only international road border is with Oman at Al Wajajah. Expatriate residents of Oman will require an official permit to exit Oman by road.  Visitors do not require a permit. There is a charge per vehicle to exit Oman and, if returning, retain the charge receipt as it will be required to re-enter.  Ensure that insurance is valid for the UAE (preferably before commencing the journey). Temporary UAE insurance can be purchased at the border for a premium price.\nThere are also road borders between the neighbouring Emirate of Abu Dhabi and Oman at the Al Burami Oasis which divides the sister cities of Al Ain and Al Burami, Oman.\nDubai is a very car-oriented city and most visitors will choose to take taxis instead of the public transportation system. You can easily find them in the taxi queue or you just simply wave at one on the road, but this could be just difficult during rush hours. Also, some of them even refuse short rides in jammed areas.\nSignage is terrible in Dubai, and taxis often get lost.  The best thing to do is navigate from well-known landmarks, such as hotels.  GPS devices are often outdated. Street and road names can be very confusing, because the different transliterations from Arabic, you will notice that the slight variance in the spelling is very important.\nYou can find a lot of car rental agencies that will give you a vehicle with very cheap rates and only an International Driving Permit, if you don't have an UAE one. Some agencies also offer a car hire service with drivers, an option much more comfortable for visitors, especially if the driver speaks English and knows the way around the city better than most taxi drivers.\nSome of the best car rental companies are: Careem Car Services, which offers an easy booking system with a real-time tracking app and, if you need it, you can hire a car with a child seat. Ahdab International Luxury Transport is a highly experienced team of professionals but their rates tend to be quite expensive.\n\n\n=== By bus ===\nThe Government of Dubai operates a network of buses linking Dubai city with the capitals of the other six emirates of the UAE. The buses run under the name Emirates Express and operate from various bus terminals in Dubai, for timetables see the website.\n\nFrom Abu Dhabi: Buses operate every 40 minutes starting at 06:20 from Abu Dhabi's main bus station to Dubai's Al Ghubaibah or Ibinu Bathutha bus station. The two-hour journey costs 25 dirham.\nFrom Sharjah: Frequent buses run between Dubai and Sharjah. There are several different routes and buses depart from various bus stations in Dubai including Al Karama, Gold Souq, Baniyas Square, Jebel Ali and Al Ittihad Square.\nFrom Al Ain: Buses operate every hour from Dubai's Al Ghubaibah bus station. It's a two-hour journey.\nTo/from Fujairah: The bus to Fujairah leaves from the Rashidiya Metro station and takes about 3 to 4 hours.\nFor bus travel from Saudi Arabia, SAPTCO offers daily bus services from cities such as Dammam and Riyadh.\n\n\n=== By boat ===\nDubai is a trading hub for dhows from around the Indian Ocean. Travellers wanting to arrive in the city this way will probably need to make their own arrangements with the captain of the vessel. Most of the dhows sail to Iran; some also head to Yemen and Somalia. Emulating Michael Palin and heading to India on a dhow is difficult-to-impossible.\nDubai has an international cruise terminal at Port Rashid. During wintertime, Costa Cruises has bases at least two of its cruise ships (Costa Luminosa & Costa Fortuna) in Dubai.\nValfajr Shipping Company runs a boat service that leaves Bandar Lengeh and Bandar Abbas in Iran supposedly every second day and docks in Port Rashid in Dubai, returning the following day. Crossing the Persian Gulf takes roughly 6 hours. The ticket includes Iranian-style lunch.\n\n\n== Get around ==\nDubai's public transport system is probably the best in the Middle East, especially after the launch of the metro, but it's still a very car-oriented city and most visitors end up taking taxis quite often.  The Wojhati journey planner can suggest the best way to travel.\nMost visitors buy a rechargeable NOL Red Ticket which is the most straightforward option for tourists who only need to use the metro and busses once or twice a day. There is a day pass valid for unlimited rides on the metro, tram and buses which makes sense if you plan on doing more than 3-5 journeys per day. The NOL Silver Card stored-value card gives a discount on both metro and bus fares. The Silver card is useful for public transport users who stay in Dubai for more than a day. Both cards are available at metro stations and major bus stations. Tap out at the end of your trip in buses - even with a day pass.\n\n\n=== Fares ===\n\n\n=== By metro ===\n\nDubai Metro has two lines which are open as of 2025:\nThe Red Line is 52 km (32 mi) long and opened in September 2009. It's the second metro in the Arab world after Cairo. While the line does not serve the old city centre, it's handy for zipping along Dubai's long coastline and includes stops at the airport, Burj Khalifa and the Mall of the Emirates. The track 2020 expo - an extension of the Red Line - was completed in 2020.\nThe Green Line, which burrows through the city core, opened in September 2011. You can transfer between the two lines at Union Square and Khalid Bin Al Waleed (BurJuman).\nThere is a third metro line called the Blue line under construction with a planned opening date in 2029.\nA rechargeable ticket (NOL Red Card) cost starts at 2 dirhams for the card itself and 4 dirhams for a trip within one zone, 6 dirham for two zones, etc. Tickets can be purchased in automated machines, ticket offices or at the gate information clerk. Cash and payment cards are accepted (Visa and MasterCard). Trains run every 3\u20135 minutes from 05:50 to midnight every day except Thursday and Friday, when services are extended to 05:50\u201301:00 limited to 13:00\u201323:59, respectively. All stations are air-conditioned and there's a large network of feeder buses. If you plan to travel late in the evening, check station working hours as the last train may depart earlier than the official system operating hours.\nBe aware that the Metro is typically overcrowded almost any time of day between Union Station in Deira and Dubai Marina. Finding a seat is nearly impossible, and even the Gold Class is often so packed that passengers must stand for most of the journey.\n\n\n=== By monorail ===\nA 5 km (3.1 mi) monorail system shuttles passengers across the Palm Jumeirah to the Atlantis hotel. It connects with the Dubai Tram. This is not a part of the rest of Transport, and therefore, you will need to buy a separate ticket (15 dirham one-way and 25 dirham return).\n\n\n=== By tram ===\n\nThe latest of Dubai's modern transportation system is the Dubai Tram, which opened on November 12, 2014. It provides commuters with a comfortable transit service around the prime business and leisure districts of Dubai. The Dubai Tram operates for 19 hours daily running for 14.5 km along Al Sufouh Road. It passes around the vibrant Dubai Marina where passengers are treated to breathtaking sights of towering skyscrapers and luxury yachts, and then travels down Jumeirah passing by the iconic Burj Al Arab.\nThe Dubai Tram connects with the Dubai Metro at the Jumeirah Lakes Towers and DAMAC stations, and links with the monorail of Palm Jumeirah. Outside of Europe, the Dubai Tram is the first tram system that uses the state-of-the-art ground-level power supply cable system which eliminates the unsightly and overhead cables.\n\n\n=== By bus ===\nDubai Public transport  is a cheaper means of travelling within the several districts of Dubai. A map of the bus system can be found online, as well as detailed route maps and timetables. Public buses are clean and cheap, but unfortunately not very comprehensive and (on some routes) quite infrequent. The bus system is most useful for getting between different areas of central Dubai, or between the various suburbs, rather than general transport. Taxis or a fair amount of walking will also be required if you visit Dubai without a car of your own.\nYou will require a Nol card or ticket for fare payment. Cards can be purchased from most bus stations, metro stations, and sometimes from the bus driver.\nThe main bus stations are Gold Souq Market (in Deira) and Al Ghubaiba bus station (in Bur Dubai). Clear route maps and timetables are placed inside a few bus stands. Ramadan timings differ. The front seats are reserved for women.\nProbably the single most useful service for the casual tourist is Line 8, which starts at the Gold Souq, takes the tunnel under the Creek to Heritage Village, and then sets off down Jumeirah Rd (just behind the beach) and all its hotels and malls, up to Burj al-Arab and Wild Wadi. It terminates near the Internet City, while its 8A variant goes down a little further and also serves the Mall of the Emirates.\n\n\n=== By taxi ===\nTaxis ply the streets of Dubai and are relatively easy to spot with their cream bodies and coloured roofs. The easiest place to find them is at the taxi queue at one of the malls or outside a hotel. Taxis can also be booked on the Careem mobile app which is similar to Uber. Waving down a taxi on the road is possible, but can be difficult during rush hours. At peak times (07:00-09:00 & 16:00-19:00 workdays, and Friday evenings) demand exceeds supply, and not only are taxis hard to find, but those who deign to pick you up may demand crazy off-meter fares or refuse short rides in congested areas entirely. If you accept an off-meter quote, ensure that the driver clearly says 'Dirhams' as occasionally the word metamorphoses into 'Dollars' when you reach your destination. Also, the drivers of Dubai Taxi Corporation go through their shift change between 16:00-18:00 daily and it can be more difficult to find taxis during this time. The standard of driving in Dubai ranges from poor to wild - taxis are some of the worst on the roads.\nTaxis are metered at 2.19 dirham/km day and night, so no haggling is necessary. The rates of all taxi companies \u2014 Dubai Transport, National, Cars, Metro, and Arabian \u2014 are identical, so just take the first one that comes along. Street pickups attract a standing charge of 5 dirham during the day and 5.50 dirham at night (22:00-06:00). From the airport, there is a standing charge of 25 dirham; there is a surcharge for going to Sharjah. A minimum total fare of 12 dirham applies. Taxis are exempt from the Salik road toll charges.\nBeware of unmarked hotel taxis and limousines though: while some of these are metered, they are not tied to the official rates, and can be much more expensive. One way to spot whether a taxi is official or not is to look for a meter: no meter, don't get in.\nIf you can't find one otherwise, you can attempt to call Dubai Taxi on 04-2080808 (each franchise has its own booking number but one central system), there's a surcharge to book. The booking system was notorious for its unreliability but with a significantly increased taxi fleet, many taxis now deliberately wait in unofficial holding areas waiting for bookings. As a result, on a good day it can be possible to book a taxi and have it arrive within less than five minutes. If you absolutely have to get somewhere at a certain time (say, the airport or a meeting), it's still best to book a hotel taxi in advance, and get their estimate of how bad the traffic will be.\nWomen should travel in the back of the taxi as some drivers see it as a sexual invitation if you get in the front.\nTaxi drivers are usually friendly, but may have a different ideas on hygiene.\nYou can also use Careem or Uber services for moving in Dubai.\n\n\n=== By car ===\nThere are countless rent-a-cars that will provide a mode of transportation for very cheap rates and very little paperwork. An International Driving Permit is not necessarily required, but hire companies may not rent a car without one.\nSome agencies will hire out cars complete with drivers. Visitors taking advantage of this option will need to make certain that their driver knows his way around as many do not.\nWhen driving on the main roads, such as Sheikh Zayed Road, the junction numbers are not in logical order. Junction 13 is just after Junction 18 and is rarely shown on the maps. Road names can also be very confusing with slight differences in spelling (due to different transliterations from Arabic) being very important. The construction work that is taking place throughout and around Dubai can make finding your destination a challenge. Temporary road layouts change with alarming regularity and temporary signs can be misleading or non-existent. As GPS maps are not up to date (and usually not anyway available to rent with hire cars), you will be very well off with a printed map (you can get an excellent one in Virgin stores, for example. There is a Virgin Megastore on the top floor of City Center).\nDriving during morning and afternoon peak hours is not recommended, as traffic slows to a standstill and even a simple trip across a bridge can take up to 45 minutes. There is also a scarcity of parking spaces in many parts of the city.\nWith such a mixture of nationalities residing in the city, driving styles are mixed, to say the least. Both dangerous and experienced driving will be witnessed or experienced frequently. Dubai has one of the highest per capita road death rates in the world. There is zero tolerance for alcohol and driving with stiff penalties meted out including jail and deportation.\nSee Salik for information about tolls on certain routes in Dubai. If you rent a car, usually a Salik tag will be provided by the car hire company and you will be charged separately when returning the car.\n\n\n=== By boat ===\n\nAn easy way of crossing Dubai Creek is by abra, a small ferry. Abra stations are located along the Creek on both the Bur Dubai and Deira sides, and the system of filling the boats is remarkably efficient. The cross-river trip is payable to the driver after the boat has left the station, and affords a very picturesque view of the city. Abras set off very regularly, and the service is available round-the-clock.\nAir-conditioned water buses are a way to avoid the abra crowd and the heat. They are part of the public transport system, so a Red Nol ticket or a Nol card is required. Tickets can be purchased at the water bus station.\nThe water bus also features a 'tourist route' round trip \u2013 while it is convenient, it can get quite expensive.\nThe Creek is also the home of many boats offering more comfortable (and correspondingly more expensive) tours, often in boats designed to resemble dhows. Prices tend to be higher, particularly for dinner cruises with on-board entertainment.\n\n\n=== By bicycle ===\nWhile not at all a bicycle-friendly city, there is a growing network of cycle lanes. Careem offers a bike sharing system with stations in Dubai Marina, Jumeirah Beach, downtown, Palm Jumeirah, Deira and a number of other districts. It costs 20 AED per 24 hours with as many 45-minute rides as you want. A phone with a data plan and a credit card is needed though.\n\n\n== See ==\nIndividual listings can be found in Dubai's district articles\n\nDubai is a mixture of old and new, traditional and modern. From old traditional souks and historical buildings (now being preserved for cultural reasons or already part of the national heritage) to modern Dubai's overwhelming shopping malls, incredible artificial islands and giant modern skyscrapers that include the world's tallest building, Dubai is a world in itself and offers plenty of wonderful attractions.\nThe city has numerous museums and historical buildings, but Dubai Museum is a must see for a first-time traveller to the Emirates. It provides a glimpse of the old life of Dubai, its people and their culture and heritage. A number of other museums are located in nearby Sharjah.\nDubai has a justified reputation as a concrete jungle, but there are nice pockets of greenery within the city, such as Safa Park. The city parks are modern and very well-maintained, with the most popular located in Jumeirah.\n\n\n== Do ==\nIndividual listings can be found in Dubai's district articles\n\nAbra ride. A boat ride is best done at night in the cool weather and to enjoy the city lights. Abras can be hired for a private tour (for a price negotiable with the driver, but usually very cheap). This is quite a popular activity at sunset on a clear day, particularly if the driver is able to enliven the tour with stories about the structures on either side of the Creek. Just make sure that the purpose of one's abra hire is made clear at the outset, otherwise, you will be in for a very expensive cross-river trip or a crowded private tour.\nBeaches and sea. There are endless water sports opportunities as Dubai has some of the whitest and sandiest beaches in the world. Ocean temperatures range from 22 \u00b0C (72 \u00b0F) in winter up to 35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F) in summer, there are few wave breaks and the strong winds can make swimming difficult. The water is also very salty so many prefer to use their hotel swimming pool. Diving activities have been severely affected by offshore construction work for the Palms and The World; consequently, long boat trips are necessary to reach wreck sites. Alternatively, one can make the 90-minute road journey to the East coast Emirate of Fujairah or the Sharjah enclave, Khor Fakkan, for top-class diving on coral reefs supporting extensive marine life.\nCamel race track. One of the more unusual attractions, with races being held on Thursday and Friday in the winter. You can watch the races, and you'll have the opportunity to visit the paddocks. Vendors sell everything from beads to rugs and blankets, so you can purchase souvenirs.\nHorse racing has a long tradition in the Arab world, and Dubai's Meydan Racecourse is one of the most famous horse racing venues in the world, holding races for both Thoroughbred and purebred Arabian horses. Gambling is illegal, so there are no on-site betting facilities, but the grandstand is a marvel of modern architecture, and particularly spectacular when lit up at night.\nDesert safari or dune bashing. Head out to the desert in an SUV with specialist desert drivers. The drivers will take you for a thrilling roller-coaster ride over sand dunes, show you the sunset from a strategic vantage point and then take you to a traditional Arabic Bedouin campsite where you'll be offered lavish barbecue buffet dinner with music and belly dance to complete the atmosphere. The duration of the tour is usually around five hours. You may want to stay clear of the dune bashing if you get carsick easily. A desert safari is one of the best things to do while in Dubai. Another option would be renting/buying a 4x4 and joining the many growing 4x4 clubs in the UAE, but only if you're an extremely experienced driver and hold an international driving license. Neighboring cities including Abu Dhabi also have their own, such as AD4x4. For all of the Dubai-based clubs, membership is free of charge and they conduct trips for beginners into the desert on a regular basis.\nNatural outdoors. Although at first glance the outdoors may seem dull and uninteresting, and even dangerous due to the desert conditions, there are actually amazing natural destinations in the Emirate of Dubai, which extends into Hatta. There are pristine waterfalls, cliffs lined with fossils, and even freshwater lakes.\nYacht charter is an easy way to explore the man-made Palm Islands and coastal skyscrapers. Fleets are available for hire from Dubai Marina from many of the yacht charter agencies.\nDubai Creek cruise. Dubai Creek is the foundation from which Dubai grew. It was built as a port for trading vessels plying to and from India, Africa and the Middle East. Today a bit of the old shipping culture still remains. In and around the Creek one can see some of the original buildings that have served as customs houses and defence structures. You can book a ride (usually four hours) on the Dubai Marina cruise or rent a private boat to take you on an hour-long ride up and down the Creek.\nBurj Khalifa: Visit the tallest building in the world with the magnificent centrepiece of Dubai, Burj Khalifa is surrounded by hotels, must-visit shopping destinations and a world of entertainment options.\nGolf. It may be a desert, but a lot of money and water is spent on irrigating opulent golf courses. Alternatively, for a more local flavour, try sand golf.\nThe Dubai International Film Festival is the city's not-for-profit cultural event. As a major festival for Arab cinema, it showcases a selection of films from the Middle East, Africa and Asia.\n\n\n== Work ==\n\nWhile Dubai tries to promote itself as the business and entertainment capital of the world, the government has a complex and at times frustrating work permit procedure that the inexperienced should not attempt on their own. It is best to go through official channels when looking for work in Dubai as spot inspections are frequent and if found working illegally, both the employee and the employer will be subject to fines and even deportation.\nAll the necessary forms and documents are written and processed in Arabic and is best left to a professional intermediary agency. These go by the name of \"Government liaison officer\" / \"Public relations officer\" (nothing like a PR in the general context) and offer so-called \"PRO services\".\nWith the price of rentals soaring in Dubai and neighbouring Emirates, it is a good idea to discuss a housing allowance when negotiating remuneration.\nDespite all of this, there are a few upsides, Dubai companies are generous with holidays averaging almost 39 paid vacation days a year (including public holidays), a round trip ticket home once a year (depending on your contract) and the UAE government does not impose income taxes on foreign workers.  Instead it imposes fees and charges on almost everything, so the cost of living in the UAE, and especially Dubai, is quite high.\nRecruitment fraud is quite pervasive in this part of the world. Read your employment contract carefully before signing and do not pay any fees to recruitment agencies, as they are usually paid by the companies. Your passport is your personal property and cannot be withheld by the employer unless you are in a position of trust or are handling large sums of money.\nDubai-based companies have been accused by numerous organizations of effectively enslaving poor migrant workers from Southeast Asia by taking their passports and not paying them the promised salaries. Foreign workers, Western and otherwise, have no rights that will be upheld by the courts, and so they have no recourse should they feel their rights violated. Potential workers should be aware of this when considering work in Dubai.\n\n\n== Buy ==\nIndividual listings can be found in Dubai's district articles\n\nDubai is practically synonymous with shopping and could be called \"Do buy\". Low tariffs and a huge amount of cargo passing through its port ensure that practically anything is available at fairly competitive rates, although the appreciation of the Dirham and the plentiful supply of shoppers means that Dubai is no longer a bargain basement shopping city. You'll also find products in Western chain stores, still with the original tags quoting euro or sterling prices, being sold with a 20\u201330% mark-up once converted to dirhams. The best things to buy are textiles, electronics and gold; electronics are believed to be much cheaper, while there is a wide selection of textiles and gold.\nDubai shops suffer from the standard developing world shopping phenomenon of having no storeroom and no stocks in reserve, even in the mega-malls \u2013 and for clothes shopping this may mean that you struggle to find the style you want in the size you want.  Shops open as early as 09:00 and stay open until 22:00, and on weekends to midnight or 01:00.\nRemember to haggle in the souks, as discounts are almost always available and even in situations where the item will not become much cheaper, the customer is always expected to \"play the game\" of haggling. A simple question of \"What's your best price?\" will often result in a shopkeeper going to extraordinary lengths to sell his stock. Prices in the malls and other Western shops tend not to be negotiable. Far from being a bad thing, this allows the canny visitor to work out comparative prices for common souvenirs \u2013 an invaluable aid when a shopkeeper in a souk is asking for a higher price.\nDubai Shopping Festival has been the biggest shopping event in the Middle East since 1996. Almost every shop has a sale, starting in January and ending in February. The DSF is not limited to Shopping but also produces some mind-blowing stages shows and performances performed by international celebrities. There's also a very similar Dubai Summer Surprises trying to pull in punters during the summer low season.\n\n\n=== Souvenirs ===\n\n\"Dubai chocolate\", filled with pistachio paste and crunchy kadayif (shredded filo), was only invented in 2021 but went viral soon afterwards. The original is Fix Dessert's \"Can't Get Knafeh Of It\", available only by delivery and in very limited quantities, but imitators abound.\n\n\n=== Malls ===\n\nDubai is known for its gigantic malls and is a magnet for shoppers. Among the dozens of malls, two stand out due to their size and quality. See the district articles for more details on malls. Several malls have a large supermarket where you'll find the lowest cost electronics, and groceries for self-catering. There are many supermarkets, and international brands such as Carrefour, G\u00e9ant and Waitrose have multiple locations as do 'home-grown' brands Choithrams, Spinney's, Union Co-Operative and Lulu, amongst others.\n\n\n== Eat ==\nIndividual listings can be found in Dubai's district articles\n\nShawarma is the most available food item on almost all streets (and cheap) in Dubai. It is the Arabic equivalent of the burger. It is meat that has been cooked on a skewer and then cut into thin strips and placed into a kuhbus (pita) bread with vegetables and dressing. There is the plain-jane variety and the more exotic Lebanese and Iranian varieties. The shawarma sold by Indian restaurants are arguably the cheapest.\nAnother local snack is fala-fil (felafel, falafel), which is as cheap as shawarma.\nTraditional Emirati food normally involves rice and meat/chicken cooked with different spices. As such, mandi is a very popular meal and generally affordable, except when served in high end restaurants. Emirati restaurants can be mostly found in areas with local residents, such as Deira, Bur Dubai and Jumeirah. Traditional desserts are also worth trying. Search for luqaimat, deep fried dough balls tossed with date syrup on top. You'll find it at any Emirati restaurant as well as some small cafeterias or street markets.\nMost of the American fast food chains have set up shop, including KFC, Chillis, TGI Fridays, Starbucks, and McDonalds. The beauty of the food in Dubai is that you will probably find cuisine for every taste. All food is halal.\nDubai has a big selection of budget Indian food. Dosa, vada, idlee, samosa, chapaati/roti, with generous servings of sabji (cooked vegetable stew) are available for cheap. Bur Dubai (particularly Meena Bazaar area) and Karama are the places that abound in these restaurants. Most of them are open from 07:00 to 22:00 or 23:00 throughout the week.\n\nPork is eaten here mostly by non-Muslim Filipinos and Europeans. Pork sections exclusive for non-Muslims are found in Spinneys (numerous branches, including ones in Jumeirah and Dubai Marina), Al Maya Lal's (generally caters to Filipinos; there's a branch in Satwa) New Westzone Supermarket (has a branch in Satwa that's bigger than nearby rival Al Maya Lal's), Choithrams and Waitrose.\nDuring Ramadan, while it is not illegal for non-Muslims to eat and drink in public spaces during daylight hours, it's better to avoid doing so out of respect for those fasting. Most restaurants remain open as normal. Once the sun sets though, many locals will gather for iftar, or the breaking of the fast, and many hotels will serve elaborate iftar meals catering to this market. As a tourist, you are welcome to partake too, but be sure to reserve in advance as these are very popular.\nDubai hosts several food festivals in the spring (March - May). The largest is the Dubai Food Festival which lasts for two weeks. Across the city, there are discounts at restaurants and home / kitchen stores (such as Crate & Barrel, Williams Sonoma, etc.) World-class chefs offer master classes, special collaborations, and tasting menus.\n\n\n=== Budget ===\nMost malls have food courts, which offer good value menus and are a fast and reliable option for visitors and locals. There are also several food chains of many different types (Pakistani, Indian, Western) scattered all over the city. See the district articles for individual recommendations.\n\n\n=== Mid-range ===\nAutomatic, this is a chain of popular Lebanese restaurants found all over Dubai. Famous for its lamb chops & Friday lunch buffet. No alcohol served.\n\n\n=== Splurge ===\nThe top hotels all have at least one restaurant serving (most commonly) some form of international cuisine - Italian, Japanese, Indian and so on. Quality tends to be high, along with price, but non-guests are able to reserve tables as well, thus allowing the rest of us to experience a bit of these hotels. Floating restaurants for dinner come sight seeing in Dubai Marina are also popular among both non-travelers and travelers. And agencies have licensed floating restaurants and hence charge a high price for the quality of food and service.\n\n\n== Drink ==\n\nIndividual listings can be found in Dubai's district articles\nDubai has supercharged the nightlife in the last decade and most international known brands have a sister location in town. Most 3-5 star hotels have bars and nightclubs for those interested in the nightlife. World-class DJs frequent Dubai's nightclubs, and many A-list musical celebrities are adding Dubai to their list of tour dates. There is nothing missing and during the high tides of the party time, the impression of being in Ibiza is not misleading. Most of the night life is geared at the beaches of Jumeirah or the Dubai Marina. Bur Dubai is more family-oriented (e.g. Dubai Fountain), while Deira was able in parts to maintain its more Arabic focussed style. Dubai is very popular with Arabic travellers, so an Arabic blend is added quite often.\nDubai has several laws regarding alcohol which travelers should be aware of:\n\nAlcohol is available only at licensed premises, usually attached to hotels (most nightclubs and bars are in or attached to hotels, though they may have separate entrances).  As of 2023 there is one public cinema that serves alcohol (Cinema City's Azul Lounge & Theatre), as well as a few private cinemas that can be booked for groups.\nAlcohol is not sold on religious holidays. From 2016, it can be sold during Ramadan.\nIt is illegal to drink alcohol in public places, and there is a zero-tolerance policy on drunk driving.  Anyone involved in a collision found with alcohol in their blood will usually get a month's jail sentence and fine.\nAlcohol can be bought only for home consumption at certain outlets in Dubai, and an alcohol license is required.  Supermarkets only stock non-alcoholic beers.  Even food items containing alcohol are not sold in supermarkets.\nRemember to carry some sort of identification when visiting a bar if you are young, as you will not be let in otherwise. The law prohibits anyone below 21 to enter.\nThe authorities take disruptive behavior while intoxicated very seriously, which will lead to jail time or deportation.\nProstitution is illegal but can be seen in bars. Both parties act illegally, but in rather (in-)famous clubs it can be rather obvious. Keep in mind that most hotels have a strict guest policy.\n\n\n== Sleep ==\nIndividual listings can be found in Dubai's district articles\nDue to substantial increase in hotel rooms, only during Islamic holidays do prices rise substantially. The cheapest places, mainly catering to small-scale businessmen, can be found in near the souks of Deira. In Dubai you find a youth hostel and several backpacker hostels.\nSee the individual listings in the districts for hotel recommendations. In general tourists tend to stay at the beach hotels in Jumeirah or Jebel Ali, while city dwellers have ample choice in Deira or Bur Dubai. Dubai is a stretch along the coastline and taxis are cheap and the metro reliable, so there are always alternative options. The only hassles are ever-new construction sites and the rush hour. During the summer heat a hotel with access to a mall or shopping complex is beneficial to have a greater area for air conditioned walking.\nThere are luxury glamping resorts in the desert far from the city. The most well known is Terra Solis. Reservations need to be made more than a month in advance, even in summer. As of 2023, the cheapest type of accommodation (tents) cost 950 dirham per night on weeknights and 1400 dirham per night on weekends.\nFor long trips (a month or more), the Rove hotel collection offers summer rates from 4000 dirham per month with significant discounts on F&B, laundry, and Lets work membership (co-working space). This is cheaper than the monthly rent for an unfurnished 1-bedroom apartment in a popular neighborhood, and Dubai residents will take advantage of this if they happen to be between leases or to help a friend who has newly moved to the city.\n\n\n== Stay safe ==\nDubai is a safe city. Call 999 if facing any trouble or altercations.\n\n\n=== Traffic ===\nDriving and pedestrian safety has also been an issue given the different nationalities that share the road. Do not jaywalk or cross where there are no clear pedestrian markings. Speeding is common here, and the odds of you being hit by a car are quite high unless you follow the rules. Avoid driving on the extreme left lane of highways to avoid being \"flashed\" and being forced to move a lane over. Road rage is also starting to become an issue given the increase in traffic jams and poor driving courtesy.\nRude hand gestures (the \"finger\", etc.) and profanity can lead to fines and jail times if reported, so keep your cool if you are cut off or are behind an erratic driver. In general, you will find those gestures and actions that some may find only slightly offensive in your home country, or perhaps not offensive at all, can at times be extremely offensive to the Dubai locals. Therefore, err on the side of caution and keep your cool.\n\n\n=== Islamic laws ===\nThe United Arab Emirates might seem to have more relaxed laws than their other Arab counterparts, but the laws are still very different from most Western countries, and their laws are strictly enforced. Having an alcoholic drink in the wrong place or even losing your temper could land you a month or more in prison. Exercise caution and common sense when visiting, and make sure you are aware of all their laws or expect severe consequences that could seriously ruin your visit.\nDubai strictly follows Islamic laws which should be respected by all visitors. Islam is the official religion, therefore do not publicly criticize or distribute material against it.\nIn conversations about politics and world affairs, avoid criticizing the ruling family of any of the seven Emirates or prominent business families. The United Arab Emirates has formal relations with Israel but publicly supports causes that involve the Palestinian people and Palestinian statehood.\nPublic displays of affection are frowned upon and public sexual acts can lead to prison sentences followed by deportation. In 2008, a British couple were arrested and faced prison sentences because they had sexual contact on a beach in Dubai. If all tourists remain respectful, decent and ensure that they do not upset the local people, there should be no problems.\nHomosexuality is a criminal offence with possible imprisonment and deportation. Egregious public displays of affection or cross-dressing may lead to prison sentences and/or deportation. In 2013 a Norwegian woman reported she had been raped but then, following bad advice, rescinded it. She was then sentenced to 16 months in prison for extramarital sex and filing a false police report. After public pressure she was pardoned and deported. As of January 2022, extramarital sex has been decriminalized.\nWomen should dress sensibly and avoid wearing revealing outfits when travelling to districts like Karama, Deira and Bur Dubai, where the streets are packed with men, especially on evenings and weekends. While swimsuits and bikinis are a common sight on Dubai beaches, avoid sunbathing topless \u2014even in the private beach of a hotel.\nProstitution is illegal in Dubai but still it is visible at nightclubs, bars and other places. Law enforcement ignores solicitation to a degree, but penalties are high if it is made too obvious or if the police are called. Human trafficking and forced prostitution are real issues in Dubai.\n\n\n=== Petty crime ===\nWhile petty crime is hardly reported or mentioned in the news, keep an eye on your wallet or purse when in crowded areas like Naser Square or Deira in general. If withdrawing large amounts of cash from ATMs, either conceal the notes or ask the bank's security to escort you to your vehicle. Cases have occurred where people have been robbed of large amounts of cash in crowded areas because they were not careful.\nConmen are ever present in Dubai, especially the \"Nigeria 419\" scammers. Do not arrange meetings or entertain their requests or give any personal details. Should they not comply, individuals who will be happy to listen to their business propositions are the police.\nThanks to Dubai's new property boom and bust, real estate fraudsters are also popping up, so exercise extreme caution if you are interested in buying or renting.\nDrug use and distribution are serious criminal offences, even when in the company of the person consuming the material, and can lead to a prison sentence of several years or even the death penalty. Passenger baggage is screened quite thoroughly when entering Dubai. Even prescription drugs (without original prescription note and sometimes even with one) or ones that you bought over the counter in your country can lead to a prison sentence.\nYou need to be careful when you are a tourist in Dubai, like many places around the world, people have a keen eye for tourists and can cheat you. For example, taxi drivers can drive a longer way to the destination given that you pay by meter or try to charge you US$20 when you are sure you heard them say 20 dirham (they do sound rather similar).\n\n\n== Connect ==\nSee United Arab Emirates#Connect for details of Internet and mobile connectivity in Dubai, including restrictions on popular services internet telephony services like WhatsApp.\nGSM \u2013 Those with GSM smartphones or feature phones can expect auto roaming from their home countries. As roaming fees are quite high and incoming calls are also charged, consider buying a local prepaid GSM SIM card, designed especially for tourists, from one of the two cellular providers of the UAE:\n\nEtisalat - product Ahlan - available at the Duty Free Shop (arrival hall) of Dubai Airport\nDu - product Visitor Mobile Line - available at the Telefonika kiosk in the arrival hall of Dubai Airport. Incoming calls are free of charge.\nPhone booths \u2013 Phone booths are located on most streets. Phone cards can be purchased from hotels and tourist shops.\nInternet \u2013 Internet caf\u00e9s can be hard to find. There are a number of caf\u00e9s on Al Musalla Rd/Al Mankhool Rd in Bur Dubai, including one at 38 Al Musalla Rd and one at Computer Plaza next to the Ramada Hotel. A number of Internet cafes are found in Satwa too. In Satwa there is the French Connection in the Al Wafa Tower on Sheikh Zayed Rd (opposite side of road from the Dusit Hotel), which has wi-fi access and nice cakes and pastries. In Al Qusais, there is an internet caf\u00e9 a 5-minute walk northwest of the Dubai Youth Hostel. Turn right out of the gates and walk to LuLu's Hypermarket. The caf\u00e9 is located inside the food court.\nGaming cafes aimed at teenagers are dotted around, notable examples including Escape gaming zone (opposite Lulu Hypermarket hypermarket in al Barsha), Que Club in al Barsha and behind Lamcy Plaza.\nSurprisingly, the malls do not have internet caf\u00e9s. Dubai Mall offers free Wi-Fi throughout.  Mall of the Emirates offers free Wi-Fi, but you must have a local phone number.  Many coffee-shops, restaurants and attractions also have free Wi-Fi, and you'll usually have to ask for the password.  Most hotel business centers are equipped with internet caf\u00e9s but are expensive.\nEtisalat, UAE's telecom operator, offers a roaming, postpaid Wi-Fi internet connection known as iZone . Most coffee shops and malls across Dubai provide this service. Prices are available on the website. For those still using dial-up internet Etisalat provide a service when you can plug into any phone line.\nDubai International Airport (DXB) has free Wi-Fi in the terminal. Bring your laptop to use free Wi-Fi at some hotels.\nThere are many free public Wi-Fi spots in Dubai.\n\n\n=== Post service ===\nEmirates Post service is pretty efficient. You will need to rent a post office box as postal service to the door is not the standard.\n\n\n=== Newspapers and radio ===\nThanks to the large influx of expatriates, Dubai has a wide selection of English-language newspapers and radio channels.\n\nThe Gulf News.\nTime Out Dubai - Things to do.\nThe Khaleej Times.\nThe Gulf Today.\nThe National.\n7 Days.\nEmirates Business 24/7.\nChannel 4 - Plays current songs from the UK and US. 104.8FM\nDubai Eye - Western-oriented talk with focus on business, sport, lifestyle, and entertainment. Owned by Arabian Radio Network. 103.8FM\nDubai 92 - Mainly 1990s music. Popular with British ex-pats. Owned by Arabian Radio Network. 92.0FM\nVirgin Radio 104.4 - Chart music. Operates under franchise from Virgin Radio International. Owned by Arabian Radio Network.\nCity 101.6 - Broadcasts Indian music.\nAbu Dhabi Classic FM - Despite its name, this station broadcasts classical and jazz music across the UAE. In Dubai it is on 87.9FM.\nTalk 100.3 - Tune in to Talk 100.3, Dubai's best radio station, and experience the best of news, sports, and conversation from around the world.\nLUV 107.1 - LUV 107.1 plays a mix of music from the 90's through today.\nInternational newspapers are also available in most hotels and airport terminals. Carrefour and Borders bookstores sell British and American newspapers. Todaily, a local printing house, can furnish newspapers and periodicals from around the world daily.\n\n\n== Cope ==\nThe weekly day is traditionally Friday, as it is considered the end of the week and a blessed day in Islam. However, since 2022, the public sector has Friday as a half working day, ending at noon, and the weekend extends through Sunday.\n\n\n=== Religious services ===\nDubai gives freedom of religion to its residents and citizens.\n\nSt Mary's Catholic Church is a Roman Catholic church located in Oud Metha opposite the Indian High School. Masses are celebrated in Tagalog (Filipino), some Indian dialects as well as in Arabic and English.  There is also a Catholic school near it.\nHoly Trinity Church, a Protestant church, is also in Oud Metha.\n\n\n=== Consulates ===\nMany countries have established full service consulates (Consulates General) in Dubai to provide consular services for their nationals living in the UAE or certain areas like Dubai and the northern Emirates, as well as visa services for others seeking to visit their respective countries. Most of the consulates are located in/around Al Karama and Um Hurair (consulate district) in the Burr Dubai District, south of Dubai Creek. They can also be located in other parts of town too. If corresponding by mail/post use their PO box address as mail is only delivered to a PO Box with no post codes. If delivering to a street address with DHL, FedEx, UPS or another private courier be sure to include a recipient phone number so that the delivery driver can call for directions or clarification on the address. Some countries may have no consulate in Dubai but rather handle everything from their embassy in Abu Dhabi, while others may assign their consular duties solely to the Dubai consulate. Check their website links or call before going to or sending any correspondence:\n\n  Australia, Level 25, Bur Juman Business Tower, Khalifa Bin Zayed Road; PO Box 124400, \u260f +971 4-508 7100, fax: +971 4-355 1547, info@austrade.gov.au. \n  Bangladesh, Villa No. 36 & 145 Abdulla Hussain Al Malik Villa 123/3 Street, Abu Hail Road Al Wuheida, Deira; PO Box 4366, \u260f +971 4 238-8199, +971 4 265-1116.

        "title": "Istanbul",
        "extract": "Istanbul (Turkish: \u0130stanbul) is a very large city of fantastic history, culture and beauty. Called Byzantium in ancient times, the city's name was changed to Constantinople in 324 CE when it was rebuilt by the first Christian Roman Emperor, Constantine. The name \"Istanbul\", perhaps surprisingly, comes from Greek and could be translated as a corruption of \"to the city\". While the term had been in widespread use for centuries, it only became the official name of the city upon the foundation of the Republic of Turkey in the 1920s.\nThe most populous city in Europe, Istanbul forms the financial and cultural center of Turkey and confidently straddles the borders between Asia and Europe as it has for millennia: this is the result when you mix ancient Christendom, a medieval metropolis and the modern Middle East. Situated on either side of the Bosphorus, Istanbul retains its metropolitan status: the city's population is more than 14 million people, making it one of the largest cities in the world.\nLauded in antiquity as \"the second Rome\", this is a city where you most certainly should roam \u2014 culture and excitement lie around every corner and more than 2,000 years of history await you.\n\n\n== Districts ==\n\n\n== Understand ==\n\n\n=== History ===\n\nWhile relics of prehistoric human settlement were found in the Yar\u0131mburgaz Cave near the K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck\u00e7ekmece Lake and during the construction of a subway station in Yenikap\u0131, Greek colonists from Megara, directed by their legendary leader Byzas, have been traditionally accepted as the founders of Istanbul. Expanding the ancient Greek colony of Byzantium by the order of the Roman Emperor Constantine the Great, the imperial city of Constantinople was for nearly a thousand years the heavily-fortified capital of the Eastern Roman (later termed Byzantine) Empire. To this day, the Ecumenical Patriarch, head of the Eastern Orthodox Church continues to be the Archbishop of Constantinople, who is still based in Istanbul. It was finally conquered by the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II on 29 May 1453, an event sometimes used to mark the end of the Middle Ages. It was the nerve centre for military campaigns that were to enlarge the Ottoman Empire dramatically. By the mid-1500s, Istanbul, with a population of almost half a million, was a major cultural, political, and commercial centre. Ottoman rule continued until it was defeated in the first World War and Istanbul was occupied by the allies. When the Republic of Turkey was born in 1923 after the War of Independence, Kemal Atat\u00fcrk moved its capital to the city of Ankara, strategically located in the centre of the new republic. However, Istanbul has continued to expand dramatically; today its population is approximately 14 million and increases at an estimated 400,000 immigrants per year. Industry has expanded even as tourism has grown. It continues to be a city that creates its own history at the intersection where both continents meet.\n\n\n=== Orientation ===\nIstanbul is divided in three by the north-south Bosphorus Strait (\u0130stanbul Bo\u011faz\u0131, \"the strait of Istanbul\"), the dividing line between Europe and Asia, the estuary of the Golden Horn (Hali\u00e7) bisecting the western part and the Sea of Marmara (Marmara Denizi) forming a boundary to the south. Most sights are concentrated in the old city on the peninsula of Sultanahmet, to the west of the Bosphorus between the Horn and the Sea. Across the Horn to the north are Galata, Beyo\u011flu and Taksim, the heart of modern Istanbul, while Kad\u0131k\u00f6y is the major district on the comparatively less-visited Anatolian side of the city. The Black Sea forms the relatively less developed northern boundary of Istanbul.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nDespite what its stereotypes, artificially placed palm trees, or misleading tourism brochures may imply, Istanbul is not the sunny, warm year-round holiday destination some people might hope it is. In fact, Istanbul has way more in common with Southwestern France or the Pacific Northwest than with virtually all of the cities near the Mediterranean Sea, with an average temperature around 12-14\u00b0C, it is only 1\u00b0C warmer than New York, and around the same average temperature as Portland, Oregon or Bordeaux, France.\nSimply put, Istanbul has an oceanic climate with some Mediterranean influences. This means very warm, mostly sunny summers, and cool to chilly, bleak winters with very frequent rain and, on occasion, snow.\nIstanbul is a fairly cloudy city, especially for the Eastern Mediterranean, with around 1,700-2,300 hours of sunshine, which means the skies are overcast around half of the time. Overcast conditions can occur because of dense fog, which is common year-round, affecting certain inland parts of Istanbul for an impressive 200 days per year. However, because of the urbanization of Istanbul and the resulting 'urban heat island', fog has become increasingly rare in the densely inhabited coastal regions of Istanbul, making summers much sunnier than they once were.\nAnother potentially surprising part of Istanbul's climate is its frequent rainfall, as even though rainfall varies a lot depending on where you are in the city, the city average is somewhere around 800mm over some 150 days of the year. This makes umbrellas useful, especially in summer and fall when rains tend to be heavier. Istanbul is wetter than most major European cities, such as London, Paris, or Berlin. However, a large part of Istanbul's rainfall happens in the colder months, leaving the warmest months to sunny, moderately dry weather.\nBefore getting into more detailed information, it's important to understand that because of its huge size, topography, and maritime influences, Istanbul exhibits a multitude of distinct microclimates. Thus, different sections of Istanbul can experience different weather conditions at the same time. A good example of this would be the occasional summer showers in the city. These showers often affect the north of the city much more than the south, and the south would likely stay dry while the north gets soaked.\n\n\n==== Summer ====\n\nSummer (Jul-Aug) is generally quite warm, averaging around 26\u00b0C during the day and 17\u00b0C at night. The weather is often pleasant, and there is an almost constant northeasterly wind called Poyraz that prevents the city from experiencing temperatures higher than 32-33\u00b0C on most years. However, the same breezy conditions, also bring very humid air from the Black Sea, causing very muggy conditions, which raises the perceived temperature quite a bit.\nSummer is relatively dry, but generally not rainless, with around four to five rainy days a month. The rain that does fall during this time can get heavy however, and for a number of reasons Istanbul is known to be a severe weather hotspot, with, among other things, around 2-3 hailstorms per year, which is extremely high for a Mediterranean-influenced city.\nLight clothing is recommended during summer. A light jacket and/or light sweater if the summer evenings do become a little cooler than average could be useful.\n\n\n==== Spring and Autumn ====\nSpring (Apr-Jun) and fall (Sep-Nov) are both mild, with a good mix of rain and shine. Late spring (late May to early June) and early autumn (late September to early October) are quite pleasant and the best times to visit the city. During these periods temperatures are pleasantly warm, and the weather is less rainy than in winter; even though the nights can get a little chilly, and rain can definitely not be ruled out.\n\n\n==== Winter ====\n\nWinter (Dec-Mar) is generally chilly, averaging around 8\u00b0C during the day and 2\u00b0C at night, but the high relative humidity levels make the winter air quite a bit more miserable, and the wind chill can make the temperatures feel much colder. There can be mild and cold periods as well, these usually changing with the wind patterns. A southwesterly wind, called Lodos, can bring relatively comfortable but showery days with highs around 12-16\u00b0C, while northerly winds bring daytime temperatures at or slightly above freezing.\nThis time of year is infamous for its rain. Rain generally falls as a light, intermittent and barely noticeable kind of drizzle, but it can go on for a week or more at a time, with almost three weeks of rain on average per month. This kind of rain can easily be managed without an umbrella (and indeed, most locals tend to prefer raincoats or warm clothing instead), however if you do want an umbrella when it's raining out, the streets of Istanbul are suddenly filled with umbrella sellers as soon as it starts raining. Although the umbrellas they provide are a little shoddy, and you can find much better umbrellas for that price at shops if you look around a bit.\nSnowfall is somewhat common between December and March, however this changes quite a bit from year to year. Mild winters can get only a trace of accumulation, while colder winters can bring up to three weeks of snow cover. One other thing to note here is how heavy the snow can get in Istanbul. This is because Istanbul's snowfall comes from an event called sea or lake effect snowfall, where bands of heavy snow showers lash the coasts of Istanbul, bringing waves of showery snow. These events generally don't go on for long, as when the colder weather leaves Istanbul, so does the snow. However, accumulations of up to 75 cm in a single day have been recorded, even in the warmer city center.\nWarm clothing is essential during winter even if temperature extremes aren't common, wind chill can make most people feel absolutely miserable otherwise.\n\n\n== Get in ==\nSee Turkey#Get in for visa requirements. From 2020, most EU, UK, CIS and South American visitors do not need a visa. Those from many other countries including Australia, Canada and US can get an e-visa online, valid for 90 days.\n\n\n=== By plane ===\n\n1 Istanbul Airport (IST IATA). Istanbul's chief airport, and the main port of entry into Turkey, is 30 km northwest of the city in Arnavutk\u00f6y, on the Europe-side Black Sea coast. It was opened in 2018 / 19 and replaced Atat\u00fcrk Airport. It has a very wide range of international flights, by Turkish Airlines and other carriers, and domestic flights at least daily to all the major Turkish cities. There's car hire and the usual passenger facilities. Metro line M11, public buses, and taxis are available to the city centre. A second metro line is under construction from the airport to the western district of Halkal\u0131.   (updated Feb 2023)\nGetting to and from Istanbul International Airport\n\nBy metro \u2013 The M11 metro line connects the airport to the city, providing a fast and affordable option. The metro station is outside airport exit 11, in front of the parking lot, where you can purchase an 'Istanbulkart.' To reach your destination, you will likely need to transfer and possibly walk a short distance. The Istanbul metro operates from 06:15 to 00:15.\nBy bus \u2013 Two companies, Havaist and IETT, provide transport to and from Istanbul International Airport, though neither offers a direct connection to the popular Sultanahmet area. You can reach other parts of the city using IETT independently or in combination with other transportation modes. Havaist's luxury buses (iSt-1) take you to major transit hubs like Aksaray Metro Station (the trip takes about 90 minutes depending on traffic). Havaist operates non-stop every 25-30 minutes, and a ticket costs \u20ac5.42 or $5.99 (October, 2024). The bus station is located on Level -2 at the airport. Here, you can purchase an 'Istanbulkart,' which is valid for all forms of public transport, including public restrooms. Airport shuttle tickets can also be bought online via the Havaist app or website, where you can also find the list of stations and timetable. If you choose city buses or trams, note that travel can be challenging if you have luggage or arrive during peak hours. The vehicles may be crowded, and transfers between lines often involve a bit of walking.\nBy taxi \u2013 Taking a taxi offers a comfortable transfer, but it may not be fast due to Istanbul's heavy traffic. A ride to Sultanahmet typically costs approximately \u20ac27.92 (according to airport guide as of October 2024), depending on the time of travel since taxis do not have fixed rates. Fares are the same day and night, and tipping is optional. The ride of about 50 km takes around 50 minutes. Official taxi stands are located outside each level of the airport. Yellow (orange) taxis are the most affordable, but you can also opt for a more comfortable blue taxi (15% more expensive) or a black luxury taxi (70% more expensive). Avoid using unofficial vehicles, and be aware of common taxi scams. Taxis can be booked online, using standard services, or through mobile apps (Uber, Bolt).\n\n2 Sabiha G\u00f6k\u00e7en International Airport (SAW  IATA). Istanbul's Asia-side airport is 30 km east of city centre. It has many domestic flights, often by Anadolu Jet the budget offshoot of Turkish Airlines. Pegasus and other carriers have flights across Europe, the Middle East, North Africa and Western Asia, especially in summer when this is a low cost route to the Turkish beach resorts and Northern Cyprus. None of the airlines that use Sabiha G\u00f6k\u00e7en have announced plans to relocate to the new Istanbul Airport: it's big enough to take them, but not convenient for Istanbul's Asia side. There's only one terminal, with a full range of passenger facilities, but ground-side procedures here are laborious and arriving two hours before your flight is cutting it very close. There's a security check just to enter the terminal (they will inspect but not confiscate liquids), then the usual check after bag-drop to get air-side. The ground-side departure hall is comfortable. If you have a long stopover here, the LGM CIP Lounge is a good deal, with unlimited free beer, wine, soft drinks, light meals and snacks for \u20ac12 entry per person. (Some connection times are very long, as the outbound flight tries to scoop arrivals from far and wide.) There is a hotel at the airport, some half-a-dozen at Kurtk\u00f6y 2 km north, then another dozen at Pendik town (on the Marmara coast near the YHT station) 6 km south.   (updated Feb 2023)\nGetting to and from SAW:\n\nBy metro \u2013 Line M4 runs from the airport to Kad\u0131k\u00f6y, taking about an hour. The line is not well-connected to the rest of the metro network, but you can continue to the European side by ferry or transfer to the Marmaray train at Ayr\u0131l\u0131k \u00c7e\u015fmesi.\nBy train \u2013 Sabiha G\u00f6k\u00e7en Airport is 12 km from Pendik YHT railway station, take a taxi or bus 132H to catch fast trains east to Ankara and Konya.\nBy bus:\nHavaist \u2013 It works on both airports. A prepaid solution is available via mobile application.\nHavab\u00fcs \u2013 It runs from the airport to Taksim in the city centre (50 km, 60-90 min), Yenisahra an Asia-side transport hub (50 min) and Kad\u0131k\u00f6y the ferry quay for Emin\u00f6n\u00fc in Sultanahmet Old City (60 min). Buses run every 30 min between 04:00 and 01:00. Buy your ticket on the bus, Istanbulkart is valid.\nCity bus (\u0130ETT bus) \u2013 They are the cheapest, with the main routes:\nto Kad\u0131k\u00f6y by bus E-10 (via Kurtk\u00f6y, runs 24 hours) or E-11, taking 60-90 min, more in heavy traffic. You need a two-zone ticket.\nto Taksim and elsewhere on the European side, take bus E-3 to 4. Levent metro station. It runs 24 hours, takes 2 hours and needs a three-zone ticket.\nOther routes include E-9 to Bostanci, 16S to Metrobus Uzun\u00e7ayir, KM-20 to Pendi\u0307k & Kartal Metro, KM22 to Cevi\u0307zli\u0307 Platforms, E-18 to Altuni\u0307zade & \u00dcmrani\u0307ye, and 122H via Yeni\u0307\u015fehi\u0307r to 4.Levent Metro.\nBy shuttle \u2013 Inquire with your accommodation or find online.\nBy taxi \u2013 To Taksim should cost around \u20ac20 (as of May 2022).\nOther arrival airports are only worth considering for the far northwest of the country and never for Istanbul itself. For instance for Edirne you might consider Sofia or Plovdiv then the intercity bus. But it's almost certainly quicker, cheaper and less hassle to fly into IST then take the bus or train west.\nAtat\u00fcrk Airport closed in 2019. Beware (!) of out-of-date road signage and maps, and crooked taxi drivers who will take you to a demolition site. Driving out from the city, you should be heading noticeably north, maybe on D020, or O-3 to turn north on O-7. If you're keeping south on D100, the old place is where he intends to take you.\n\n\n=== By train ===\n\nWikivoyage has an article on Rail travel in Turkey\nSince the heyday of the legendary Orient Express, travelling by train has been the classic way of reaching Istanbul. It's still an interesting journey, but the trains no longer reach their classic termini. Those from Europe terminate at Halkal\u0131 west of the city, where you change to the frequent cross-city Marmaray train to reach the centre. Those from the east terminate at S\u00f6\u011f\u00fctl\u00fc\u00e7e\u015fme in Kad\u0131k\u00f6y on the Asian side.\nThis means that Istanbul has two large terminus stations that don't have any mainline trains. 3 Sirkeci on the European side is on the Marmaray network, with cross-city and Metro trains deep underground but nothing at street-level. 4 Haydarpa\u015fa in Asia has no trains at all. Both stations are worth a quick visit as monuments to a bygone age of rail travel. And both of them have ticket offices, though it's usually simpler to buy online from the website of Turkish Republic State Railways, TCDD.\nTurkish railway officials have repeatedly said that both Sirkeci and Haydarpa\u015fa termini will be used once again, at least for some services. But as of 2024 no concrete plans have yet materialized and given the usual scale of delays to rail projects in Turkey it might be a while until trains return to these grand old stations.\n\n\n==== Trains from the east ====\nYHT high speed trains (y\u00fcksek h\u0131zl\u0131 tren) run to 5 S\u00f6\u011f\u00fctl\u00fc\u00e7e\u015fme  on the  Asian side, close to their future Haydarpa\u015fa terminus. Two trains a day continue under the Bosphorus calling at Bak\u0131rk\u00f6y in the western suburbs and terminating at Halkal\u0131. They don't stop anywhere in the Sultanahmet or Old City area, and they don't connect with the Europe trains; change to the frequent Marmaray trains for both purposes.\nThere are frequent YHT services from Eski\u015fehir (3 hours) and Ankara (4\u00bd hours), and three per day from Konya (4\u00bd hours). One per day runs from Karaman via Konya. Two run from Sivas via Ankara. YHT services are affordable and very popular, so book a few days ahead to guarantee a seat even though the price remains the same no matter when you book. Change in Konya for Adana and in Ankara for Erzurum, Kars and Tatvan (which has connections to Tabriz and Tehran in Iran). \nOn the eastern edge of the city, YHT trains also call at Bostanci, Pendik and Gebze. 6 Pendik, 25 km east of city centre, is a convenient stop for transfers from Istanbul Sabiha G\u00f6k\u00e7en airport (10 km, taxi or bus). Consider this route if you intend to fly into Istanbul and immediately head east. Pendik itself is a small township with hotels and cafes, with the bus station and taxi ranks north side of the YHT station.\nThe Ankara Express is an overnight passenger service between Istanbul and Ankara. It leaves Istanbul Halkal\u0131 nightly at 22:00, picking up at S\u00f6\u011f\u00fctl\u00fc\u00e7e\u015fme, Bostanci and Pendik plus nine other intermediate stations, reaching Ankara before 07:00. The return service has the same times, taking about nine hours, and there are seats and sleepers plus a dining car.\n\n\n==== Trains from Europe and European Turkey ====\n\nA sleeper train departs Sofia around 18:30 nightly, running via Plovdiv, Kapikule on the border, and Edirne, to terminate at Halkal\u0131 by 10:00. From June to Sept the Bosphor Express (with couchettes but no sleeper berths) departs Bucharest at 10:10, running via Ruse to Kapikule. Here it's coupled to the train from Sofia, and all passengers have to get out for border procedures, before continuing to Halkal\u0131. The westbound service leaves Halkal\u0131 at 20:00 to reach Sofia by 09:40 and Bucharest at 17:30 next day. From Oct to May the through-train from Bucharest doesn't run, so you change at Ruse then again at Kapikule, with a similar timetable. (Bear in mind that Romania and Bulgaria have daylight-saving time in summer but Turkey doesn't.) Trains from Budapest to Bucharest, and from Belgrade to Sofia, don't connect with the onward trains to Turkey, so you need an overnight stay.\nTCDD quote fares for these trains in euros. In 2025 a basic single from Sofia is \u20ac26. Add \u20ac10 for a couchette, \u20ac15 for a bed in a shared 2-person cabin or \u20ac35 for the entire cabin.\nThe Budapest-Belgrade line remains closed for engineering works. Belgrade-Sofia trains may be running but are not confirmed, you might have to take local trains and change at Ni\u0161 and Dimitrovgrad. Altogether it's better to reach Turkey via Bucharest. There's also a regional train once a day from Kapikule via Edirne to Halkal\u0131, and another from Uzunk\u00f6pr\u00fc.\nFor a luxurious stylish journey, once a year the Venice Simplon Orient Express runs from Paris to Istanbul. You travel in lovely restored 1930s luxury coaches and enjoy first-rate cuisine. Tickets start at \u20ac17,500; sorry, your Eurail pass won't help here.\nBetween Halkal\u0131 and downtown use the Marmaray cross-city suburban train, and allow an hour; trains run every 15 min (and see \"Get around\").\n\n7 Halkal\u0131 railway station (Halkal\u0131 gar\u0131), \u0130stasyon Cd., \u0130stasyon Mah., 34303 (25 km west of central Istanbul). The current terminus. This station has few facilities here, in particular, nowhere to change currency until you get downtown. Ticket machines for the Mamaray trains only accept Turkish cash except for a single one which now takes cards, though it will likely have a long queue when you arrive.   (updated Mar 2024)\n\n\n=== By bus ===\n\nTurkey has an extensive system of intercity buses for travel around the country, as well international routes. The majority of intercity buses servicing both European and Asian parts of Turkey depart and terminate at the Esenler Bus Station. Many of the bus companies have offices around the city and free courtesy mini-buses known as a \"servis,\" collect passengers from the city and take them to either the main bus stations or their own mini-terminals near the main motorways.\n\n\n==== European side ====\n\n\n===== Alibeyk\u00f6y =====\nThe 8 Alibeyk\u00f6y Terminal (Alibeyk\u00f6y Cep Otogar\u0131) is a secondary hub for the European side and is located at G\u00fczeltepe near the outer beltway of Istanbul. Despite its orderly and cool steel-and-glass look, and much smaller size compared with Esenler, this is an unexpectedly chaotic bus station.\nBuses from Anatolia stop here en route to Esenler bus station, 20\u201325 min further.\nThe T5 tram line connects this bus station to the M7 metro line, which can be used to get to Mecidiyek\u00f6y, a major hub for public transport and the business center of the city, the BRT Metrob\u00fcs line, and to Emin\u00f6n\u00fc all the while providing the passengers a scenic ride along the Golden Horn. There are also somewhat infrequent shuttle services available although none heads for Sultanahmet, they are slower than the tram, and don't expect their drivers to speak much English.\n\n\n===== Esenler =====\n\nOften called simply 'the Otogar' (Bus Station) or occasionally 'Bayrampa\u015fa Otogar', the colossal circular complex 9 Esenler Terminal (Esenler Otogar\u0131), is located at Esenler (although officially within the Bayrampa\u015fa district), about 10 km (6 miles) northwest of Sultanahmet. This is the city's main bus station (\u260f +90 212 658 0505) for intercity (including Gallipoli) and many international routes (such as Greece, Macedonia, Serbia, Romania and Bulgaria).\nWith 168 ticket offices and gates, shops, restaurants, hotel, police station, clinic and mosque, the B\u00fcy\u00fck Otogar (\"big bus station\") is a town in itself, but as it lacks a central information desk, you will have to research online on more generic websites like https://infobus.eu or ask around the individual offices for prices and timetables for your destination.\nIt is served by the Otogar metro station on the M1 metro line, that splits there into M1A and M1B. Connections to major destinations within the city are as follows:\n\nSultanahment: From the Otogar metro station you can take the metro to Aksaray or Zeytinburnu and then easily connect with a tram to Sultanahmet (about 30 minutes via Aksaray) or Kabata\u015f/Taksim. If you travelling with a lot of luggage you may prefer to transfer between the tram to the Metro at Zeytinburnu as the stations are side by side, whereas at Yusufpa\u015fa it is necessary to carry your luggage up and down the steps of an underpass to get to Aksaray Metro station. Going via Zeytinburnu will take longer. The journey will be cheaper if you purchase and recharge an \u0130stanbulkart from the machines at the entrance to the metro station.\nBeyo\u011flu: Take the M1 Metro line to Yenikap\u0131, then change there for the M2 Metro line in the direction of Hac\u0131osman, and get out at Sishane or Taksim. An alternative is to take IETT bus 830 which departs from the bus station at 06:00. 07:00, 07:35, 09:00, 11:00, 13:15, 15:55, 17:15 and 18:35 M to Sa, and at 11:00, 13:00, 15:00 and 17:15 on Sundays. It takes approximately 60 minutes to reach Taksim Square. You'll need a Jeton or \u0130stanbulkart to pay for your fare.\nBus connections: The main lines from the centre include 28O from Be\u015fikta\u015f, 75O from Mecidiyek\u00f6y, 91O from Emin\u00f6n\u00fc, and 83O from Taksim. Refer to the IETT website for timetables. Esenler is approximately 39 km from the new Istanbul airport. They are connected by the HVIST-5 airport bus service operated by Hava\u0130st. The journey takes 60 to 75 minutes.\nCourtesy mini-buses: Some bus companies such as Pamukkale operate servis between the bus station and various pickup and drop-off points around the city.\nNote that despite having been renamed the 15 Temmuz Demokrasi Otogar (also called the 15 Temmuz \u015eehitler Otogar) in memory of those who died during the abortive coup attempt of 15 July 2016, most bus companies continue to use the Esenler Otogar name only.\n\n\n==== Asian side ====\nBuses travelling to and between Istanbul's Esenler bus station and Anatolian destinations stop on the Asian side of Istanbul to pick up and drop off passengers.\nIf you are travelling between the European side of Istanbul and Anatolia it's worth considering getting on or off the bus on the Asian side as it takes anything between 1h 15min and 1h 45min hours off the total travel time.\nFor many years the principal bus station on the Asian side of Istanbul has been at 10 Harem (pronounced hah-REHM; not to be confused with the ladies' quarter of the Topkap\u0131 Palace with the same name) right on the Bosphorus, south of \u00dcsk\u00fcdar and north of Haydarpa\u015fa.\nFrom Harem, regular car ferries (which take walk-on passengers) cross the Bosphorus to Sirkeci (just east of Emin\u00f6n\u00fc) on the European side (every 30 minutes M-Sa 05:30-23:00 Su 07:00-22:00). There are also regular passenger ferries from Kad\u0131k\u00f6y and \u00dcsk\u00fcdar south and north of Harem to Be\u015fikta\u015f and Kabata\u015f on the European side. Dolmu\u015fes and many bus lines make the quick run to \u00dcsk\u00fcdar, from where you can also connect to the M5 metro line, and Marmaray cross-city suburban train.\nMany of the bus companies (especially the larger ones offering a long list of destinations) have relocated to 11 Dudullu Terminals as these locations provide a more convenient access to the major motorways. While some of these hubs are relatively close to various stations of M5, none are directly on that metro line, so better catch the servis minibuses into various central areas, including Harem, Kad\u0131k\u00f6y and \u00dcsk\u00fcdar.\nReserve a seat in advance as some buses arrive on the Asian side from Esenler with no empty seats.\n\n\n=== By boat ===\n\nSee also: Ferries in the Mediterranean\nThere are Black Sea ferries several times a week to Chornomorske, the main port for Odesa in Ukraine, taking 27 hours. They run all year and take vehicles; indeed trucking is an important part of their business, as so many travellers nowadays fly. The ferry terminal is at Haydarpa\u015fa, by the old railway station. These ferries used to sail to other Black Sea ports but they no longer do.\nAdditionally, reflecting Turkey's deepening diplomatic ties with Libya, a ferry sails between Istanbul and Misrata once per week.\nThere are no other international ferries to Istanbul - see \"Get around\" for local ferries around the Sea of Marmara. Cruise ships usually dock on the European side, to 12 Galataport, closer to the historic centre. These ships are on cruise itineraries, check with the operator whether a point-to-point journey ending in Istanbul is possible.\nThe piers of 13 Yenikap\u0131 and 14 Kad\u0131k\u00f6y host ferry lines to nearby cities such as Bursa an Yalova.\n\n\n=== By car ===\n\nIstanbul lies on the European highway E80, and relatively short distance north of E90, both stretching from Lisbon at the opposite end of the continent. As for the Asian highways, AH-1 from Tokyo, and AH-5 from Shanghai pass through the city before terminating at the Turkish-Bulgarian border in the west, but they are not signposted in Turkey.\nTraffic in Istanbul can be manic; expect a stressful drive because you will be cut off and honked at constantly. It seems that half of the cars in Istanbul are parking while the other half is stuck in traffic.\nEven if you are on a one-way road, always expect someone coming towards you. The city hosts more than 1\u00bd million cars and there is a strong demand for building of new or alternate highways which of course fill up with traffic as soon as they're built.\nIf you've arrived in Istanbul by car, and you're not familiar with the streets, it's better to park your car in a safe place and take public transportation to get around.\nThe parts of the city on either continent separated by the Bosphorus are connected by three bridges and a road tunnel. All require paying a toll to cross, and none accepts cash: payment must be made by using electronic stickers called HGS, obtainable from post offices.\nOn weekdays, there are potentially hour-long traffic jams on the highways leading to bridges, especially those two closer to the city centre, and particularly heading west in the mornings and east in the evenings, since most people live on the Anatolian side but work on the European side.\nThere is a great shortage of parking in Istanbul, and existing lots are quite expensive. You will see many cars parked on the sides of the road, in front of garage doors even.\nStreet signs are rare. It is a common thing to pull over and ask for directions, something the natives and taxi drivers do quite often.\n\n\n=== By bicycle ===\n\nThe Sultan's Trail (2,500 km) and the Sufi Trail (800 km) are cycling and hiking trails approaching the city from the west and the east, specifically Vienna and Konya respectively. The former retraces the campaign of Suleiman the Magnificent onto the Habsburg capital, while the latter follows an Ottoman Hajj pilgrimage route.\nOtherwise, you will have to approach the city on D-100 from either direction, or on the northern (and relatively less busy) route D-020 from the west, and perhaps switch to the bike paths along the Marmara coast once the suburban development begins, as all other main routes leading into the city are classified as motorways, and thus the bikes are forbidden on them.\n\n\n=== By thumb ===\nIstanbul is huge, so you'll need public transport between your accommodation and your pick-up/drop-off point. Leaving the city, the best routes are:\n\nWest into Europe: you want to be on main highway E-80. First take bus 448 from Yenibosna metro station (southern line, near Ataturk Airport) north towards Mimarsinan. Get off after about 5 km when you cross the E-80.\nEast into Asia: again, you want to reach highway E-80. Probably the closest you can start thumbing is Pendik: reach it by metro as described for the YHT railway station. Then start hitching on D-100 which will join E-80. A local lift as far as Gebze or Izmit will also be close to that highway.\n\n\n== Get around ==\n\n\u0130ETT (or just toplu ta\u015f\u0131ma) is the municipality's public transportation company. Istanbul's public transit system can be difficult to figure out. However, if you put some effort into it, you can avoid taxis and not walk too much.\nUnless you use the Istanbulkart, each time you use a tram, metro, bus, or boat on the public transport system, you will need to use a ticket or pass. They can be bought at various vending machines at bus, railway and metro stations or authorized ticket/Istanbulkart sellers (usually newspaper kiosks). Ticket fares across buses, trams and metros differ. Only cash in Turkish lira is accepted at ticket kiosks of public transport, no credit cards or foreign currency. The Istanbul subway system does not offer transfer tickets: each change to a new line requires a new fare.\nWhen travelling to Istanbul by air, it is much cheaper (and more fun) to use the bus (or metro system once it is extended) to get as close to your accommodation as possible before walking and/or taking a taxi to where you are staying. Although the public transport may be slightly confusing, taxis/charter buses from the airport are notoriously overpriced.\nIf public transport is your choice of getting around, consider using smartphone public transportation applications so that you can easily see stops, stations and terminals nearby or see alternate routes for your planned destination. \u0130ETT has an official one called Mobiett which is available for iOS, Android or Windows. But also Google Maps is very reliable to guide your way using public transport.\n\n\n=== \u0130stanbulkart ===\n\nThe \u0130stanbulkart is Istanbul's public transport smart card, which can be used as a ticket on buses, trams, suburban trains, metro, local ferries, etc. If you are in Istanbul for more than a day or two and intend to use public transport, it will pay for itself in a few trips. It can be purchased at a number of small corner shops throughout the city, or from the machines located at most stations, where it can also be recharged, using notes or a credit card.\nAn alternative to the physical card is the Mobile \u0130stanbulkart, which is an app you can load on your phone. However, as of 2024, signing up requires a Turkish mobile phone number, so unless you have one, you will be out of luck.\nYou touch the Istanbulkart to a reader when you get on the bus or enter the tram or metro platform. The great advantage for a group of travellers is that you can buy only one and touch it as many times as there are passengers (unlike London's Oyster card, there is no need to touch out, except the BRT Metrob\u00fcs line). You can buy or refill them at designated booths located at any major bus, tram, or metro station, as well as some other places such as newspaper stands close to bus stops. There are refill machines located at most metro or tram stops and ferry terminals. An Istanbulkart provides significantly discounted rates (a bit over half price for unlinked trips and even cheaper for transfers) compared to regular single tickets, as well as discounts on transfers and short round trips (when used multiple times within a limited period, roughly 1\u00bd hr since the last time you used it). The round trip to the airport pays for more than half the cost of this card. \nSome connections charge extra because their range is very large, e.g. the Marmaray train but even buses. However, there are refund machines at the exit of stations that serve these long distance connections. In case you only travel a short distance tap your card there, and you will be reimbursed some money. Either way, if you feel like you paid too much, tap or just always tap\u2014you won't get charged twice. As of 2023, however, Istanbulkart must be \"personalized\" - linked to a Turkish ID card - to be able to enjoy discount transfers and Marmaray refunds. This means that regular tourists are not eligible and will not enjoy any discounts on transfers and/or Marmaray refund. \nThe Istanbulkart is relatively new, and replaces the older Akbil metal touch-token which is deprecated. Though some Kiosks still have Akbil signs rather than Istanbulkart signs - but you can usually buy or top up your Istanbulkart at any kiosk where the Akbil sign is displayed. There is also the so-called \"mavi kart\" or blue card which is a cheaper option for frequent users of public transport but has some restrictions, can be used by one person whose photo and name are printed on it, it gives 180 trips in bus/tram/metro that have to be used up within a maximum period of 30 days.\n\n\n=== By train ===\nThe Marmaray cross-town train, opened in March 2019, links Halkali mainline station in the west with Bak\u0131rk\u00f6y, Zeytinburnu, Sirkeci and \u00dcsk\u00fcdar either side of the Bosphorus, and Bostanc\u0131, Kartal, Pendik and Gebze to the east; plus many small suburban stations. (Pendik and Gebze are on the YHT main line.) Trains run every 15 min 06:00-23:00 and between city centre and end of the line takes an hour. The central sections are shared with the metro.\nU3/T6 is an extension running along the Marmara coast of the Old City between Kazl\u0131\u00e7e\u015fme (transfer to the main Marmaray line, B1) and Sirkeci.\n\n\n=== By metro ===\nThe city Metro has many lines, although not all are equally useful to the visitor:\n\nLine M1A connects the main coach station (Otogar) to Aksaray, from where you can catch tram T1 to the city centre, and onward to train hub Yenikap\u0131 for connections to M2 and Marmaray.\nLine M1B is a branch of M1A which serves the western suburb of Kirazl\u0131. All trains serve the common section between Yenikap\u0131 and the bus station.\nLine M2 starts from Yenikap\u0131 and crosses the Golden Horn, continuing via \u015ei\u015fhane and Taksim Square to Mecidiyek\u00f6y and Levent in the business district, and further north to Hac\u0131osman (a major bus hub for suburbs on the north European side, eg Sar\u0131yer).\nLine M3 runs northwest from Bak\u0131rk\u00f6y, with transfer stations to Marmaray B1, M1A, M1B, M7 and M9.\nLine M4 on the Asian side goes from Kad\u0131k\u00f6y to the suburbs along the Marmara coast as far east to Kartal, Pendik (but 1 km away from Pendik YHT station), and Sabiha G\u00f6k\u00e7en Airport.\nLine M5 on the Asian Side runs from \u00dcsk\u00fcdar on the Bosphorus through \u00dcmraniye and \u00c7ekmek\u00f6y out to Samand\u0131ra in the east.\nLine M6 (also called Mini Metro) is a shuttle from the Levent station of M2, and serving the upscale district of Etiler and the main campus of Bo\u011fazi\u00e7i University in Hisar\u00fcst\u00fc. The funicular extension F4 connects to A\u015fiyan down on the Bosphorus.\nLine M7 mainly serves the densely populated residential areas in the north such as Ba\u011fc\u0131lar and Gaziosmanpa\u015fa (also known as G.O.P.), connecting them via Mecidiyek\u00f6y, the business district and one of the major transport hubs, to Y\u0131ld\u0131z, about a kilometre uphill from the ferry jetty at Be\u015fikta\u015f. This line also connects to the metro lines M3 and M2 as well as the metrob\u00fcs and the tram lines T4 and T5.\nLine M8 is a cross-city line on the Asian Side, connecting M4, M5, and Marmaray suburban (B1) lines with each other, and with the ferry jetty at Bostanc\u0131.\nLine M9 is a western extension branching off M3.\nLine M11 takes you as far as to the main airport from Gayrettepe on M2 and Ka\u011f\u0131thane on M7.\nMuch of the city is not yet served by the metro, and the distance between stations is larger than in most European cities. But the metro is fast where it does go and meticulously clean and modern, with much of it dating to the 21st century. Most lines are deep underground and some have entrances amidst busy streets with pedestrian tunnels or bridges the only access, so be prepared to walk quite a bit when going to and from stations. Transfers virtually always require exiting and re-entering the system which means a new full fare (with single use tickets) or a reduced fare for the connection (with Istanbulkart). You do not have to swipe any card on exit for metro or tram routes but you do have to do so for Istanbulkart on Metrobus, else you'll be charged the maximum distance fare. As of 2023, only \"personalized\" Istanbulkarts will receive any refunds or discounts.\nIstanbul's first underground system dates to the 19th century, when the funicular subway \"T\u00fcnel\" (F2) was constructed to operate from Karak\u00f6y to Istiklal Caddesi in 1875, travelling 573 m up a steep hill. It's still running and is handy for going from the Galata Bridge to \u0130stiklal Caddesi, the famous throughfare of Beyo\u011flu\nThere is also another, modern funicular system (F1) connecting Taksim to Kabata\u015f where you can transfer to ferries for the Anatolian side, or to trams bound for the old city.\nHeavy construction on extensions and new lines continues apace, with the gap between the M1 and the M2 plugged with Yenikap\u0131 station. You can connect M4 and M5 via Marmaray from Yenikap\u0131 station. Unfortunately most network maps already show the yet to be built extensions in a lighter shade which can be confusing for a casual glance and frustrating when contemplating where you might be able to go if only you visited Istanbul a year or two later.\nThe old plastic tokens are no longer valid: the only way to pay for metro is Istanbulkart or limited-pass cards. The metro stations do not have a staffed ticket booth, so you must obtain your tickets or top-up your Istanbulkart through ticket machines. To buy limited pass cards, insert coins or notes and then press the button marked onay/okay. Though an Istanbulkart (see above) may be more cost effective during your trip.\n\n\n=== By tram ===\n\nSnaking its way between its eastern terminus Kabata\u015f on the Bosphorus and the western terminus at Ba\u011fc\u0131lar in the northwest, T1 is the most useful tram line, serving many popular sites across the Old City and ferry jetties. The most helpful interchange stations are Kabata\u015f (for F1 funicular to Taksim), Karak\u00f6y (for F2 old funicular, T\u00fcnel, to the lower end of \u0130stiklal Avenue and ferries to the Asian Side), Emin\u00f6n\u00fc (for T5 tram and ferries to the Asian Side), Laleli-\u00dcniversite (for M2 metro), Aksaray (for B1 Marmaray), Yusufpa\u015fa (for M1 metro), Topkap\u0131 (for T4 light rail), Cevizliba\u011f (for BRT Metrob\u00fcs), Zeytinburnu (for M1 and BRT), and Ba\u011fc\u0131lar (for M1 and M3 metro).\nDuring rush hours (roughly 07:00-09:00 and 17:00-19:30), every other tram runs only the central section between Emin\u00f6n\u00fc or Sultanahmet and Cevizliba\u011f. Speaking of which, during rush hours, it's best to skip the tram entirely, as walking instead is not only less endeavouring than trying to stand in the most nightmarish sardine can, but also is quicker as the crowd won't disperse enough to allow you to get into the car before the second or even the third tram calling at.\nOther tram lines are T5 from Emin\u00f6n\u00fc via Fener and Balat along the Golden Horn to Ey\u00fcp and Alibeyk\u00f6y (the secondary bus station and interchange to M7 metro), and T4 (part underground; more like metro-tram light rail of some European cities) from Topkap\u0131 outside the city walls to the nondescript northwestern suburbs.\nThe vintage tram lines T2, 1920s tram cars rattling along \u0130stiklal Avenue, and T3, 1960s German-made streetcars on a circular route between Kad\u0131k\u00f6y and nearby Moda on the Asian Side, are more of attractions than practical transport options.\nAs with other public transport, you use Istanbulkart for the payment, but you must pay another fare each time you change lines although on a progressively discounted rate.\nTram lines are run by Metro Istanbul.\n\n\n=== By boat ===\n\nUnique Istanbul liners (large conventional ferry boats), sea-buses (high speed catamarans), or mid-sized private ferries travel between the European and Asian sides of the city. The crossing takes about 20 minutes, and gives great views of the Bosphorus. Sometimes the ferry when arriving at a dock can bounce off the pier accidentally, even on calm days. This can cause people to fall over if they are standing up, so it is advisable to remain seated until the ferry has come to an absolute stop.\nIn Istanbul, liners from any given pier generally take only a certain route, and these piers are signposted as according to the destination. For instance, Emin\u00f6n\u00fc alone has more than 5 piers (including the ones used by ferries other than liners), so if you should head for, say, \u00dcsk\u00fcdar, you should take the ferry which departs from \u00dcsk\u00fcdar \u0130skelesi. Replace '\u00dcsk\u00fcdar' with the destination of your choice.\nIstanbul liners travel on the following routes:\n\nKarak\u00f6y\u2013Haydarpa\u015fa\u2013Kad\u0131k\u00f6y\nKad\u0131k\u00f6y\u2013Emin\u00f6n\u00fc\n\u00dcsk\u00fcdar\u2013Emin\u00f6n\u00fc\n\u00dcsk\u00fcdar\u2013Karak\u00f6y\u2013Emin\u00f6n\u00fc\u2013Ey\u00fcpsultan (The Golden Horn Route)\nKad\u0131k\u00f6y\u2013Besikta\u015f\nKabatas\u2013Uskudar\u2013Harem\nIstinye\u2013Emirgan\u2013Kanl\u0131ca\u2013Anadolu Hisar\u0131\u2013Kandilli\u2013Bebek\u2013Arnavutk\u00f6y\u2013\u00c7engelk\u00f6y (The Whole Bosphorus Route)\nAnadolu Kava\u011f\u0131\u2013Rumeli Kava\u011f\u0131\u2013Sariyer\nEmin\u00f6n\u00fc\u2013Kavaklar (Special Bosphorus Tour, Recommended For Tourists)\nSirkeci\u2013Adalar\u2013Yalova\u2013C\u0131narc\u0131k (The Princes' Islands Route)\n\nFurthermore, the sea-buses (deniz otob\u00fcs\u00fc) follow the same (or more) routes, usually much faster than liners. Returning to Yenikap\u0131 from Kad\u0131k\u00f6y by sea-bus is a fast and convenient way to cross the Bosphorus; at Yenikap\u0131 you can change to numerous urban rail routes.\nFour main private ferry routes for travelling between Asia and Europe sides are:\n\nBesikta\u015f\u2013\u00dcsk\u00fcdar\nKabata\u015f\u2013\u00dcsk\u00fcdar (close to tram and funicular system in Kabata\u015f)\nEmin\u00f6n\u00fc\u2013\u00dcsk\u00fcdar (close to tram in Emin\u00f6n\u00fc)\nEmin\u00f6n\u00fc\u2013Kad\u0131k\u00f6y (close to tram in Emin\u00f6n\u00fc)\nThere is also a Golden Horn boat line, starting from Ey\u00fcpsultan and ending in the Asian Side, \u00dcsk\u00fcdar, passing through notable touristic places like Balat, Fener, Cibali and Karak\u00f6y. Although the trip takes around an hour to complete, the boat ride is quite enjoyable with beautiful scenery of the Golden Horn. The boats arrive in the stations only once every hour though, if you plan on taking this boat you should time it well. \nAll of the ferries, including private ones, can be paid for using the AKBIL/Istanbulkart system.\nVery useful are the fast ferryboats (travelling at 55 km/h) running from several points, such as the Yenikapi\u2013Yalova one, that allows you (with a connecting bus in Yalova) to be in Bursa centre in less than three hours. Prices are marginally higher and the gain in time is considerable, though the view is not as nice. There are also cheaper BUDO ferry lines from Emin\u00f6n\u00fc to Mudanya, the port for Bursa. From there you can take a bus to the Bursa city centre.\n\n\n=== By bus ===\n\nPublic transportation buses are either run or inspected by \u0130ETT. Public buses in Istanbul come in many colours and shapes, but the most important thing to keep in mind is that ticket sales on board have completely been phased out, so you will have to obtain one (or an \u0130stanbulkart, which is accepted on all public transport methods) prior to boarding the bus.\nIstanbul's heavily used bus rapid transit (BRT) system, locally called Metrob\u00fcs, is served by long hybrid buses running on their special lanes along the city's inner beltway, separated from all other traffic and thus saving lots of time in Istanbul's generally congested roads. While an extremely important transport option for the locals, the system covers areas not usually visited by the travellers, between Beylikd\u00fcz\u00fc in the far western suburbs of the city and Kad\u0131k\u00f6y on the Asian Side via Bak\u0131rk\u00f6y, Cevizliba\u011f outside the old city walls near the Topkap\u0131 Gate, the business district in Mecidiyek\u00f6y, and the Bosphorus Bridge.\nMost bus lines operate roughly 06:00-23:59, usually with a reduced volume of services after 22:00. Some lines between major centres operate 24/7 though, as is the Metrob\u00fcs, with about an hour intervals. After midnight, buses cost two tickets per person rather than the usual one.\nNight Time Bus Lines:\n\nA double-check from \u0130ETT website is strongly recommended.\nTH-1 Taksim - Atat\u00fcrk Airport (does not operate between 01:00 - 04:00)\n40 Taksim Square\u2013Rumelifeneri/Garip\u00e7e\nE10 Kadikoy\u2013Sabiha Gokcen International Airport\n15F Kadikoy\u2013Beykoz\n130 Kadikoy\u2013Tuzla\n34A Sogutlucesme(Kadikoy)\u2013Edirnekapi (Metrobus)\n34 Avcilar\u2013Zincirlikuyu (Metrobus)\nAs a tourist, you are most likely to use the tram and the metro in the Sultanahmet and Taksim area since there are no bus lines operating in the area anymore.\nBuses and streetcars tend to be very crowded during rush hours, especially on Mondays and Fridays. That can also create opportunities for pickpockets.\n\n\n=== By taxi ===\n\nTaxis are an easy way to get around. Check the start, minimum and per km rates online. and  Tipping is generally unnecessary. Sometimes, drivers will not start the meter and try to negotiate a fixed price. You should avoid these cabs and take another one as you will almost certainly end up paying too much. In general, asking \"how much to go to ...?\" before getting in is a sure-fire way to mark yourself out as an easily-swindled tourist. Rather, make sure they put the taximeter on.  If you don't see a taximeter ticking away, ask them to turn it on. Drivers do normally work with the taximeter, so they should not be surprised when you ask them to put it on. There is no extra fare at night.\nIf you have an internet connection on your laptop or mobile device, you can use Istanbul Taxi Fare Calculator just before taking a taxi from airport, hotel or restaurant. It will help you to easily estimate taxi fares based on pick-up and drop-off locations anywhere in Istanbul, give an outline of the journey and avoid potential taxi scams.\nThe major ride-hailing companies are Mart\u0131, Uber and Bitaksi. Uber operates as a licensed-taxi dispatcher in Turkey, as (non-taxi) ride-hailing apps have not received regulatory approval.\nTraffic can be very bad, it can take an hour for a few kilometers through the old city. You might be better off taking the metro out of the old city and then a taxi from there.  In the summer months especially the shore road can have very congested on the  Dolmabah\u00e7e - Be\u015fikta\u015f - Ortak\u00f6y - Kuru\u00e7e\u015fme stretch, in both directions.\n\n\n=== By shared taxi (Dolmu\u015f) ===\nDolmu\u015f (Turkish: \"full\") is a shared taxi, travelling on a fixed route, which costs more than a city autobus but less than a normal taxi. They can carry up to 8 passengers and may only take cash. They carry a Dolmu\u015f sign on top. They will only start driving from their terminal when all eight seats are full, which is also where the name derives from, but can be hailed along their route to fill in a spot from a passenger who previously dismounted.\nThe main and most important routes for dolmu\u015fes are :\n\nTaksim\u2013Emin\u00f6n\u00fc (Taksim stop, near the Atat\u00fcrk Cultural Centre, in Taksim square)\nTaksim\u2013Kad\u0131k\u00f6y\nTaksim\u2013Bostanci\nTaksim\u2013Aksaray (Taksim stop, Tarlabasi Avenue, close to Taksim square)\nKad\u0131k\u00f6y\u2013Bostanci (Bostanci stop, in front of the Bostanci ferry port)\nTaksim\u2013Tesvikiye (Taksim stop, in front of Patisserie Gezi, in Taksim square)\nBe\u015fikta\u015f\u2013Nisantasi (Be\u015fikta\u015f stop, in front of the Be\u015fikta\u015f - \u00dcsk\u00fcdar ferry port)\nKad\u0131k\u00f6y\u2013\u00dcsk\u00fcdar (\u00dcsk\u00fcdar stop, Near the \u00dcsk\u00fcdar - Be\u015fikta\u015f and \u00dcsk\u00fcdar - Kabata\u015f ferry port)\nIf you want the driver to make a stop, you can say \u0130necek var. (EE-neh-djek war! -- Someone's getting out.) or M\u00fcsait bir yerde. (mU-sa-EEt bir yer-deh. -- At a convenient spot.)\n\n\n=== By bicycle ===\n\nIf you can find one \u0130sbike docked bikes are very cheap to rent. However, if the \u0130sbike smartphone app, website and machines do not accept your foreign credit card you may not be able to rent the bikes without first obtaining the personalized mavi (blue) \u0130stanbulkart described above. Alternatively if you have a Turkish friend they may be willing to accept the deposit on their card, as it is only a small amount blocked for a few days per bike.\n\n\n=== Transport company contact information ===\nSubway, tram, funicular, cable car - call center: +90 850 252 88 00, website: MetroIstanbul\nBus, metro bus, nostalgic t\u00fcnel subway, nostalgic tram - call center: +90 153, website: IETT Istanbul\nIstanbul \u015eehir Hatlar\u0131 (municipal provider, ferry) - call center: +90 212 313 80 00, website: Sehir Hatlari Istanbul\nTuryol (private providers, ferry, speed boats) - call center: +90 212 251 44 21, website: Turyol\nDentur (private providers, ferry, speed boats) - call center: +90 444 63 36, website: Dentur Avrasya\nIDO (private providers, catamaran) - call center: +90 850 222 44 36, website: IDO\n\n\n== See ==\nSee also: Istanbul with children\n\n\n=== Museum Pass ===\nThe Turkish government offers a museum pass for Istanbul's many sights and museums, and key spots on Sultanahmet, for \u20ac105 as of April 2025. The pass can be bought at the entrance of many museums or online. Check out what is included, and buy it if it makes sense for you. Numerous sights can still be seen for free and the biggest joy is probably just walking around and sucking in the atmosphere.\nThe non-transferable pass is valid for five days from the date of the first visit, and allows one free entry to each of these museums:\n\nTopkap\u0131 Palace and Harem\nHagia Irene\nIstanbul Archaeological Museums\nIstanbul Mosaic Museum\nMuseum for the History of Science and Technology in Islam\nMuseum of Turkey and Islamic Arts\nGalata Mevlevi House Museum\nYildiz Palace\nRumeli Hisar Museum\nGalata Tower (Galata Kulesi Museum)\nNotably, the Hagia Sophia is not included, and tickets cost an extra \u20ac25 as of March 2024.\nIn addition to saving money when visiting these sites, the card allows you to skip the queue for tickets and go straight to the gates at some sites (Galata Tower is the notable exception). Most museums in Istanbul are closed on Mondays or Wednesdays, so checking the website first or ringing is a sensible option before setting off.\nAlternatively, you can consider buying the much more expensive Istanbul Tourist Pass, 2-day pass\ncosts \u20ac150, 3-day pass \u20ac180, 5-day pass \u20ac210, 7-day pass \u20ac235 as of March 2024. It includes entrance to all of the above museums, a couple of boat tours, three days mobile internet, and even a one-way discounted Istanbul airport transfer (\u20ac20). However, it consistently receives negative reviews due to bad organisation and intermittent problems with accessing some of its included services.\n\n\n=== Sights ===\nIndividual listings can be found in Istanbul's district articles\n\nWith its long history at the centre of empires, Istanbul offers a wealth of historic and religious places to take in. The bulk of these ancient monuments, dating back to the Roman, Byzantine, and Ottoman periods, including the Hagia Sophia, Topkap\u0131 Palace, Sultanahmet Mosque (Blue Mosque), and the Basilica Cistern are around Sultanahmet Square, while some others are dispersed throughout the peninsula of the old city, such as the former Church of the Holy Saviour in Chora (Kariye Camii), the entire inside of which is covered by mindblowing frescoes and mosaics. An impressive section of the mostly intact Theodosian walls, which mark the full length of the western boundary of the peninsula, is right next to this particular church.\nNorth of the old city, across the Golden Horn, is Galata, crowned by the Galata Tower. Istanbul Modern, with its exhibitions of contemporary Turkish art, is on the nearby waterfront of Karak\u00f6y. Another sight of the district, just north of the Tower, is the museum converted from the Dervish Hall of the Sufi Mevlevi order \u2014 those interested in the teachings of Rumi will particularly be entertained here. Further north is Istiklal Avenue, Istanbul's prominent pedestrian street running from near the Galata Tower to Taksim Square, the central square of the city.\nHeading west from the old city brings you deeper into the banks of the Golden Horn estuary. A neighbourhood perhaps well worth a visit here is Ey\u00fcpsultan, to visit the city\u2019s holiest Islamic shrine and, with all the religious people wandering around the narrow cobblestone streets in their turbans and other traditional outfits, just to see what the daily life in Ottoman Istanbul might be like. On the opposite shores of the Horn, in S\u00fctl\u00fcce is Miniaturk, the first miniature park in the city, with models from around the former Ottoman Empire.\nNorth of Taksim Square is New Istanbul, the main business district of the city. If venturing out to this direction, it's worth checking out the Military Museum, where Ottoman military music concerts (Mehter) are held every afternoon. Most of the skyscrapers of the city are located in the north of this district, around Levent and Maslak, with a totally different skyline from that of the old city. However the southern reaches of the very same district has some fine neo-classical and Art Nouveau buildings from the turn of the 20th century, around the neighbourhoods of Osmanbey, Kurtulu\u015f, and Ni\u015fanta\u015f\u0131. Just east from here, slopping down to the shore, is the banks of the European Bosphorus, lined by pleasant neighbourhoods full of waterfront mansions (yal\u0131) and a number of waterside palaces where you can admire what money could buy in times gone by.\nAcross the Bosphorus to the east is the Asian Side, centred around the historic districts of Kad\u0131k\u00f6y and \u00dcsk\u00fcdar, and perhaps best symbolized by the Maiden\u2019s Tower, at about the halfway between these districts, on an islet just offshore. The Bosphorus and Marmara coasts of this half of the city are characterized by quite picturesque neighbourhoods, overlooked by \u00c7aml\u0131ca Hill, one of the highest hills of the city affording a large panorama, with a caf\u00e9 and a pleasant park on its summit.\n\nSoutheast of the city, off the southern coast of the Asian Side are the Princes' Islands, an archipelago of nine car-free islands, characterized by stunning wooden mansions and pine groves.\nBeginning from the 2010s, many visitors to the city have wanted their trip to include, or have even devoted their whole trip to, the locations where their favourite Turkish drama series were shot. See Turkish TV series tourism for an in-depth discussion.\nAnd the cats everywhere: Catstanbul lives up to its name, and has from 125,000 to over a million feline citizens, mostly tabbies. They are usually amicable, well-fed, and healthy \u2013 simply purry \u2013 so the proper way of referring to them is \"communally-owned\" rather than \"feral\" or \"stray\".\n\n\n=== Tulips ===\n\nTulips were long ignored for their association with the 18th-century Tulip era, a period of ostentation and costly parties thrown by the Ottoman elite amidst large gardens full of tulips (and also when the first bulbs were introduced to the Netherlands from Istanbul), which was later seen as one of the reasons for the financial weakening and eventual dissolution of the empire. However, as the 21st century arrived, tulips have made a significant comeback, regaining much of their former popularity and now serve as a symbol for both Istanbul and Turkey. Depending on the cultivar, they bloom from late March to early May; pick April for the best views. While they can be seen at the sides or the central strip of many avenues of the city wherever there is enough space, for truly enjoying large patches of tulips with relatively exotic varieties, head to Sultanahmet Park and G\u00fclhane Park in Sultanahmet, Emirgan Park in the northern European Bosphorus neighbourhood of Emirgan or \u00c7aml\u0131ca Hill in the Asian Side.\n\n\n== Do ==\nIndividual listings can be found in Istanbul's district articles\n\nHamam \u2013 Sultanahmet has many historical hamams. Some are very extravagant and cater mainly to tourists.\nWaterpipe \u2013 Most of the places where you can smoke a nargile are in Yeni\u00e7eriler Caddesi, near the Kapal\u0131 \u00c7ar\u015f\u0131 (Grand Bazaar). \u00c7orlulu Ali Pa\u015fa and Koca Sinan Pa\u015fa T\u00fcrbesi are both in secluded internal courts, just around the corner from some tomb yards, while Rumeli Kahvesi is actually inside the cemetery of an old medrese, though it\u2019s not as spooky as you might think. In the south of Sultanahmet, near the sea, is Yeni Marmara (\u00c7ay\u0131ro\u011flu Sokak), where you can also sit in the terrace and enjoy the view. In Beyo\u011flu, at the Ortakahve (B\u00fcy\u00fckparmakkap\u0131), there\u2019s even the choice of a wide range of flavors. Another area with few big good looking places is the R\u0131ht\u0131m Caddesi, between Galata bridge and Istanbul Modern Museum.\n\n\n=== Walking tours ===\n\nMuseums and such: Haghia Sophia, then on to the Topkap\u0131 museum (these two should take at least three to five hours), preferably along the road in the back of the Haghia Sophia, where there are some nicely restored houses. Then on to the Blue Mosque and the square with the obelisks on it (At Meydani). Along its side is the very good Museum of Islam Art. Descend slightly and find the small Haghia Sophia with its nice garden (it was under restoration, but you probably can get in). Then uphill to the Sokollu Mehmet mosque complex, top notch tiles inside.\nTake a tram or walk to Emin\u00f6n\u00fc (where the boats leave for trips to Asia or up the Bosphorus). Visit the New Mosque at the back, then the Egyptian Bazaar next to it, and going further in that direction, locate the R\u00fcstem Pasha mosque with its excellent tiles. It's on a raised platform near an old clothes market, you may have to ask directions. Then take a cab or find a bus to Ey\u00fcpsultan mosque complex, a mile or three up the Golden Horn. Visit this Ey\u00fcpsultan complex at your leisure (the mosque is not particular, the court is, and the milling of believers, with many boys-to-be-circumcised among it; a Friday might be a good day to do this). Then, if you have the stamina, it might be nice to walk back too; maybe all the way (8 km or so), but taking a route along part of the city wall to first the famous Kariye Church with its mosaics, then on to Yavuz Selim Mosque with its great view on the Golden Horn (and a fine mosque by itself), then the Fatih Mosque (passing through some very religious and lively neighborhoods), then on to the well-restored Sehzade mosque, and next to S\u00fcleymaniye (don't forget to enjoy the view from the Golden Horn side). If you have some energy left, you might go on to the University complex, and by then you are very close to the Beyazit mosque. A book market (it\u2019s small) is behind this good, unexceptional (nice courtyard though) mosque.\n\nOnce again go to Emin\u00f6n\u00fc, but this time take the boat (those large ferries) to \u00dcsk\u00fcdar. You will arrive before a fine mosque in front, another one 400 m off to the right, slightly inland behind a traffic roundabout, and a third, very small, at the sea front. See the market stretching inland, walk about and don't forget to walk along the shore, maybe eating a fish meal in one of the bobbing boats along it. This is a good visit for late afternoon, early evening, fleeing the city. You will be joined by thousands of people going home from \"town\" but the way back will be on a near-empty ferry. The frequency of ferries will go down in the evening, so make sure there is a connection back.\nGo to the railroad station and find a Sirkeci-Halkali suburban train, and get out at (from memory, Yedikule station). You will be quite close to Yedikule, a nice fortress, and will have fine views of the city walls. The trains leave every 15 minutes or so, the ride is peculiar (the material is bad, but if you are in luck every second stop another salesman will enter and try selling his wares, it\u2019s fun). The ride is takes anywhere from twenty minutes to half an hour. This is not a \"must\", but it can be great fun.\nYou will have missed the covered bazaar in all this. That is because you will get there anyhow. If you go to Beyazit and the book market you are almost at two of its many entrances. Try and find the Nuruosmaniye Mosque and its complex at the other side, it\u2019s worth it. And after having explored the covered part, take a relaxing walk downhill, into the general direction of Emin\u00f6n\u00fc, where it is \"uncovered bazaar\" all the way. Cross the Galata bridge to see some things on the Northern side (for instance take the \"t\u00fcnel\" teleferik ride up much of the hill (entrance close to the opposite side of Galata bridge, ask around)), then continue to Taksim. Shops are of the international variety.\n\n\n==== Theodosian Walls Walk ====\n\nFrom 408 CE the original walls of Constantine were replaced in the reign of Theodosius. These walls then became the critical point of defence of the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire and their Ottoman successors. They are still almost completely intact, marking the western border of the peninsula of Old City, with some sections suffering from somewhat unsightly restoration done in early 1990s. The section around the Topkap\u0131 Gate (not to be confused with Topkap\u0131 Palace which is located in an altogether different place) can be easily accessed from Pazartekke tram station, which lies about 300 m east of the walls. Some remoter sections may not be very safe and may require some caution.\nA 7-km walk along and on these remaining portions of the city wall offers a window into antiquity and puts emphasis on Turkey\u2019s terrible historic monument legacy. Download and print a scholarly historical and technical description of the walls before you visit Istanbul; this will certainly add to the pleasure. From Emin\u00f6n\u00fc, take the Golden Horn ferry to Ayvansaray. This ferry terminal is separate from the European Bosphorus terminals adjacent and east of the Galata Bridge. Walk west through the Galata bridge underpass, then through the bus station to a pedestrian lane way which leads to the small terminal building. Leave the ferry at Ayvansaray and cross the park to the wall on the other side of the main road. You have a choice of walking up the outer wall or the inner wall but access to the top of the battlements is usually on the inside naturally enough, so go up the small street across the road which then cuts back behind the wall and the towers. Here you can climb up onto this section of unrestored wall on crumbling brick and stone and continue on some hundreds of yards climbing as necessary. This path comes to an obvious end and one can short cut back to the street. Sometimes there are dwellings and commercial enterprises hard up against the wall, sometimes a bus depot, a rubbish dump or often just the road. These walls replaced the earlier walls of Constantine in 408 CE after which they went through constant upgrade and repairs to earthquake damage. The different work done over the centuries was all of varying style and quality. Quite surprisingly there are a number of small streets still using the narrow gates. At Hoca \u00c7ak\u0131r Cd one comes across a restored section of the wall where the heights are accessed by stairs (junction of Hoca \u00c7ak\u0131r Caddesi and Kariye Bostani Sokak), some along the top of the wall of the steeper variety. This restoration from the 1980s is in conflict with the original. The wall is then breached for the main road Fevzi Pa\u015fa Cd. Cross this and continue along the street at the back of the wall. Look for foot pads and breaks in the wall which allows access and a good look around. The wall is breached again for Adnan Menderes Blv (unofficially and widely known as Vatan Caddesi). Past here one see here quite clearly the double line of defence with outer moat. The next breach is for Turgut \u00d6zal Cd (unofficially and widely known as Millet Caddesi) which hosts the tram line heading back to Sultanahmet for those who have run out of steam. Walking now on the outside of the walls, various breaks in the outer wall allow access via broken stonework or later via modern sets of steps in disrepair. Between the walls is the disquieting evidence of the number of people sleeping rough in Istanbul. Persevere in staying between the walls because soon you will arrive at another impure restoration project at Mevlanakap\u0131 Cd gate. Entry to the gate towers has been closed at the gate, so entry is only from the walls. From here it is better to proceed on the outside of the walls because market gardens occupy the moat and the city side abuts buildings. These couple of kilometres will give a further perspective of the ravages of time and earthquake on the walls.\n\nFinally you will arrive at the Golden Gate and Yedikule Fortress which fronts the Marmara Sea and was Byzantium\u2019s triumphal point of entry. This is in excellent condition not least because the Ottomans upgraded it and then used it right up to the 19th century. There is an entry fee and it has a toilet. The high walls and towers are all accessible, and one tower still has internal wooden floors. So you have now surveyed the protective land walls which kept Byzantium and the Eastern Roman Empire safe for all those years after the fall of Rome, breached only by the 4th Crusaders and the Ottomans. What of their future? Given that recent restoration work is fairly suspect scholars may think it is better to leave them be. Now return to the city either in the Emin\u00f6n\u00fc Bus (#80) from the village square outside the main gate, just wait there, or walk down Yedikule Istasyonu Cd about 300 m to the railway line to Sirkeci, both heading for centres close to Sultanahmet.\n\n\n=== The classic Bosphorus cruise ===\n\nFrom the terminal at Eminonu, the public ferry starts east of the Galata Bridge cruising to Anadolu Kavagi at the northern entrance of the European Bosphorus to the Black Sea via various stops. \nThe trip is offered both by Sehir Hatlari (state owned) and private boats. Tickets can only be bought at the ticket booth around one hour prior to departure. The departure time is early (10:35am) and is very popular, so arrive early and queue for a ticket (the ferry does not wait for people late to arrive to buy tickets). Touts for private ferry operators often attempt to sell alternative ferry tickets. They will attempt various tactics to make you feel uncomfortable, such as shifting the public ferry ticket office line to be in the hot sun and telling you that full cruise will waste a day of your stay in Istanbul. This is generally a scam, they will charge an extortionate rate, or a cheaper rate followed by an extortionate return fee. Note that the public ferry offers no audio commentary at all, it is very barebones and on you to spot sights of significance. The public ferry does not offer toilet paper and the washroom is generally in a deplorable state; you will need to bring your own toilet paper if needed and potentially wait in line for a great deal of time if you plan to use the washroom.\nThere are various other private ferry companies offering various cruises. Compared to the public ferry, they will typically charge significantly higher prices but may offer audio commentary via a loudspeaker, a washroom with toilet paper or have a shorter line. The private ferries almost exclusively offer the short Bosphorus tours.\nThe open decks are hugely popular on the weekends, so unless you have an outside seat expect people to be standing all around you constricting the view. The ferry waits some hours in Anadolu Kavagi so as you alight you are confronted by a numerous restaurants and their spruikers. \nAfter landing at Anadolu Kavagi, take the walk to the Yoros Kalesi, a strategic castle overlooking and controlling the entry to the Black Sea. The area can be dangerous and hazardous without good shoes, but the direct footpath to the castle is paved all the way, only the last 10m to the viewing points aren't. This important fortification with a commanding view has been fought over for many years and was last in use in the 19th century. It has fallen into serious disrepair, but Christian engravings are still visible in the stonework. It has a spectacular view of the mouth of the Black Sea.\nThere are restaurants actually in the castle surrounds, such as Yoros Cafe, and naturally have spectacular views but mediocre food and service. There is plenty of time left to wander back to the village for lunch. It is late afternoon before arrival back at Eminonu, but a day well spent.\n\n\n=== City passes ===\n MegaPass Istanbul, Gumussuyu, \u0130nonu Cd. No 11 (Istanbul/Galata). MegaPass Istanbul offers several city pass options combining Bosphorus cruises, guided tours, and access to key attractions. Travelers can choose from: Classic City Pass: Includes a Bosphorus cruise, guided Blue Mosque tour, transportation card with 5 rides, and access to two attractions. Premium City Pass: Adds a hop-on hop-off bus tour, a Turkish bath experience, and access to four attractions. Deluxe City Pass: Includes a dinner cruise, whirling dervish ceremony, and access to all listed attractions. The city passes are valid for 7 days from first use. \u20ac116\u2013\u20ac284, depending on the pass. (updated Jan 2025)\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nIstanbul has six clubs playing in S\u00fcper Lig, the top tier of Turkish association football: Ba\u015fak\u015fehir, Be\u015fikta\u015f, Ey\u00fcpspor, Fenerbah\u00e7e, Galatasaray (2000 UEFA Cup winner) and Kas\u0131mpa\u015fa. The first three have always been in the top tier and have international reputations. Matches between these sides are played in front of fiercely partisan sell-out crowds; getting tickets requires booking way in advance. As the atmosphere is extremely hostile to the away teams, spectators should avoid wearing away team colours after the match, and avoid any signs of crowd trouble.\nThe Turkish national stadium is Atat\u00fcrk Olympic Stadium (Atat\u00fcrk Olimpiyat Stad\u0131), a 76,000-capacity arena at the western edge of the city, use either Olimpiyat or Olimpiyat Park\u0131 metro station. It doesn't have a resident team, but several clubs have had spells here when their own stadium was unavailable.\nIstanbul also has a major basketball presence, with seven clubs set to play the 2024\u201325 season in the men's and four in the women's Basketbol S\u00fcper Ligi. Several are basketball sections of major sports clubs. Fenerbah\u00e7e is one of two BSL clubs that have permanent licenses to compete in the EuroLeague, the continent's top men's club competition. It plays home games at the \u00dclker Sports and Event Hall (Fenerbah\u00e7e \u00dclker Spor ve Etkinlik Salonu) in the Ata\u015fehir district, a few kilometers from the club's main base. Fenerbah\u00e7e also boasts a two times EuroLeague winner women's basketball section, which also plays in the \u00dclker arena. The other permanent EuroLeague participant is the standalone basketball club Anadolu Efes, playing at the city's largest indoor arena, Sinan Erdem Dome (Sinan Erdem Spor Salonu) in the Atak\u00f6y quarter of the Bak\u0131rk\u00f6y district on the city's European side. Also competing in the BSL are EuroCup winners Dar\u00fc\u015f\u015fafaka, and Galatasaray (playing at Abdi \u0130pek\u00e7i Arena), Bah\u00e7e\u015fehir (which shares its arena with Fenerbah\u00e7e), Be\u015fikta\u015f (playing at Akatlar) and B\u00fcy\u00fck\u00e7ekmece (which shares its arena with Anadolu Efes).\nIstanbulite teams have been dominating European women's volleyball (CEV) with solid contenders like Vak\u0131fBank, Eczac\u0131ba\u015f\u0131, Fenerbah\u00e7e and  Turkish Airlines -THY.\nIstanbul both hosts and is a frequent host in major tournaments such as Formula 1, WTA Tour, RedBull Flight Day, Tour of Turkey, Istanbul Marathon and Bosphorus Swim. \nAlso, running clubs are very trendy there. You can get involved in daily trips by reaching out to them in social media.\n\n\n== Learn ==\n\nMany foreigners visiting or living in Istanbul decide to study Turkish formally in a language school.\nSome of the biggest and most respected Turkish language schools in Istanbul are:\n\nITI Istanbul in 4.Levent.\nDilmer in G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fsuyu .\nIladil  in Fatih.\nT\u00f6mer, Ankara University affiliated.\nConcept Languages in Etiler.\nBo\u011fazi\u00e7i University. Runs a summer long intensive Turkish language course for all levels.\nBoth Bo\u011fazi\u00e7i University and Bilgi University have well established Study Abroad programs in English for foreigners.\nTEFL: Many foreigners living in Istanbul support themselves by teaching English. Finding a good teaching job is usually easier with a well-recognized certificate like the ones listed below:\n\nITI Istanbul in 4. Levent runs Cambridge University's CELTA and DELTA courses year-round\n\n\n=== Ottoman Turkish ===\n\nIf you already speak Turkish, Ottoman Turkish may also be interesting to learn. Ottoman Turkish was the courtly form of Turkish spoken during the era of the Ottoman Empire, and is significantly different to the form of Turkish spoken today. Approximately 80% of Ottoman Turkish words were loanwords from other languages, mostly Arabic, Persian and French. After the fall of the Ottoman Empire and the establishment of the Republic of Turkey, language reforms were implemented, including the establishment of the T\u00fcrk Dil Kurumu (Turkish Language Association), which is the official regulatory body of the Turkish language. This association, with a philosophy of linguistic purism, decided to cleanse the Turkish language of loanwords and replace them with more Turkic alternatives. As such, only about 14% of modern Turkish words are of foreign origin.\nOttoman Turkish is the key to learning about Turkey's Ottoman past. With Ottoman Turkish, not only can you read historical archives, but you can also read Ottoman literature and letters dated back to the Ottoman period. In Istanbul, you can learn Ottoman Turkish from the following places:\n\n\u0130smek [212 531 01 41|+90 212 531 01 41] \u0130skenderpa\u015fa Mahallesi, Ahmediye Caddesi, Hac\u0131 Salih Efendi Sokak, 6 Fatih.\nTarih Vakf\u0131 [212 522 02 02|+90 212 522 02 02] Zindankap\u0131 De\u011firmen Sokak, 15 Emin\u00f6n\u00fc.\n\n\n== Work ==\n\nThere is always a high demand for qualified - and, to a lesser extent, unqualified - ESOL/EFL teachers in Istanbul. Many teachers work with private instructional companies. Others contract out on a freelance basis.\nIstanbul is Turkey's financial capital. All big investment banks, commercial banks, large foreign retail and consumer companies have offices in Istanbul. The business district has been coming up with high-rise buildings and business centers in the last decade.\n\n\n== Buy ==\n\n\n=== Money ===\nEuro and US dollar are accepted at places frequented by tourists. Although, certain tourist attractions only accept liras. Currency exchanges (d\u00f6viz b\u00fcrosu) and banks are plentiful in Istanbul and offer extremely competitive exchange rates. If you are planning to visit Istanbul, bring hard foreign currency and exchange them after you arrive (not at the airport!), preferably at a bank or a currency exchange. Exchange rates at the airport are terrible, only in the city you well get excellent rates with a sell-buy-spread of about 1-2%. All major currencies are accepted as well, but rates are not that excellent. Exchange leftover lira directly before leaving, in many foreign countries it can be hard to get rid of them at a proper rate.\n\n\n=== Shopping ===\nIndividual listings can be found in Istanbul's district articles\nConnecting east and west, the will to control the major trading routes was the reason why Istanbul was founded in the first place, so shopping should definitely not be overlooked in your Istanbul experience.\nContrary to the rest of the world, shops in Istanbul are usually open during weekends. Most major shopping malls have security checkpoints you usually see in airports and museums prior to entry.\n\n\n==== What ====\n\nHere are some of what are popular to buy while in the city:\n\nTurkish Delight, or Lokum (as the locals call it) \u2013 A good buy since you're in Turkey. It is advisable to buy it fresh rather than in pre-packed boxes and to get a variety of flavours rather than the stereotypical rose-water or lemon flavors available abroad. Pistachio in particular is very good. The best place to buy lokum in Istanbul is from a store. Istiklal Caddesi in particular features a number of stores that sell Turkish sweets by the kilogram including lokum and helvah. There are quite a few shops selling Turkish Delight in the Grand Bazaar, although unless you are very good at haggling better prices can be found elsewhere.\nTurkish Tea (\u00e7ay, chai) \u2013 The national drink of Turkey, brewed from leaves grown on the steep, verdant mountain slopes of Turkey's eastern Black Sea coast. Traditionally, Turkish tea is brewed samovar-style, with a small pot of very strong tea sitting on a larger vessel of boiling water. Pour a small amount of strong tea into a little tulip-shaped glass and cut it to the desired strength with hot water. Turks usually add cube sugar (never milk, although you can often get milk if you ask.) Having fresh, hot tea always available everywhere is one of life's splendid little luxuries in Turkey. Elma \u00c7ay\u0131: apple tea, like hot apple juice (EHL-mah chah-yee) is the flavour of preference, although it's more for tourists; Turks prefer Siyah \u00c7ay (black tea).\nTurkish Coffee Roasted and then finely ground coffee beans are boiled in a pot (cezve), usually with sugar, and served in a cup where the grounds are allowed to settle. A classic of Turkish culture. Some people use the remaining coffee grounds to tell their fortune.\nNuts & Spices A wide selection of nuts and spices can be found in Spice Bazaar and other cental spots such as \u00dcsk\u00fcdar.\nRugs and kilims \u2013 Can be a good buy while in the city. Most rug-specialized stores in the city, though, are aimed at tourist trade, so pick up basics of bargaining to avoid being ripped off at these stores. They are mostly located around Sultanahmet.\nJewelry \u2013 Istanbul has exceptional handicraft from both Armenian and Turkish craftsmen, making it one of the top places for buying jewelry while having unique items such as chalcedony semi-precious gemstone named after the nearby town of Chalcedon, and is sold in many of Istanbul's multitude of jewelery shops.\n\n\n==== Where ====\nIstanbul's Ottoman bazaars with an oriental ambiance, once sitting firmly on the western terminii of the Silk Road and spice routes, are all located in the  peninsula of the Old City. Note, many are very touristy nowadays, and they are good for taking some nice pictures. But shopping should be only be done where the tourist-local ratio is very low, e.g. prices at the Spice Market (Emin\u00f6n\u00fc) are twice or triple as high as in the rest of the city.\nOn the other hand, modern shopping malls (al\u0131\u015fveri\u015f merkezi, usually shortened to AVM), popping all around the city since the 1990s, are mostly to be found in eastern and the western suburbs, though they are by no means exclusively located in these districts.\nTextile wholesale business is concentrated in Laleli, while upscale fashion retail in Ni\u015fanta\u015f\u0131 in the European Side and Ba\u011fdat Avenue in the Asian Side.\n\n\n== Eat ==\nIndividual listings can be found in Istanbul's district articles\nFor a full-on culinary experience, one should look for esnaf lokantas\u0131 restaurants. They are essentially old-school canteens with a variety of traditional selections from soups to main courses to desserts.\n\n\n=== Snacks ===\n\nBal\u0131k-Ekmek. Balik-Ekmek (literally \"fish and bread\") consists of freshly grilled fish, typically mackerel, served in a crusty bread roll with lettuce, onions, and sometimes tomatoes, often accompanied by a squeeze of lemon and a sprinkle of spices. It\u2019s a flavorful and iconic snack often enjoyed by the waterfront.\nBoiled and roasted corn on the cob is sold from carts around the city, and is a fantastic snack to walk around. Price varies from cart to cart and area of the city.\nD\u00f6ner: A beloved Turkish dish made from seasoned meat (such as lamb, chicken, or beef) cooked on a vertical rotisserie. Thin slices are shaved off as the outer layer roasts and are served in various forms\u2014wrapped in flatbread (d\u00fcr\u00fcm), stuffed into a sandwich, or plated with rice and salad. It's a staple of Turkish cuisine and a global street food favorite.\nD\u00fcr\u00fcm Kebap: D\u00fcr\u00fcm kebaps are a type of Turkish wrap where grilled meat, such as Adana (spiced minced meat), ci\u011fer (liver) or \u015fi\u015f (skewered chunks), is wrapped in thin flatbread, like lavash or yufka. They're typically accompanied by vegetables, herbs, and sauces, offering a convenient and flavorful way to enjoy kebabs on the go.\nFreshly squeezed juice and juice blends are sold from stands and small shops all around the city and are a refreshing treat (especially in the warmer months). The combinations range from a simple orange juice to the rarer options like pomegranate or kiwi. Price varies from shop to shop, area of the city and complexity of your order.\nIslak Hamburger & Patso Islak or 'Wet' Burger is a Turkish street food classic featuring a soft bun and a meat patty drenched in a garlicky, tomato-based sauce, then steamed to give it a moist, flavorful texture. Patso is a popular Turkish snack, consisting of a sandwich filled with French fries, often accompanied by ketchup, mayonnaise, or sausage slices, making it a simple yet satisfying fast-food treat.\nKokore\u00e7: A traditional Turkish street food made from seasoned and skewered lamb or goat intestines, wrapped around sweetbreads, and grilled over charcoal. It is typically chopped, mixed with spices, and served in bread or on a plate, offering a flavorful and aromatic experience.\nKumpir: It consists of a baked potato with various fillings such as grated cheese, mayonnaise, ketchup, pickles, sliced red cabbage, sweetcorn, sausage slices, carrots, mushrooms, and Russian salad among others, any of which can be added to or omitted from the mix. While kumpir can be had at many cafes throughout the city, it is best had from one of the cafes in Ortak\u00f6y, which have a long tradition of preparing kumpir and offer really filling and tasty ones.\nLahmacun & Pide: Lahmacun or 'Turkish Pizza' is a thin, round Turkish flatbread topped with a mixture of minced meat, herbs, and spices, often served with lemon and parsley for rolling and eating like a wrap. Pide is a boat-shaped Turkish flatbread filled with various toppings such as cheese, minced meat, vegetables, or eggs, baked to a golden crisp. Both are often served sprinkled with lemon juice and wrapped around vegetables, including pickles, tomatoes, peppers, onions, lettuce.\nRoasted chestnuts are sold from carts around the city and is a very nice snack to have when the weather is cold, as it keeps your hands warm. Most commonly eaten in winter time, but they are available year-round.\nPo\u011fa\u00e7a & Simit: Po\u011fa\u00e7a is a soft, fluffy Turkish pastry made with yeast or baking powder, often filled with ingredients like cheese, olives, or potatoes. Simit is a sesame-crusted Turkish bread ring, similar to a bagel but lighter and crunchier. It's typically enjoyed as a street snack, paired with tea, cheese, or jam. Both are staples of Turkish bakery culture and frequently sold on street carts.\nAlso, some \u015ferbet, which is mainly sold by peddlers around touristic areas. They usually wear traditional clothing and back\u2013barrels.\n\n\n== Drink ==\nIndividual listings can be found in Istanbul's district articles\n\nMeyhanes are taverns which originated in Ottoman times. They come in both 'traditional' and 'modern' accents, some even with some belly dancing. One could find them mostly on the seaside districts of both sides.\n\nBebek is a small town on the European Bosphorus, 10 km north of downtown, with fancy restaurants and bars. Great place to have a walk on the seaside after a nice dinner.\nBa\u011fdat Caddesi is a very long avenue full of good restaurants, boutiques and high-end stores on the south Anatolia side of Istanbul.\nBeyo\u011flu has lively night life, with cafes and bars with live music.\nKad\u0131k\u00f6y also has a compact nightlife scene, serving mostly locals of this part of the city. It's easy-going, with local pubs and wine houses.\nKarak\u00f6y is the rising star of the city, with its underground parties with views over the Marmara Sea.\nNi\u015fanta\u015f\u0131 is the place for young entrepreneurs and artists, but prices are higher than in Taksim.\nNightclubs are found all over the city, but most popular ones are in Pera and Ortak\u00f6y.\n\n\n== Sleep ==\nIndividual listings can be found in Istanbul's district articles\n\nIn general, it is possible to find some kind of accommodation in any part of Istanbul. Here is a quick list of the areas where they are concentrated most:\n\nHarbiye is a popular place to stay; it's close to the main centre of the new city on the European side, and contains a variety of international standard apartments, hotels, and moderate hotels for budget travelers. Ni\u015fanta\u015f\u0131 and Taksim are quite close so you can stay in Harbiye and benefit from all activities in those areas.\nTaksim is the main centre of the city on the European side. Locals and tourists go to Taksim for shopping and entertainment, and it has moderate hotels for budget travelers. There are also hostels in this area.\nSultanahmet the main centre for the old city on the European side. It has a selection of quality, reasonably priced hotels, many with terraces overlooking the Golden Horn, or with views of the Marmara Sea and the Blue Mosque. Most hostel-type accommodation frequented by independent travellers are located in this district, although it is possible to find a few upmarket hotels.\nUpscale hotels can be found in the western suburbs, especially around the former airport, as well as on or near the banks of the European Bosphorus.\nCaravan parks exist in Ah\u0131rkap\u0131 south of Sultanahmet, in Maltepe in the Maltepe and in the outlying villages on both sides of the Bosphorus.\n\n\n== Stay safe ==\n\nIn Istanbul, most drivers won't abide any rules. Even if you have priority on a road junction, crosswalk, or even during green light, always be aware of your surroundings. Even if you are in a one way road, check both sides before crossing the road. It is common for Turkish drivers to use shortcuts.\nA major earthquake with epicenter in the nearby Sea of Marmara is expected within the next few decades, so read the earthquake safety article before you arrive.\nIf prices are not on display, always ask beforehand (even for a tea) instead of just ordering something like in Europe. This can be fatal in Istanbul because tourists are constantly overcharged. Unfortunately, often prices are not on display, like in sweet shops or even restaurants. Skip these places or ask for a price knowing what the approximate or fair price is.\nIstanbul is home to three of the biggest clubs in Turkey and maybe European football: Be\u015fikta\u015f, Fenerbah\u00e7e, and Galatasaray. It is advisable not to wear your jersey on the days of matches between the sides due to the fearsome rivalry they share. If you are supporting the away team whenever the Turkish national team plays in Istanbul, be very careful as violent attacks on fans and players of the opposing team have been known to occur.\n\n\n=== Scams ===\n\n\n==== Bar and club scams ====\nHigh-drink price scams encountered in so-called night-clubs mostly located in Aksaray, Beyazit and Taksim areas. These clubs usually charge overpriced bills, based on a replica of the original menu, or simply on the menu that had been standing upside down on the table. Two or three drinks can already produce a fantasy bill.\nAlso be aware of friendly behaving groups of young men or male-female couples striking up a conversation in the street and inviting you to a \"good nightclub they know\". This has frequently been reported as a prelude to such a scam. The people in on the scam may offer to take you to dinner first, in order to lower your suspicions. Another way they will try to lure you in is by talking to you in Turkish, and when you mumble back in your language they will be surprised you're not Turkish and immediately will feel the urge to repay you for their accident with a beer.\nAnother variant of this involves an invitation in Taksim to male tourists to buy them beer (as they were \"guests\"). At the club, attractive women, also with beers, join them. When the bill comes, the person inviting the tourists denies having said he would pay for the drinks, and a large bill is presented, when the tourists object, burly \"security\" personnel emerge to accompany the tourists to an ATM (presumably to clean out their bank account). Any bar that looks like it could be a strip club is more than likely a scam joint.\nIn either of these scams, if you refuse to pay the high prices or try to call the police (dial #112) to file a complaint, the club managers may use physical intimidation to bring the impasse to a close. If you find yourself in such a situation for any reason, you should do whatever they want you to do, pay the bill, buy the things they are forcing you to buy, etc. Try to get out of the situation as soon as possible, go to a safe place and call the police.\n\n\n==== Blue Mosque scam \"guides\" ====\n\nWhen walking through the gates of the Blue Mosque, beware of smiling, friendly chaps who offer immediately to be your de-facto guide through the mosque and its surrounds; they'd be pretty informative on just about anything relating to the mosque; etiquette, history and Islamic practices. However, they eventually demand a price for their \"services\". You would be better off booking a private tour online; or not at all, since the mosque is essentially free to all anyway. \n\n\n==== Lira/euro scams ====\n\nA frequent scam, often in smaller hotels (but it can also happen in a variety of other contexts), is to quote prices in lira and then later, when payment is due, claim the price was given in euros. Hotels which reject payment early in a stay and prefer you to \"pay when you leave\" should raise suspicions. Hotels which operate this scam often offer excellent service and accommodation at a reasonable price and know most guests will conclude as much and pay without complaint - thus this can be a sign of a good hotel.\nAnother scam is coin-related and happens just as you're walking into the streets. A Turkish guy holds you and asks where you are from. If you mention a euro-country, the guy wants you to change a \u20ac50-note from you into \u20ac2-coins he is showing. He is holding the coins stack-wise in his hands. For the trouble, he says he will offer you '30 \u20ac2-coins, making \u20ac60 in total'. Do not agree with this exchange of money, as the first coin is indeed a \u20ac2-coin, but (many of) the rest of the coins will probably be 1-lira coins (looking very similar), but worth only 1/4 of the value of \u20ac2.\nMany bars in the Taksim area give you counterfeit bills. They are usually well-made and hard to identify as fakes in the dark. One way to verify a bill's authenticity is to check its size against another one. Another is to hold the bill up to a strong light, face side up, and check for an outline of the same face which is on the bill. The value of the bill (20, 50, etc.) should appear next to the outline, light and translucent. If either of these two security features are missing, try to have the bill changed or speak to the police.\nSome taxi drivers agree on a price only to tell you your lira bills are counterfeit, or invalid, or have a wrong serial number. This is a scam to have you paying in Euro or USD, usually for a much higher price since they'll claim they don't have change.\n\n\n==== Restaurant scams ====\n\nA notable scam for convincing tourists to visit overpriced restaurants with mediocre food involves the following:\nWhile walking along, you are overtaken by a Turkish man who claims to recognize you from the hotel at which you are staying (e.g. he will tell you that he works there as a waiter or a receptionist). He will ask where you are going. If you are going out for food, he will recommend a restaurant, claiming that it is where he takes his family or friends when they eat out. He may give you some other advice (e.g. the best time to visit the Topkapi palace) to make the conversation feel genuine and friendly. The restaurant he recommends will almost certainly be mediocre or low quality, and the staff there will try to sell you expensive dishes without you realizing. For instance, they may promote dishes which are marked as 'MP' (market price) on the menu, such as 'salt fish' (fish baked in salt). They may also serve you additional dishes which you haven't ordered and then add them to the bill for an additional money, together with extra charges for service and tax. One restaurant that seems to be using this scam to get customers is Haci Baba in Sultanahmet.\nIn Taksim, a variety of restaurateurs have taken to literally grabbing your arm and pleading with you in a friendly demeanour to eat at their restaurants. If a restaurateur is resorting to aggressive tout tactics, you are obviously being scammed.\n\n\n==== Shoe shine scam ====\n\nSome men will walk around tourist-frequented areas with a shoeshine kit, and the brush will fall off right in front of a tourist or group of tourists. This will cause the tourist with a conscience to pick up the brush and return it to the owner. He will then express gratitude and offer to shine your shoes for free. While doing that, he will talk about how he is from another city, that he is poor, and how he has a sick child or wife. At the end, the shiner will demand a hefty price for its \"free\" services, way beyond the actual market norm. Many tourists will pay up out of guilt; don't do that, as it will just encourage them!\nA similar trick is getting asked for a cigarette, after which the scammer will proceed similarly.\n\n\n==== Taxi drivers ====\n\nTaxis are plentiful in Istanbul and inexpensive by Western European and American standards. They can be picked up at taxi hubs throughout the city or on the streets. Empty cabs on the streets will honk at pedestrians to see if they would like a ride, or cabs can be hailed by pedestrians by making eye contact with the driver and waving. Few taxi drivers speak languages other than Turkish, but do a fair job at deciphering mispronounced location names given by foreign riders. It is advisable to have the name of the destination written down and try to have a map beforehand to show the driver, to avoid any misunderstanding and also potential scams. Though taxis are plentiful, be aware that taxis are harder to find during peak traffic hours and traffic jams and when it is raining and snowing. They are also less frequent during nights, depending on the area and are hard to find after midnight.\nTry to avoid using taxis for short distances (5\u201310 minutes of walk) if possible. Some taxi drivers can be annoyed with this, especially if you called the cab from a taxi hub instead of hailing it from the street. If you want taxis for short distances, just hail them from the street, do not go to the taxi hub.\nFew taxis have seatbelts, and some drivers may seem to be reckless. If you wish for the driver to slow down, say \"yavash l\u00fctfen\" (slow please). Your request may or may not be honored.\nAs in any major city, tourists are more vulnerable to taxi scams than locals. Be aware that taxi drivers use cars affiliated with a particular hub, and that the name and phone number of the hub, as well as the license plate number, are written on the side of each car. Noting or photographing this information may be useful if you run into problems. In general, riding in taxis affiliated with major hotels (Hilton, Marriot, Ritz, etc.) is safe, and it is not necessary to stay in these hotels to use a taxis leaving from their hubs.\nOthers may take unnecessarily long routes to increase the amount due (although sometimes alternate routes are also taken to avoid Istanbul traffic, which can be very bad). Some scams involve the payment transaction; for example, if the rider pays 50 TL when only 20 TL are needed, the driver may quickly switch it with a 5 TL note and insist that the rest of the 20 TL is still due or may switch the real bill for a fake one and insist that different money be given.\nMethods to avoid taxi scams:\n\n1. Sit in the front passenger seat. Watch the meter. Watch the driver's actions (beeping the horn, pumping the brakes, etc.) and note what the taximeter does. While it is rare, some drivers will wire parts of their controls to increase the fare upon activation. If you're with your significant other, do it anyway. Save the cuddling for after the ride. Check if the seal on the taximeter is broken. Use your phone for light. This will make the driver realize that you are cautious. For women it is better to sit in the back seat (where you can see the meter from the middle), as there are occasionally problems with taxi drivers getting overly friendly, and sitting in the front is a sign that a woman welcomes such behavior.\n2. Ask \"How much to go to...?\" (basic English is understood), before getting in the taxi. Price will be quite accurate to the one in the taximeter at the end of the ride. If the price sounds ok for you, get in the cab and tell them to put the Taximeter on. The rate they are applying is same during night and day.\n3. Know the route. If you have a chance, find a map and demand that the driver take your chosen route to the destination. Oftentimes they will drive the long way or pretend not to know where you're going in order to get more money out of you. If the driver claims not to know the route to a major landmark or gathering place, refuse his services as he is likely lying.\n4. Choose an elderly driver. Elderly taxi drivers are less likely to cheat passengers.\n5. Let taxi driver see money on your hands and show values and take commitment on it. This is 50 lira. OK? Take this 50 lira and give 30 lira back OK?. This guarantees your money value. Otherwise, your 50 lira can be 5 lira immediately on his hands. Try to have always 10 lira or 20 lira bills in your wallet. This makes money scams in general more difficult. If you realize that the driver tried to use the 50 lira to 5 lira trick on you, call the police (#155) immediately and write down the license plate. If a driver claims not to have change, you may want to consider sitting in the taxi and pointing to a nearby shop to have them break their bills there. This will usually cause them to magically find the necessary change, or frustrate them into accepting a lower fare. \n6. Create a big scene if there is a problem. If you are absolutely positive you have been subject to a scam, threaten to or call the police and, if you feel it will help, start yelling. Taxi drivers will only rip off those they think will fall for it; creating a scene draws attention to them and will make it easier to pay the correct rate.\n\n\n=== Overpricing ===\n\nWatch the menu carefully in street cafes for signs that prices are not discriminatory \u2014 if prices are clearly over-inflated, simply leave. A good indication of over inflation is the circulation of two different types of menu \u2014 the \"foreigner\" menu is typically printed on a laminated card with menu prices written in laundry marker/texta, i.e., prices not be printed; in these cases, expect that prices for foreigners will be highly inflated (300% or higher).\nWhile this is not really a problem in Beyo\u011flu or Ortak\u00f6y, avoiding the open air cafes toward the rear courtyard of the Spice Bazaar (Sultanahmet) is wise. The area immediately north of the Spice Bazaar is also crawling with touts for these 'infamous' cafes.\nHaving nargile (water pipe) is a famous activity in Istanbul,Tophane (top-hane) is a famous location for this activity where a huge number of nargile shops are available and can easily be reached by the tram, avoiding a place called \"Ali Baba\" in Tophane is wise, usually you will be served there with plates you did not ask for like a nuts plate, and expect to have a bill of around US$50 for your nargile!\n\n\n=== Pickpockets ===\n\nAs with most European cities, but especially in crowded areas of Istanbul, watch your pockets and travel documents as pickpockets have devised all sorts of strategies to obtain them from you. Do not rely too much on the 'safe' feeling you get from the omnipresence of police.\nAlso be wary of men in Taksim who splash water on the backs of your neck. When you turn around, they will try to start a fight with you as another man comes in and robs you. These men tend to carry knives and can be very dangerous.\nThe public transportation is also prone to pickpocketing because they are chaotic and frequented by tourists. The pickpocketing is generally unrelated to the scam artist operations. You should be especially careful to place your wallet in your front pocket here and to be mindful of your belongings. If someone touches you or places their hand on your shoulder at any point while in or near the Metro system, you are being pickpocketed and you should immediately turn in an unexpected direction, especially if you have belongings in your back pocket.\n\n\n=== Stalking ===\n\nThere were some instances of men stalking foreign women may be present in tourist locations. Such men may presume that foreigners have a lot of money or liberal values and may approach foreign women in a flirtatious or forward manner looking for sex or for money (either by theft or selling over-priced goods). If you are being harassed, use common sense and go to where other people are; often this is the nearest store. Creating a public scene will deter many stalkers, and these phrases may be useful in such cases:\n\n\u0130mdat! \u2013 \"Help!\"\nAy\u0131p! \u2013 \"Rude!\"\nB\u0131rak beni! \u2013 \"Leave me alone!\"\nDur! \u2013 \"Stop!\"\nGider misin?! \u2013 \"Will you go?!\"\nOr to really ruin him:\n\nBeni takip etme! \u2013 \"Stop stalking me!\"\nPolisi ar\u0131yorum \u2013 \"I'm calling the cops!\"\nOccasionally try not to use Turkish as the stalker will like it more, just scream and run and find a safer place with crowd and police.\n\n\n=== Tourism Police ===\nIstanbul PD has a \"Tourism Police\" unit where travelers may report passport loss and theft or any other crime they are victimized by. They have an office in Sultanahmet and can reportedly speak English, German, French, Arabic and Russian.\n\n1 Tourism Police (Turizm Polisi), Divan Yolu Cd ( T1  Sultanahmet 130 m), \u260f +90 212 527 45 03, istanbulturizm@egm.gov.tr. \n\n\n== Stay healthy ==\n\nTap water may not be safe depending on where you drink it. Although the tap water itself is clean, many local water tanks are not maintained properly, and one should try to avoid tap water if possible. Locals widely prefer bottled water and the same applies for the restaurants. Expect to pay for water in restaurants. Although there are fountains nearly everywhere.\nFood and drinks are mostly of international standards. Some Turkish foods are known to use a variety of spices which may affect international tourists who may not be accustomed to such ingredients, although most of it is edible for any tongue.\nUse common sense when buying certain foods, particularly from street vendors. Delicacies such as \"Firin Sutlac\" (a kind of rice pudding) can go bad rapidly on a hot day, as can the oysters occasionally for sale on the streets.\n\n\n== Connect ==\n\nFor general information on SIM cards, Wi-Fi and Internet see the country article.\n\n\n=== Telephone codes ===\nIstanbul is the only city or province in Turkey that uses multiple area codes: 212 for the European side, 216 for the Asian side and Princes' Islands. When calling from one continent to the other, you need to dial as if it\u2019s an intercity call: 0+area code (212 or 216)+7-digit telephone number. It may appear as an intercity call, but is charged at local rate. Without the area code, your call will not be automatically routed to the number in the other continent, and much of the number sets are used on both sides of the Bosphorus. When calling landlines from mobile, you have to dial the area code regardless of the continent you are in.\n\n\n=== Mobile ===\nIstanbul has 4G from all Turkish carriers. 5G is rolled out only in particular places with full launch expected at 2026. Metropolitan Municipality has an app for iOS and Android phones. Free WiFi could be found on squares and buses. The buses also have USB outlets for charging.\n\n\n== Cope ==\nIstanbul's less-than-scrupulous hotel and restaurant owners are as market savvy as they come\u2014they read the popular travel guides to Istanbul and when they get listed or favorably reviewed, they raise prices through the roof and skimp on costs. For mid-range and cheap hotels/restaurants, you may have a better time if you avoid places listed in the most popular guidebooks. Trust your nose.\n\n\n=== Consulates ===\n\nMany of the consulates in Istanbul are housed in elegant and imposing buildings dating back to the previous centuries, when they served as embassies to the Ottoman Empire, before its collapse and the move of the capital to Ankara by the then-newly established republic. An interesting fact about them is that they are all located in the Beyo\u011flu area with one exception, the Iranian consulate, as the imperial authorities did not allow representatives from non-Muslim lands to be based within the official borders of the city at that time, which more or less equaled to the peninsula of the Old City.\n\n\n== Go next ==\n\n\n=== West ===\nThe area of European Turkey to the west of Istanbul is called Thrace. It has many historic towns with Byzantine and Ottoman heritage.\n\nEdirne, two hours to the northwest, is a beautiful historic city, and was the Ottoman capital before power moved to Istanbul. You need at least a day here. A slow scenic route winds north via K\u0131y\u0131k\u00f6y, ancient Medea, a fisherman's village on the Black Sea with some traditional architecture, partially rebuilt ancient city walls and a nearby rock-cut monastery. The next town on that route is Vize, an old town with a well preserved Byzantine cathedral.\nHead into Western Europe either via Sofia in Bulgaria or Bucharest in Romania.\nOr perhaps you can follow the ancient Via Egnatia all the way to the Adriatic and across to Rome.\n\n\n=== South ===\nThe Marmara Islands are across the sea, much further away and less urban than the Princes Islands just offshore of the city.\nBursa to the southeast is a former Ottoman capital with many historical sights plus Uluda\u011f National Park just south. \u0130znik, rich in Byzantine, Seljuk, and early Ottoman heritage, is worth a detour on the way.\nA scenic route towards Izmir is to head west then south into the Gallipoli peninsula, with its World War I sites, cross the Dardanelles to \u00c7anakkale, then past ancient Troy and Pergamon (Bergama). A short ferry-ride brings you to the charming island of Bozcaada. For more detailed descriptions, see Istanbul to Izmir.\n\n\n=== East ===\nIn Istanbul you've only stepped on the threshold of Asian Turkey. Continue east across Anatolia for so much more: rejuvenated Ankara, unworldly Cappadocia, surreal Mount Nemrut, faraway Kars. And further still across the lands of the former Ottoman Empire: follow in the footsteps of ancient traders, medieval travellers, pilgrims, and hippies."

        "title": "Budapest",
        "extract": "Budapest is the capital city of Hungary. With a unique, youthful atmosphere, world-class classical music scene, a pulsating nightlife increasingly appreciated among European youth, and last but not least, an exceptional offer of natural thermal baths, Budapest is one of Europe's most delightful and enjoyable cities. Due to the exceedingly scenic setting, and its architecture it is nicknamed \"Paris of the East\".\nThe modern-day Budapest results from the amalgamation of two historic cities lying right opposite each other over the Danube river. Buda is the western (left) bank side, with the high hill atop which the Buda castle sits. Pest is the relatively flat eastern (right) bank side, with the Parliament, numerous other stately buildings, and busy streets retaining all their 19th century architectural heritage.\nIn 1987 Budapest was added to the  UNESCO World Heritage Site for the cultural and architectural significance of the Banks of the Danube, the Buda Castle Quarter and Andr\u00e1ssy Avenue.\n\n\n== Districts ==\nAlthough Budapest is administratively divided into 23 numbered districts (always written in Roman numerals) it is colloquially often divided into parts, roughly corresponding to the two major cities of Buda and Pest, which it comprises.\nListings of particular points of interests - museums, historic monuments, restaurants, bars, hotels, shopping opportunities and such - can be found in the following articles:\n\n\n=== Inner city ===\n\n\n=== Outer Buda ===\n\n\n=== Outer Pest ===\n\nOf course, quarters often offer their own atmosphere due to their history and inhabitants. Roughly speaking, areas near to, especially inside of Nagyk\u00f6r\u00fat (Great Boulevard or Ringroad, served by Tram 4 and Tram 6) are considered central, even if some of these are in less than perfect condition and not typically frequented by tourists. In Pest, Kisk\u00f6r\u00fat (Small Boulevard) is traditionally considered as the border of the centre proper, including some highly touristed areas.\n\nInformally, quarters are known under their own historical name which are often referred to by the locals. The names are often linked to members of the House of Hapsburg or - in fringe areas - the names of villages or towns which later became part of Budapest. Particularly interesting quarters are Belv\u00e1ros (Inner City) and Lip\u00f3tv\u00e1ros (Leopold Town), together form the Belv\u00e1ros district (a bit confusing but usually the biggest or oldest quarter gave its name to the entire district), the heart of Pest, including a number of major sights but also beautiful squares and caf\u00e9s. With the Parliament, a number of ministries and banking houses, Lip\u00f3tv\u00e1ros is also a major political and business centre of the country. The name refers to the Hapsburg Emperor Leopold I whose coronation to the King of Hungary in 1790 gave rise to the name of the then-new quarter.\n\u00dajlip\u00f3tv\u00e1ros (New Leopold Town) The inner part of the XIII. district (so called Angyalf\u00f6ld), just outside of the Great Boulevard north of Leopold Town with the marvellous Margaret Bridge at its corner, was built between the 1910s and 1930s. It is considered as one of the finest residential areas in Budapest with a relaxed, inviting atmosphere and a number of restaurants, caf\u00e9s and small shops. It also comprises the V\u00edgsz\u00ednh\u00e1z (Comedy Theatre) and a few tiny off-mainstream cinemas. The quarter is traditionally home to a population with Jewish background as the activity of people such as Raoul Wallenberg, Giorgio Perlasca, and Carl Lutz was linked to this area (see history).\nTer\u00e9zv\u00e1ros (Theresa Town) VI. district. Among others, it contains Nyugati pu. (Western Railway Station), an architectural sight, and areas neighbouring districts V. and XIII. The then-developing quarter was named after a visit of Habsburg Empress and Queen Maria Theresa in 1777.\nErzs\u00e9betv\u00e1ros (Elisabeth Town) VII. District. While parts of it are not yet renovated, it contains the famous Synagogue in the Doh\u00e1ny street. The quarter was split off from Ter\u00e9zv\u00e1ros and asked for permission to be named after the wife of Franz-Josef I, popularly called Sisi, in 1882.\n\n\n== Understand ==\n\n\n=== History ===\n\n\n==== Antiquity ====\nThe first settlement on the territory of Budapest is accounted to Celtic tribes. During the first century CE, the Roman fortification on the territory of present-day \u00d3buda (now part of Budapest) gradually developed into the town of Aquincum which became the capital city of the province of Lower Pannonia in 106CE. The Romans founded a fortress known as Contra Aquincum on the other side of the river which is assumed to have developed into the later town of Pest. This was part of the Limes, marking the eastern border of the empire, and was gradually given up by Rome during the early fourth century, becoming part of the Hun empire for a few decades. The Huns were a confederation of various nomadic nations and tribes inhabiting the Eurasian steppe, and not Magyars, but Attila, the King of the Huns, is considered a national hero and Attila is a common given name in Hungary.\n\n\n==== Early Middle Ages ====\nOnce the horse-riding Magyar (Hungarian) tribes arrived in the Carpathian Basin in 896CE, \u00d3buda served as the seat of the Magyar high-chieftain (or prince) \u00c1rp\u00e1d. After a century marked by frequent raids on Christian western Europe, the erstwhile Hungarian prince G\u00e9za realised that converting to Christianity was the key to survival in Europe. The Christian Kingdom of Hungary was founded by the crowning of his son, Szt. Istv\u00e1n (Saint Stephen) on 1 January 1001 (or possibly Christmas Day of 1000). As visitors will quickly realise, Saint Stephen became an omnipresent national symbol, as did the artefact known as Saint Stephen's Crown (the Holy Crown of Hungary) which was regarded as a legal entity that was by law equivalent to the country itself during medieval times. It is still unclear whether the millennium-old crown used in this function for many centuries and shown in the Parliament today, was used by Saint Stephen.\nIn the following centuries, Buda emerged as the most important royal seat. In 1241/42 the Mongol Empire conquered the territory along with large parts of Europe - this short but devastating conquest of the country is still remembered as Tat\u00e1rj\u00e1r\u00e1s - the name reflecting the erroneous confusion of Mongols and Tatars at the time. Medieval Hungary reached its zenith under King Matthias (Matthias Corvinus), the vividly remembered Renaissance ruler whose patronage of arts and sciences made Hungary, a notable power at the time, the first European country to adopt the Renaissance from Italy. However, after residing in Buda for decades, he moved his seat to Vienna in 1485 for the last five years of his life after defeating the Hapsburg Holy Roman Emperor Frederick III.\nIn 1541, Buda and Pest fell to the Ottoman Empire and were taken back 1686, when the Hapsburg Empire centred in Austria conquered the country on its way to becoming a major European power. Marks of these two cultures are still part of everyday life in Budapest.\n\n\n==== The 19th-century - formation of Austria-Hungary and Budapest ====\nAfter the anti-Hapsburg revolution in 1848\u201349 (defeated through the decisive help of the Russian Czar) the 1867 Compromise (Kiegyez\u00e9s) with a weakened Vienna made Buda the capital of a near-autonomous Hungary, a large, multi-ethnic kingdom comprising half of the newly created Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary. In this peculiar double-state the monarch was Emperor of Austria and King of Hungary, two autonomous realms.\nThe following half century marked by peaceful development counts among the most successful times in the history of the country and its capital. With the 1873 unification of Buda, Pest, and \u00d3buda, the city of Budapest was created. It saw a leap in terms of industrialisation, urbanisation, population, and the development of a capitalistic society. It even aimed at rivalling with Vienna, the Millennium in 1896, marking a thousand years of Hungary, offered the perfect excuse for large-scale projects such as the Parliament, Vajdahunyad Castle, or the Grand Boulevard (Nagyk\u00f6r\u00fat) the first electric underground railway in the world (now Metro yellow line). Budapest was transformed to a world city during these decades, enriched by Austrian, Jewish, Slovakian, Serbian, Croatian, Roma and other cultural influence. This age is remembered as the 'Monarchia' (or as 'K. u. K.', abbreviation for Imperial-Royal in Austria and other parts of the Empire) and associated with the rule of Franz Joseph I. (I. Ferenc J\u00f3zsef) who died in 1916 after 68 years on the throne.\nIn this period, the city was the home of two world-famous Hungarian inventors -- the father of the electric locomotive, K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Kand\u00f3, and inventor of the match, J\u00e1nos Irinyi -- and of two renowned composers, B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k and Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly. There is no other European city which had given so many Hollywood filmmakers in the early 20th century, such as Budapest.\n\n\n==== The world wars ====\nNeither the Habsburg empire nor Hungary survived World War I in their previous form - leaving Budapest as the capital of a now independent Hungary which lost two thirds of its territory, most of its non-Magyar population, and a few million Hungarian speakers, to neighbouring countries. The city's population reached one million around 1930. During the interwar years under the rule of regent Mikl\u00f3s Horthy, a former Admiral of the Austro-Hungarian fleet, Hungary became an ally of Germany. Near the end of World War II, Nazi Germany occupied Hungary after it attempted to negotiate separate peace with the Allies, and eventually installed a bloody dictatorship putting the hitherto fairly unimportant Nazi Nyilaskeresztes (Arrowcross) party in charge. While practically all of the 400,000 Jews in the countryside were murdered by German Nazis and their Hungarian nyilas sympathizers, roughly 60% of Budapest's Jewish community was saved during the Holocaust. People who are remembered for helping the local Jewish community include Raoul Wallenberg, the famous Swedish diplomat, who organised the distribution of Swedish passports by his embassy to as many Jews as possible, and the Italian Giorgio Perlasca, who \u2013 pretending to be a Spanish diplomat \u2013 rescued many thousands of Jews, but there were many other foreigners and Hungarians who participated in this effort. Air raids and a terrible three-month siege towards the end of World War II resulted in the death of over 38,000 civilians and the destruction of much of the once so lively city.\n\n\n==== From communism to contemporary times ====\nAfter the war, Budapest slowly recovered and became a showcase for the more pragmatic policies of Hungary's hard-line Communist government under the dictatorial rule of M\u00e1ty\u00e1s R\u00e1kosi. The city was, however, also the main site of the 1956 uprising which was successful in installing a reform-oriented (albeit communist) government of Imre Nagy. This was swept away before long, after the Soviet leader Khrushchev decided to send in the tanks feeling that Hungary was slipping away from under Moscow's control. The Soviets installed J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r as the leader of the communist state who, after over thirty years of controversial rule, was voted out of leadership 1988 by the central committee due to health issues, and died in 1989.\nSince the peaceful 1989 'system change' (Rendszerv\u00e1lt\u00e1s) which was achieved as a compromise between reformist party forces and the opposition (notably including a younger self of the current prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n), Budapest transformed in appearance and atmosphere, a process further accelerated by the country's long-awaited joining with the European Union in 2004.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nWinter (November until early March) can be cold and there is little sunshine. Snowfall is fairly frequent in most years, and nighttime temperatures of \u221215\u00b0C (5\u00b0F) are not uncommon between mid-December and mid-February.\nThe spring months (March and April) see variable conditions, with a rapid increase in the average temperature. The weather in late March and April is often very agreeable during the day and fresh at night.\nBudapest's long summer - lasting from May until mid-September - is warm or very warm. Budapest has as much summer sunshine as many Mediterranean resorts. Sudden heavy showers also occur, particularly in May and June.\nThe autumn (mid-September until late October) is perhaps the best season for tourists as it has little rain and long sunny days with moderate temperatures. At the end of October the weather often turns abruptly colder.\n\n\n=== Quality of life ===\nFor those with a reasonable budget, Budapest offers a rather high quality of life. In terms of culture, cuisine and general 'vibe', Budapest is comparable to other major European cities (see dedicated sections), while prices are lower.\nIt's just as well that prices are lower because local pay is significantly lower than in western Europe (for example, a skilled worker earns a minimum of 161,250 Hungarian forint (Ft) per month in 2017 before tax, while unskilled labourers earn a minimum wage of Ft127,650 per month.\nThere is a rise in the number of homeless people seen in metro stations doorways in Buda and in Pest. While this does trouble locals who often grew up without seeing explicit homelessness (before 1989), this issue usually does not present a safety risk to travellers.\n\n\n=== Official tourist information ===\n1 Tourism Office of Budapest, 1115 Budapest, Bart\u00f3k B\u00e9la \u00fat 105-113 ( : 'M\u00f3ricz Zsigmond k\u00f6rt\u00e9r' further Tram 19, 49 to 'Karolina \u00fat'), \u260f +36 1 438-8080. You can get some very good free items, including a map of Budapest, a map of Hungary with all the youth hostels and prices and a very complete brochure about the northern part of Hungary (available in many languages). \n2 Tourinform Call Center, S\u00fct\u0151 utca 2 (De\u00e1k Ferenc t\u00e9r) (   : De\u00e1k Ferenc t\u00e9r), \u260f +36 1 438-8080, toll-free: +800 36 000 000, info@hungarytourism.hu. M-F 08:00-20:00. Can help with local information, accommodation, and free brochures, maps, postcards, and souvenirs. \n3 Tourist Information Centre, Buda Castle (Szenth\u00e1roms\u00e1g t\u00e9r), I. district, T\u00e1rnok u. 15 (From    : De\u00e1k Ferenc t\u00e9r or  : Sz\u00e9ll K\u00e1lm\u00e1n t\u00e9r take Bus 16 to D\u00edsz t\u00e9r). Daily 09:00-18:00. This information point stocks a comprehensive range of free leaflets, maps and listings magazines and free guidebooks which offer lots of ideas about sights and sounds, gastronomy, shopping, by night and lifestyle. You can also book shows, concerts and sightseeing tickets. \n4 Tourist Information Centre \u2013 City Park, XIV. district, Olof Palme s\u00e9t\u00e1ny 5 (Ice Rink -  : 'H\u0151s\u00f6k tere'). M-Th 10:00\u201318:00, F Sa 10:00\u201320:00 (09:00\u201318:00/20:00 spring and summer time). The office is an attraction in itself, as it is in a very nice location, with a beautiful view from the window. In summer you can see a little lake with people boating, and in winter, the lake is frozen and used for ice skating. You can book shows, concerts and sightseeing tickets and get information about city parks, free maps and free guide books. \n\n\n== Get in ==\n\n\n=== By plane ===\nThe Budapest International Airport serves the city. If no flight is suitable, you can check flights to Vienna, Zagreb, Debrecen or Bratislava and arrange to take a train or bus to Budapest.\n\n1 Budapest Franz Liszt International Airport (BUD  IATA Budapest Liszt Ferenc Nemzetk\u00f6zi Rep\u00fcl\u0151t\u00e9r pronounced \"list-ferents\", often still called by its old name Ferihegy) (It's located about 16 km (9.9 mi) south-east of the city centre). Hungary's chief airport.   \nDestinations: Budapest has direct flights to most major European cities. Many of these are operated by the budget carrier WizzAir, which is based here and is now in effect Hungary's national airline. Other budget operators include Easyjet, Ryanair, Jet2, Norwegian and Vueling. This competition holds down prices on the traditional airlines such as KLM and Lufthansa.\nDirect destinations around the fringes of Europe include Reykjavik, St Petersburg, Moscow, Kyiv, Kutaisi, Baku, Astana, Tel Aviv and Agadir. Gulf carriers connect via Doha and Dubai to the Far East, Australasia and Africa. There are no direct flights between Budapest and North America: connect via London, Amsterdam or Paris.\n\nAt the airport: the central information number is +36 1 296-9696 or +36 1 296-7000. Luggage services can be contacted on +36 1 296-5965.\nAll flights use Terminals 2A and 2B. Terminal 1 closed in 2011 when the flag-carrier Mal\u00e9v Hungarian Airlines folded.\nThere's no practical distinction between Terminals 2A and 2B, and they're freely connected landside by corridors and airside by \"SkyCourt\" food & retail area. (Originally 2A served Schengen Area destinations, and 2B the rest of the world, but this has been dropped.) Check-in and bag-drop desks 1-30 are in Hall 2A and desks 31-60 in Hall 2B, but do not correspond to the gates. This means that if 2A has a long line for security, you can get airside through 2B (and vice versa), as both lead into the SkyCourt.\nThere are several small cafes in Skycourt and in 2A & 2B near the gates. Duty-free stores are operated by Heinemann. They're seldom a bargain - by all means blow away your last local currency here. But if you're looking for something in particular (eg Tokay wine), check prices in advance on their website and compare with downtown supermarket prices. You can usually only buy duty-free if you're taking a direct flight: if you're transiting another European airport, security there will confiscate liquids.\n\nGetting between airport and city: the main options are bus, bus & metro, bus & train, and taxi / transfer.\n\nBus line 100E Airport Express\nThis runs from city centre to Airport Terminal 2 every 10 minutes during the day, every 20 minutes early morning and late night, taking 30-40 minutes. The city centre bus stop is by De\u00e1k t\u00e9r at K\u00e1roly krt in front of V\u00e1rosh\u00e1za Park; look for a blue articulated bus with an airplane sign. The only stop on the way is called \"K\u00e1lvin t\u00e9r\", but it's around the corner into the top of \u00dcll\u0151i \u00fat. The airport bus stop is just outside Terminal 2 Arrivals. The bus runs every day, outbound 03:40-00:40, city-bound 05:00-01:20. The fare is Ft2200; you're encouraged to buy tickets from vending machines or at customer service kiosks, but the driver will issue tickets and give change. Be careful not to buy the 450Ft tickets, these are not valid and if you stamp them in the bus, they will be wasted.\nMetro  + Bus line 200E\nBus line 200E runs between Terminal 2 and K\u0151b\u00e1nya-Kispest Metro station, taking 25 min, bus fare Ft450. You there buy a Metro ticket for another Ft450 and ride line 3 to the city centre, about 20 mins to the main interchange at De\u00e1k Ferenc t\u00e9r. The bus runs all day every day, with 7-8 minutes frequency during the day, 30-60 minutes at late night. The metro runs every 3-5 mins, 04:30-00:00. If the connections are slick, this route takes 45 minutes.\nTrain + Bus line 200E\nK\u0151b\u00e1nya-Kispest also has a mainline train station, with trains every 10-15 min to Budapest Nyugati in the northern city centre taking about 25 min. More likely you'd change here to reach eastern towns such as Szeged, Kecskem\u00e9t, Debrecen, Miskolc for, and Szolnok where you can change again for trains into Romania. Do not board a train for Budapest Keleti: it will make a grand 6-hour scenic tour of the countryside before looping back to the city. Reach K\u0151b\u00e1nya-Kispest from the airport on Bus 200E as described above.On the way, the bus runs past Ferihegy station, which used to serve the former airport Terminal 1. Trains do stop here but the place is dismal and dilapidated, you won't feel safe, and the ticket machine has probably been vandalised. Stay on the bus for another 5 min unless you're frantic to catch a last train.\nTaxi: the only licensed taxi operator at the airport is F\u0151taxi - don't accept offers from drivers or touts waiting around Arrivals. However, you can order via phone/app a taxi to the terminal from other company, too. A trip inbound to central Budapest will cost from Ft13000. Queue at the taxi stand first to receive a written quote for your fare, then pay it when you arrive at your destination. Pre-ordering by phone may get you a better price.\nNote that F\u0151taxi does not provide child seats of any kind, whereas MiniSud shared shuttle does.\n\nShared Transfer: the official shared shuttle for the airport is MiniBud. From a central hotel fares would be around Ft8990 single, Ft15990 return for one person, plus Ft2000 per extra person. Check prices and make reservations on the company's website.\nPrivate Transfer: to and from the city of Budapest and all location in Hungary by Airport Transfer Budapest . One to three people will cost Ft13500 oneway, Ft26400 return per estate car. Four to seven people will cost Ft21000 oneway, Ft41000 return per minibus. Total vehicle prices, without sharing the car with strangers. Pay the driver in cash or card. Online booking is possible up to 21 people, beyond that contact them for a quote.\n\n\n=== By train ===\n\nDirect trains connect Budapest with 11 countries. You can plan international and domestic trips and buy tickets on jegy.mav.hu (Note that the site doesn't include services by all private operators, ex. RegioJet.)\n\nBerlin: one direct train (11 hr) from Budapest Nyugati via Brno, Prague and Dresden, continuing to Hamburg. Several indirect services from Nyugati or Keleti take 12-15 hours, usually changing in Prague.\nMunich: five direct trains (7 hr) from Budapest Keleti via Vienna, Linz and Salzburg; indirect services changing in those cities.\nVienna: direct trains every 1-2 hours (2:37 hr) from Budapest Keleti. Also several from Budapest D\u00e9li changing at Gy\u00f6r. Change in Vienna for Venice. There is also a daily first-class \u00d6BB-UZ sleeper through-car (147/749) to Vienna coming from Kyiv via Budapest Kelenfold and Budapest Keleti, but may be quite expensive.\nGraz: one direct train (6 hr) from Budapest D\u00e9li, otherwise change in Vienna.\nZ\u00fcrich: one direct train (11 hr) from Budapest Keleti, otherwise change in Vienna.\nPrague: five direct daytime trains (6\u00bd hr) from Budapest Nyugati via Bratislava, B\u0159eclav and Brno, plus one overnight train (10 hr) from Keleti.\nBratislava: nine direct trains (2\u00bd hr) from Budapest Nyugati, departing every 2 hr. As of September 2024, a Bratislava\u2013Budapest ticket costs \u20ac17.80\nKo\u0161ice: seven direct trains (3\u00bd hr) from Budapest Keleti.\nWarsaw: one direct daytime train (10 hr) from Budapest Nyugati and one overnight train (13 hr) from Keleti.\nBucharest: two overnight trains (16 hr) from Budapest Keleti via Arad, Deva, Sibiu and Brasov in Transylvania. Daytime connections are via Timisoara. Bucharest is nowadays the best route for Istanbul.\nLjubljana: one direct train (8 hr) from Budapest D\u00e9li, otherwise change in Zagreb or Salzburg.\nZagreb: two direct trains (6 hr) from Budapest D\u00e9li, otherwise change at Zidani Most. Change in Zagreb for Split.\nBelgrade: this line is closed until 2025 because of engineering work in Serbia. Normally there are two direct daytime trains and one overnight (8\u00bd hr) from Budapest Keleti via Novi Sad. Change in Belgrade (spelt \"Beograd\" on DB) for Sarajevo, Podgorica and Bar. This is also the usual route for Sofia and Istanbul, but it's slow and with unreliable connections.\nLviv: one direct train (14 hr) from Budapest Nyugati via Debrecen and Chop. Other indirect services from Keleti or Nyugati. Change at Lviv for Kyiv and Odesa. This is probably also the simplest route to Moscow, but look for other means of transport. There is also a daily first-class \u00d6BB-UZ sleeper through-car (147/749) to Kyiv coming from Vienna via Budapest Kelenfold and Budapest Keleti via Chop, but may be quite expensive.\n\n\n==== Railway stations ====\n\nStations in Budapest, as elsewhere in Hungary, are frankly a bit rough. The fabric of the buildings is in poor repair, stations and trains are hard to access for people with disabilities, and passenger facilities are very limited. Do not expect luggage trolleys or clean toilets. English is rarely spoken by staff except at international cash desks. If you haven't pre-booked online, be prepared for long queues at the ticket office. Hazards include bad exchange rates, predatory taxi drivers, aggressive drunks, and pickpockets.\nThere are three large terminus stations for long-distance trains: Nyugati (west), Keleti (east) & D\u00e9li (south). These are surrounded by decent cafes, fast food places, and other facilities.\n\n2 Nyugati p\u00e1lyaudvar (Western Railway Station), Nyugati t\u00e9r ( : Nyugati p\u00e1lyaudvar; bus 9, 26, 91, 191, 226, 291; tram 4, 6; trolley: 72, 73; night bus: 914, 914A, 923, 931, 934, 950, 950A).

(updated Jun 2024)\n\n\n== Get around ==\n\n\n=== Orientation ===\n\nOrientation is not a big problem in Budapest. The river Danube splits the city into two areas: Buda and Pest. Aside from the very centre, the city's structure is quite logical. Landmarks in Buda as the Royal Castle or Citadella Castle also help you to find your way. Besides the Danube, the best reference points for orienting yourself are the bridges crossing the river. From north to south, they are:\n\n5 Megyeri Bridge (Megyeri h\u00edd) (At northern city border). The newest one. A cable-stayed bridge. Built in 2008. There are 4 lanes and 2 hard shoulders. Part of the M0 motorway.   \n6 \u00c1rp\u00e1d Bridge (\u00c1rp\u00e1d h\u00edd). A modern bridge linking to Northern Margaret Island. The longest bridge in Budapest at 973 m. Also the busiest bridge in Budapest.   \n7 Margaret Bridge (Margit h\u00edd). Easily identified thanks to its distinctive shape: it makes an approximately 35 degree turn half-way across, at the southern tip of Margaret Island. Trams 4 and 6 cross the Danube here. Close to its on the Buda side is the northernmost destination of the Muslim pilgrims: the Tomb of G\u00fcl baba.   \n8 Chain Bridge (Sz\u00e9chenyi l\u00e1nch\u00edd). Completed in 1849, this is the oldest permanent bridge over the Danube. It\u2019s also the least busy bridge in Budapest, since it\u2019s not connected to any main roads arguably most beautiful and certainly the most photographed of Budapest's bridges, floodlit at night. The bridge is closed to pedestrians for reconstruction until 2023.   \n9 Elisabeth Bridge (Erzs\u00e9bet h\u00edd). Completed in 1903. Its original chain structure was destroyed in World War II, and was substituted by a modern cable bridge which opened in 1964. The narrowest facade's building of Budapest is 6.2 wide. It is on the Buda side of the Elizabeth Bridge and can easily be spotted while crossing the Danube from Pest.   \n10 Liberty Bridge (Szabads\u00e1g h\u00edd). Elegant and complex, opened in 1896; it connects the Gell\u00e9rt Baths (Gell\u00e9rt f\u00fcrd\u0151) in Buda with the Central Market Hall (Nagy V\u00e1s\u00e1rcsarnok) in Pest.   \n11 Pet\u0151fi Bridge (Pet\u0151fi h\u00edd). For a long time the southernmost bridge, it links the inner ring road (Nagyk\u00f6r\u00fat) of Pest with Buda.   \n12 R\u00e1k\u00f3czi Bridge (R\u00e1k\u00f3czi h\u00edd). The second newest bridge in Budapest, with modern architecture and a spectacular lighting system where mirrors reflect the beam of the upward facing floodlights. Built very next to a railway bridge on its southern side. It was called L\u00e1gym\u00e1nyosi h\u00edd before 2011.   \n\n\n=== On foot ===\nMany of Budapest's highlights are easy to approach walking, and in the centre you find more pedestrian zones from year to year. Car drivers tend to respect pedestrians and often give advantage on a cross-walk even if there is no traffic light. Due to the lack of bike lanes, cyclists have to weave around pedestrian traffic; be prepared. Don't wear high-heeled shoes in the centre as there are lots of stone pavements, especially in the Castle Hill.\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\nYou'll find several points of interest within walking distance, but Budapest is a sizeable city, so unless you drive your own car (or bicycle), you will inevitably use some form of public transport. The good news is that the urban area is well covered by four metro lines, blue urban buses, yellow trams and red trolley-buses, and the whole system is fairly easy to understand. On the other hand, schedules are not quite as reliable as in, say, Vienna, vehicles are not always the cleanest, and tickets have become increasingly expensive.\nAll people aged 65 or older can travel free. ID card or passport is sufficient to justify your age. Children under 14 years of age can also travel free on Budapest public transport.\nPublic transportation in Budapest is run by Centre for Budapest Transport (BKK), which has some useful English-language pages on their site including current schedules and fares. Vehicles run from around 05:00 to 23:30 (or, on Christmas Eve, to 16:00). After that an extensive night bus network is available.\nYou can use the BudapestGO (iOS, Android) mobile app to plan journeys, buy tickets and passes and get updates on distruptions. You can also plan journeys from the web version.\nConnections are shown on Google Maps, Transitious and CityMapper as well.\nIf you only visit Budapest for a few days as a tourist, you may find the following lines particularly useful:\n\n    Metro 1, 2, 3, 4 connect the suburbs with the biggest transport hubs, numerous tourist highlights and central hotels. The metro network is rather simple, there are no splits or merges of lines, no shortened routes in normal operation.\nTram 2, 2B, 23 runs along the river Danube on Pest side.\nTrams 4, 6 follow Nagyk\u00f6r\u00fat (Grand Boulevard) offering service up to every 3 minutes at peak times.\nTrams 19, 41 along the Danube on the Buda side.\nBus 7, 8E, 107, 108E and 133E connect Keleti railway station with the city center and many points of interest in Buda and Pest.\nBus 16, 16A, 116 and 216 go to Buda castle.\nBus 105, 210, 210B connect H\u0151s\u00f6k tere (Hero's Square), goes up and down Andr\u00e1ssy avenue to De\u00e1k square/Erzs\u00e9bet square before it goes across the Chain Bridge to Buda.\nBus lines 100E and 200E serve the airport. Special fare applies on 100E.\nPublic transport maps are displayed in all metro stations, city centre tram stops and underpasses. \n\n\n==== Tickets and passes ====\nIf you intend to travel a lot, and you probably will, travel cards are far less expensive than single tickets. As of September 2023 most useful tickets and travel cards for tourists include the following:\n\nSingle tickets (Vonaljegy t\u00edpus\u00fa jegyek): Valid for one journey within the city limits, transfer not allowed on buses and trams, but one transfer is allowed between metro lines ). Ft450, Ft600 if purchased from the driver (available on designated lines). The ticket must be validated before each ride.\nBlock of 10 tickets (10 db-os gy\u0171jt\u0151jegy): Ft4,000 (10 tickets for the price of 8.9)\nMonthly passes (Havi b\u00e9rletek)\nMonthly Budapest-pass (havi Budapest-b\u00e9rlet): Valid for 30 or 31 consecutive days. Valid also on M\u00c1V trains and suburban yellow Vol\u00e1n buses. Ft8,950 (Ft298 per day)\nMonthly Budapest pass for students: Valid for 30 consecutive days, with a student ID, 3,450 Ft. You need a valid student ID (Hungarian or from a country in the EU, EEA or from Switzerland)).\n15-day Budapest pass (f\u00e9lhavi Budapest-b\u00e9rlet): Valid for 15 consecutive days. Valid also on M\u00c1V trains and suburban yellow Vol\u00e1n buses Ft5,950 (Ft397 per day)\nTime-based tickets (Id\u0151alap\u00fa jegyek): Available only with mobile ticket. Unlimited number of transfers within the time limit, within the city limits. 30 minutes: 530 Ft, 90 minutes: 750 Ft. The last travel can be finished after the time limit is over. Validate the ticket each time you board.\nTravelcards (Napijegy t\u00edpus\u00fa jegyek):\n24-hour travel card (Budapest 24 \u00f3r\u00e1s jegy): Valid for 24 hours after purchase 2,500 Ft, or 5,000 Ft for 2-5 people travelling together.\n72-hour travel card (Budapest 72 \u00f3r\u00e1s jegy): Valid for 72 hours after purchase Ft5,500 (Ft1,833 per day).\nBudapest Card (Budapest k\u00e1rtya): allows you unlimited free travel in the city, and also gives you discounts at museums and restaurants. There are available cards for 24h, 48h or 72h. All of them are valid from the first use and free for a child under 6 years (with a cardholder). Every card give free entrance to the Budapest Zoo and valid for 2 walking tours in Buda and Pest. One-day card 14,990 Ft, Two-day card 19,990 Ft (Hop on Hop off bus and boat included), three-day card 25.990 Ft. While it's advertised extensively and on sale at virtually every location that tourist go to, it may not be worthwhile to purchase this pass because many popular attractions only offer discount, not free entry, for pass holders. You will need to visit multiple museums and ride on public transit multiple times a day just to break even.\nAnnual Passes (\u00c9ves b\u00e9rletek)\nQuarterly passes (Negyed\u00e9ves b\u00e9rletek)\nSemester passes (Szemeszterre sz\u00f3l\u00f3 b\u00e9rletek)\nFerry tickets (R\u00e9vjegyek): valid for a single trip on ferry line D14. 170 Ft (110 Ft for pupils under 15 and pensioners with pensioner certificate)\nHungary Pass, Hungary24: also valid for local (BKK) services. At 18900HUF and 4999HUF, buying these mostly makes sense if you plan to visit more regions outside Budapest.\nTo have a care-free trip throughout Budapest, always have a public transport ticket, pass or a Budapest Card, when using this service. The fine is 25,000 Ft, or 12,000 Ft if paid on the spot. You may run into ticket inspectors, especially in trams and buses on Sunday, but mostly they are busy guarding the entrance and exit to some of the metro stations. They hardly speak English and some were reported to be extremely keen on checking tourists. Ticket control inspectors can ask for your ID, however they are indeed not considered police officers under Hungarian law.\n\n\n==== Metro ====\n\nBudapest's underground network is an excellent way to get around, it connects the suburbs with railway and autobus stations, several centrally located hotels, museums and sights. The system consists of four lines. Line 1, 2 and 3 cross at De\u00e1k t\u00e9r station (De\u00e1k square, in Pest centre), while Line 2 and 4 cross at Keleti p\u00e1lyaudvar (Eastern Railway Station) and Line 3 and 4 cross at K\u00e1lvin t\u00e9r (K\u00e1lvin square). Metro lines are well represented on maps scattered on platforms.\nUsually ticket inspectors guard the entrances of the downward-moving escalators and they only let those passengers move further who show them their validated tickets or passes. Passengers pass by the ticket validation machines before they reach the guards and the downward-moving escalators. It is best to purchase a discount booklet of 10 tickets. Do not separate the tickets and punch one ticket prior to each boarding of a subway train.\n\n  Metro 1 (yellow line) connects Mexik\u00f3i \u00fat (Mexik\u00f3i road, a transport hub in Central-Northeast Budapest) with V\u00f6r\u00f6smarty t\u00e9r (V\u00f6r\u00f6smarty square in Pest's commercial and touristy centre), and also passes the Opera and H\u0151s\u00f6k tere (Heroes' square). It was built to commemorate the 1000th year of Hungarian nationhood in 1896 (thus often called Millennium Subway). It was the first underground built in Continental Europe and second in the world after London. Although the vehicles are not original, the beautifully rebuilt, tile covered stations are a gorgeous historical memory of Budapest's richest period (1880\u20131910).\n  Metro 2 (red line) connects D\u00e9li p\u00e1lyaudvar (Southern Railway Station, in Central Buda) with \u00d6rs vez\u00e9r tere (\u00d6rs vez\u00e9r square, the biggest transport hub of Eastern Pest), and also takes you to Sz\u00e9ll K\u00e1lm\u00e1n t\u00e9r (former Moszkva t\u00e9r, Buda's biggest transport hub), Kossuth t\u00e9r (Kossuth square, around the Parliament in Pest centre) and Keleti p\u00e1lyaudvar (Keleti Railway Station, in Pest). Although the construction started in the 1950s, the line was opened between 1970 and 1972. Having been completely rebuilt since 2004, its stations seem brand new, and the old Soviet trains have been replaced by modern Alstom Metropolis ones.\n  Metro 3 (blue line) goes from \u00dajpest-K\u00f6zpont (residential area in Pest's Northern suburbs) to K\u0151b\u00e1nya-Kispest (transport hub in Central-Eastern Pest, terminus of bus 200E to the airport), passing Nyugati p\u00e1lyaudvar (Western Railway Station) and different stations in central Pest. Opened between 1976 and 1990.\n  Metro 4 (green line) connects Kelenf\u00f6ld vas\u00fat\u00e1llom\u00e1s (Kelenf\u00f6ld Railway Station, transport hub in Central-Southern Buda) with Keleti p\u00e1lyaudvar (Eastern Railway Station, transport hub in central Pest). It has stations at \u00dajbuda-K\u00f6zpont (\u00dajbuda-Center, where Allee Shopping Mall is located), Szent Gell\u00e9rt t\u00e9r (Saint Gell\u00e9rt square, site of Gell\u00e9rt Hill, Gell\u00e9rt Spa and Danubius Gell\u00e9rt Hotel) and F\u0151v\u00e1m T\u00e9r (F\u0151v\u00e1m square, site of the V\u00e1s\u00e1rcsarnok (Central Market Hall) and the southern end of V\u00e1ci street). The line was built between 2006 and 2014, the result is state-of-the-art stations and trains, and uses automatic train operation.\n\n\n==== Tram ====\n\nBudapest's 35 tram lines are a tourist-friendly way of getting around. They are slower, but more scenic than the metro and particularly useful on the nearly metro-less Buda side of the river. Be careful with doors, they open on different side of the tram on different stops.\nParticularly useful lines for tourists are:\n\nTram 4 and 6 run along Nagyk\u00f6r\u00fat, Pest's inner ring road, providing access to all four metro lines at multiple stations, and crossing over to north Buda (Hegyvid\u00e9k and \u00d3buda) on Margaret Bridge (Margit h\u00edd) and south Buda (South Buda) on Pet\u0151fi Bridge \u2013 another beautiful view. Lines 4 and 6 only diverge for their last two stops that the tourists are unlikely to visit.\nTwo lines running along the Danube river\n19 / 41 in Buda passing V\u00edziv\u00e1ros and South Buda\n2, 2B and 23 in Pest passing Belv\u00e1ros.\nAll these are considered a part of the cityscape. Both offer beautiful view of the opposite side.\n\n\n==== Bus ====\n\nBudapest has a dense bus network, which also connects the agglomeration and suburban zones with several metro and train stations and the city center. The numbering system is easy to understand. Numbers below 299 indicate regular bus routes. Numbers with an added 'E' (for example 7E) indicate express services that don't stop at all stops (however, lines without the letter 'E' may not stop at all stops either). Numbers with an added 'A' have shorter routes than their regular counterparts (for example bus 30 has a longer itinerary than 30A). Numbers above 900 indicate night services.\n(Numbers between 300 and 899 are suburban services provided by Vol\u00e1nbusz. BKK tickets and most tourist passes are not valid on them, but daily, weekly and monthly travel cards are.)\nParticularly useful lines for tourists include:\n\nBus 7, 8E, 107, 108E, 133E \u2013 all connect Keleti railway station with Blaha Lujza square (Blaha Lujza t\u00e9r, junction with tram 4, 6), Pest city center and many points of interest in Buda.

Unless you are a trolley buff, you're unlikely to use them frequently. However, some of them pass through the City Park (V\u00e1rosliget) and cross Andr\u00e1ssy avenue (Andr\u00e1ssy \u00fat), giving you beautiful views while using this eco-friendly mode of transport. Line 70 from Kossuth square (Kossuth t\u00e9r, next to the Parliament) to City Park (V\u00e1rosliget) also passes through the lively Nagymez\u0151 utca, Budapest's \"Broadway\".\n\n\n==== Suburban rail ====\nGreen suburban railway lines (called h\u00e9v) connect central Budapest with several suburbs, but most of them are of little use to visitors. Your tickets and travel passes are valid only within the city boundaries, otherwise you should purchase a supplementary ticket (kieg\u00e9sz\u00edt\u0151 jegy) at a ticket office.\n\n  H5 (Batthy\u00e1ny t\u00e9r\u2013Szentendre), Batthy\u00e1ny t\u00e9r uderpass (It connects at Batthy\u00e1ny t\u00e9r with metro 2, at Margit h\u00edd (Margaret bridge) with tram 4/6.).

A single ticket/pass plus need an (extra) Metropolitan area single ticket, Price: Ft560 or buy a full ticket at cash desk Ft900.  \n H9 (branch of H8)\n\n\n==== Other ====\n\nSome other means of public transport can be useful if you get tired of regular buses and trams, or if you want to escape from the hustle and bustle to the lush green hills surrounding Budapest.\n\n13 Tram 60 (Cogwheel railway) (Fogaskerek\u0171 vas\u00fat). A tram-like railway with historic charm, running from V\u00e1rosmajor terminus (two stops from Sz\u00e9ll K\u00e1lm\u00e1n t\u00e9r   station by tram 59 or 61) climbing Sz\u00e9chenyi hill (Sz\u00e9chenyi hegy), Buda's popular picnic, excursion and sledging place. BKK tickets and passes are valid.   \n14 Boat, Vigad\u00f3 Square. Mahart Passnave (and other companies) offer boat tours in and around Budapest. Most services run at reduced frequency (or not at all) in the winter off-season. (updated Apr 2023)\n15 Buda Castle funicular (Budav\u00e1ri sikl\u00f3), Clark \u00c1d\u00e1m t\u00e9r (Take bus No.16, 105, 210, 210B or 216 from   De\u00e1k Ferenc t\u00e9r). Daily 07:30-22:00.

BKK tickets and passes are not valid.  \n\n\n==== Night services ====\nBudapest is covered by 43 night bus lines and tram 6 operating non-stop. Numbers are triple-digit, starting with '9'. Buses run every 15\u201360 minutes from around 23:00-04:00. The main linking points of the night bus network are Sz\u00e9ll K\u00e1lm\u00e1n t\u00e9r (former Moszkva t\u00e9r) in Buda and Astoria (junction of Kossuth Lajos utca\u2013K\u00e1roly k\u00f6r\u00fat) in Pest. Daytime tickets and passes are valid.\nMost useful night routes are:\n\nTram 6 \u2013 Running along the Nagyk\u00f6r\u00fat, Pest's inner ring road, every 10\u201315 minutes at night, usually very packed.\nBuses 907, 973, 973A \u2013 Substitute buses 7 at night\nBus 979, 979A \u2013 Runs on Andr\u00e1ssy \u00fat as metro line M1 does during the day\nBus 956 \u2013 Covers most of the route of metro line M2\nBuses 914, 914A, 950, 950A \u2013 Cover the route of metro line M3\nOn-line maps and schedules are available on BKK's home page. Real time traffic updates are posted on BKK Info   There are a few Android/IOS apps for timetables, search for the word \"bkk\". BpMenetrend is one of them: Android , iOS .\nMost night buses require boarding through the front door. Security guards or the driver inspects the tickets or passes prior to boarding.\n\n\n=== By car ===\nApart from the summer holiday, Budapest has heavy traffic with long-lasting traffic jams in the morning and in the afternoon. If you don't want to spend your visit to Budapest in a traffic jam, leave your car in the hotel's garage, and use the public transport.\nIf you drive across city centre, plan your journey, otherwise you can get into tough situations. For example you cannot turn left in most of the crossings of the inner ring road (Nagyk\u00f6r\u00fat) or on the main avenues like Andr\u00e1ssy \u00fat, V\u00e1ci \u00fat, \u00dcll\u0151i \u00fat or R\u00e1k\u00f3czi \u00fat.\n\n\n=== By taxi ===\nBudapest's taxi drivers mostly are not fluent in English or any other foreign language, but it does not necessarily mean that they intend to overcharge their foreigner guests. Use one of the major taxi companies with English speaking switchboards to avoid problems. Most companies' websites now have pages in English.\nDo not accept offers from taxi drivers waiting in the airport terminals or railway stations. Use your common sense, sit only in taxis logoed by bigger companies.\nIf possible, as stupid as it may sound, try to pick a taxi with the meter in a place where the driver can't fiddle with it while driving. While the fare per kilometre stays the same, apparently it's possible to \"bump\" the price by adding extra basic fees.\nMost taxis parked in the central areas do not belong to radio taxi companies and charge much more than the usual Ft1100 main price, Ft110 per minute and Ft440 per km price. Ask about their price in advance or call any of the taxi companies above.\nAfter dark it is often best to negotiate the fare at the beginning of the ride as drivers often charge exorbitant rates to unwary travellers. Be sure to make sure your change is in Hungarian forint or euros and not in another country's currency. Most taxi drivers only take cash payments but some of the larger taxi companies now equip their cars with POS terminals (allowing you to pay by plastic).\nBe very careful when taking taxis to or from nightclubs. There are multiple reports of drivers taking passengers to a different location (one that pays them a commission) and charging a fare up to 10 times the normal amount.\nIf you would prefer a luxury taxi, like a Mercedes, they can usually be found at the upmarket hotels. Fares, of course, are higher in these cars but the drivers are more reputable and more likely to speak English or German.\nCalling your own taxi will be less expensive than having one booked for you in a hotel; it's also almost always cheaper to call a taxi than to enter a waiting one or to signal one that drives by you.\nRide-hailing is available in Budapest:\n\n Bolt. (updated Jul 2020)\n\n\n=== By bicycle ===\n\nBudapest may be one of the most exciting places of Europe, but it's still not a cyclists' paradise. Generally, the city is not prepared for cyclists' presence, although the situation is slowly changing. Budapest has been home to Europe's biggest cycling demonstration, Critical Mass, where in 2008 more than 80,000 people participated. Bike delivery is becoming a common job (you'll see NetPinc\u00e9r and Wolt cyclists everywhere), and there are more than a few gem bike paths, along either side of the Danube river traversing all the way to Szentendre on the Buda side.\nBike lanes of varying quality exist but are not universal and don't form a good network. In many places, the bike lane is a part of the pavement, with only a yellow line separating it from the pedestrian zone; in some places (e.g. on the upper quay on the Buda side of the Danube, between the Chain bridge and the Elisabeth bridge) the bike lane and the pedestrian pavement even swap sides with no warning.\nIn the city centre (e.g. Andr\u00e1ssy \u00fat), expect cars parking on bike lanes, and drivers opening car doors recklessly; on pavements, expect pedestrians wandering into the bike lane.\nMany native cyclists regard cycling not as a means of transportation but a form of extreme sport. You can see them zigzagging between pedestrians in bike lanes, ignoring red lights (but, thankfully, not traffic), cycling along one-way streets in the wrong direction, alternating between using the road and the pavement where no cycle lane exists, at speeds of more than 30 km/h (20 mph). Quite a few cyclists don't have any lights; when cycling after dark, be prepared for surprise encounters.\nIf, while walking, you hear a shout, be prepared to get out of the way quickly. Many cycles don't have bells, and pedestrians are not used to bells either; if you're cycling, expect many pedestrians to ignore your bell. Also, beware of pedestrians wandering onto marked bicycle paths, especially in areas with heavy pedestrian traffic.\nLarge parks like the V\u00e1rosliget, the Margaret island and the Haj\u00f3gy\u00e1ri (a.k.a. \u00d3budai) island are pleasant for cycling.\nCycling is forbidden on the lower quays on both sides, but the upper quays mostly have bike lanes; however, in many parts pedestrian traffic is so high that cyclists can't make good speed.\nCycling is typically forbidden on most hiking trails of the Buda hills, but mountain bikers tend to ignore this.\nIf you think you are ready, renting a bike is easy but not cheap. Expect to pay Ft2000-3000 for a day.\nBudapest has a number of bike rental companies. Some of them are:\n\nBudapest Bike , +36 30 944-5533. Rent a bike starting at Ft2000 for 6 hours.\n Yellow Zebra Bike, R\u00e9gi posta utca 2, Budapest 1052, \u260f +36 70 56 56 115. Daily 09:00-21:00. Bike range from 3-speed cruisers to trekking and road bikes (at higher prices). (updated Jan 2024)\nBikebase, +36 1 269-5983. Bike rentals available for Ft2,000 for 24 hours.\nDynamo Bike +36 30 868-1107. Cute bike rental shop and bakery cafe. Bike rentals starting at 3,000 per day.\nFor the centre, consider buying a \"ticket\" (1/3/7 days, and longer passes) for city's Mol/Bubi bikes. This municipal initiative allows riding up to 30 minutes for free, and then you can just park and get a new bicycle for another half an hour. They have useful mobile app which shows all the parking lots (about 70 around the city). Extremely convenient and cheap compared to buses.\n\n\n=== By scooter ===\nAlthough not as fancy as in Rome or Paris, scooters are becoming more common in the streets of Budapest. Inside the city scooters can be driven on the tram and bus ways, often buzzing in between traffic. Although most car drivers are quite used to the scooters around them, some can still be slight irresponsible. Ignore their pushiness and drive conservative and you should not experience any problems. The best roads are the main ring roads as these have plenty of space and good asphalt. The smaller in between roads and roads in hilly Buda can be of lesser quality with some unexpected potholes or tough to see speed bumps.\nA limited number of companies offer scooter rental and scooter tours inside the city centre. Expect to pay around Ft6,000 for a day. Some companies that offer scooter rental are:\n\nRetro Robog\u00f3, +36 70 432-0444. Rent a scooter starting at Ft3,600 per day (week rental).\nIn Hungary scooters with an engine up to 50cc can be driven without license plate and only a regular car drivers license. However these 50cc scooters cannot be driven with a passenger. Helmets are compulsory. For scooters and motorcycles with an engine size above 50cc a licence plate and motorcycle driver's licence is required. If you are experienced with driving a scooter, it is a great way to experience the city\n\n\n=== By skateboard ===\nPest is ideal for skateboarding. Pavements are wide and smooth without too many pedestrians to avoid. Police won't pay you any attention as long as you are using your skateboard for transport and not trying to do tricks.\n\n\n== See ==\nIndividual listings can be found in Budapest's district articles\n\nThe Danube. This is what's unique about Budapest, the urban river landscape. This feature can be admired in several ways: from panoramic points, such as Fisherman's Bastion or Gell\u00e9rt Hill's Citadella in South Buda, promenading along the river banks, or from the river's perspective, from a boat. For romantic views of the city, go at night. There is a number of bridges (see Orientation above) that arch over the river and define Budapest. Most famous is the Chain Bridge (Sz\u00e9chenyi L\u00e1nch\u00edd), owing its name to the suspension structure: the bridge is made of chains whose links are huge dog-bone shaped metal bars linked by pins at their ends. And there is also the magnificent Elisabeth bridge (Erzs\u00e9bet h\u00edd) and the Liberty bridge (Szabads\u00e1g h\u00edd). To get away from all the hustle of the city visit Margaret Island (Margitsziget), reachable from the Margaret bridge. Its large parks (see Buda) are a very pleasant place to relax and wander, perfect for a sunny afternoon.\n\nMost of Budapest's famous sights are concentrated on Castle Hill on the Buda side, in downtown so called Belv\u00e1ros and along the riverside walkways.\nOn Budav\u00e1r the main highlight is the Royal Palace (Kir\u00e1lyi palota), which is the most popular attraction on the hill. It is home to the National Gallery and the Historical Museum of Budapest, with exhibits about medieval Budapest and history of the Royal Palace. To the north you can find the funicular on a big square southestern corner, while in the eastern part there are some medieval excavations and castle ruins from 14-17th century. Towards the north, by the D\u00edsz t\u00e9r corner, is the Golden Eagle Pharmacy Museum (Arany Sas Patikam\u00fazeum), with a collection of pharmaceutical objects from the Renaissance and Baroque eras. Near there is the Caf\u00e9 Ruszwurm, or 'the Heaven for coffein and sweets addicts'. A hundred meters east is a local pride, the Matthias Church (M\u00e1ty\u00e1s Templom), which is a Neo-Gothic church crowning Budapest's cityscape,  and the 'Fisherman's bastion', (Hal\u00e1szb\u00e1stya), a lookout terrace with impressive views across the Danube to Pest. In the next building is the Marzipan Museum, which is a children's favourite. On the castle northwest corner is the Military Museum if you interested for uniforms, weapons, maps and other Hungary-related military objects from 11th century until nowadays. If not, you must to go there because the view from there is worth a short detour. Almost all of west Buda hill is visible from here.\nCentral (Belv\u00e1ros) of Pest is the administrative and business centre of Budapest and the whole of Hungary. Visiting first the Parliament Building (Orsz\u00e1gh\u00e1z) is good choice. A Neo-Gothic jewel, it is beautifully situated overlooking the Danube. It is very much worth going inside. Opposite the Parliament, the Museum of Ethnography is located, and just couple hundred metres is St Stephen's Basilica, the main church of Budapest and an important example of Neo-Classical architecture. Take 2 stops by M3 to Astoria station and visit the Jewish quarter (part of Unesco World Heritage), the main Hungarian Jewish holy place the Doh\u00e1ny Street Synagogue and Jewish Museum (Doh\u00e1ny utcai Zsinag\u00f3ga), the largest and certainly among the most beautiful ones in Europe. Take the underpass toward National Museum, on the way admire the E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University on M\u00fazeum k\u00f6r\u00fat. It is worth dropping by for a short visit. Visitors can rest in the lush Trefort Garden or have a refreshment in the popular B\u00f6lcs\u00e9sz Terasz, an open-air cultural garden that has musical performances as well as food. If you take metro to K\u00e1lvin t\u00e9r, you can visit another important museum  which is the Applied Arts museum.\nOutside the centre towards the south take tram 2 to visit the famous Zwack Unicum, a type of alcoholic spirit, company museum, and the new culture hub near to L\u00e1gym\u00e1nyosi bridge include the Ludwig Museum of Modern Art.\n\nEastwards from the city centre (Belv\u00e1ros) the 'Andr\u00e1ssy \u00fat' boulevard in Ter\u00e9zv\u00e1ros stretches to the City Park ('V\u00e1rosliget'). It is listed on  UNESCO World Heritage Site and has some important sights along it. First is the State Opera House, one of the most beautiful opera houses in the world. The main staircase was an important element of the building in the 19th century for ladies to show off their new gowns. Second is Oktogon (eight angled) square House of Terror, the former secret police headquarters that now is a museum which objectively documents the terror of the Nazi and Communist eras. Next are some eastern culture museums in the Hopp Museum of East Asian Art a great collection from China, Japan, India, Nepal, Tibet and Mongolia.  Nearby is another similar collection, namely R\u00e1th Gy\u00f6rgy Museum. Along the boulevard after Oktogon square, you will find many embassies in nice, over 100 year old villas. At the road's end is the Heroes' Square - with the Millennium Monument. Opposite is the Museum of Fine Arts with an incredible range of European artwork from Greek and Roman times to the present. Especially valuable is its collection of Spanish Baroque painting. Behind it there is the zoo and the Gundel restaurant, one of the best of the capital. Woodpark area starts here, with the City Park ('V\u00e1rosliget') at the far end, probably the most pleasant of Pest's districts and featuring several interesting if low-key attractions which are often overlooked. A castle on a little island on a lake, - Vajdahunyad V\u00e1ra, - built for the 1898 World Fair. In the winter, the lake is turned into the city's biggest ice rink. Nowadays it houses an agricultural museum. Also in the park is the Transport Museum.\nOn Buda side north from castle you will find the G\u00fcl Baba T\u00fcrb\u00e9je, a shrine where G\u00fcl Baba (literally Rose Father, from whom the R\u00f3zsadomb (Rose Hill) was named) lies. Take H5 to Szentl\u00e9lek square, which is the heart of \u00d3buda (Old Buda) district. Near to the square is Victor Vasarely Museum showing many works of the famous Hungarian-born post-modern painter V\u00e1s\u00e1rhelyi Gy\u0151z\u0151 (1908-1997), and the Kass\u00e1k Museum at the Zichy Castle showing works of the modern Hungarian artists as well as modern Hungarian art. Also near the square is the Kiscelli Museum, the Budapest Picture Gallery. More one stop on H5 is the city biggest archeological site: the Aquincum, a city in the Roman times, where there are some ruins of thermal baths, built on stone and decorated with mosaics and paintings.\nFar to west (South Buda) is the Memento Park, an open air museum in Budapest, dedicated to monumental statues from Hungary's Communist period (1949\u20131989).\nSouthward from the Castle is the Budai Vigad\u00f3 (Hungarian Heritage House). Between 1898 and 1900 winners of an architectural competition faced a demanding project: build a theater and library to suit the needs of the residents of Buda on the site of a former arsenal. Alad\u00e1r \u00c1rkay and M\u00f3r Kallina worked to change the pre-existing building into a cultural center. The Vigado\u2019s outside is constructed in a relatively simple, eclectic style, but the interior boasts an impressive Art-Nouveau hall with a marble staircase and pillars and a spacious, ornate theater. Today, it is also known as the Hungarian Heritage House and is the home theater of the Hungarian Folk Ensemble.\nMusic related museums are also in the city: the Kod\u00e1ly Museum, the Liszt Museum, former home of Ferenc Liszt, the most famous Hungarian composer, where a collection of his personal objects and instruments can be visited. Bart\u00f3k's House and the Music Museum, includes a collection of musical instruments and the Bartok archive.\n\n\n== Do ==\nThe simplest, and perhaps best of all: get a map, circle the things you want to see, divide up your time and stroll around in the city. Spend time in charming caf\u00e9s or restaurants, preferably not right at the main tourist sites, look at the market stands, walk on a bridge in the evening. The lively atmosphere of this jewel of a city both by day and by night cannot be experienced via guided tours, locked into a tourist bus/boat. Locals are usually happy to help, also to tell you what they think is best to see, what is better to stay away from or for a little chat just to keep up their English or German. Don't hesitate to ask questions.\n Hungaria Koncert, \u260f +36 1 317-1377, hunkonc@ticket.info.hu. Operates cruises with lunch or dinner daily at 14:00, 19:00 and 20:00. This service is 90 minutes with hot buffet lunch or dinner. During the cruise, the Parliament, Chain Bridge, Royal Castle, Palace of Arts, etc. can be seen. \nRent a bike. Rents are around Ft1,800 for half a day. Szentendre is a 2 hours ride from the centre and you get to see nice places, much of the way is at the Danube. If you prefer more organised ways, a guided bike tour gets you some exercise and introduces you to the local geography. For example, staff at Buda Bike [underground garage at the plaza in front of St Stephan's Basilica] are very friendly. They also rent bikes. Bike map on the Net \nWalk in the City park (V\u00e1rosliget) with your children. Walk around the lake and feed the ducks. See the statue of Anonymus at the Vajdahunyad Castle, a fairy-tale-like building. Sz\u00e9chenyi Spa, right next to the lake, is also enjoyable for children (see also the Baths section).\nIn the winter, the same lake is transformed into the large ice-skating rink with an astonishing view during winter. It is a popular place for children and teenagers.\nThe nearby Circus (F\u00f6v\u00e1rosi Nagycirkusz - Great Circus of the Capital) offers performances with international artists.\nNext to it, the Budapest Zoo - one of the oldest in the world - offers more than 800 animals to be seen in a historic atmosphere.\nExperience an opera at Budapest's beautiful State Opera House or a performance of folklore or classical music at any of Budapest's many concert halls (details under Performing arts).\nBudapest River Cruise is an option to discover the city with Danube boat which takes 75 minutes and you can visit the most popular places with it.\n\n\n=== Events ===\n Budapest Spring Festival.

Day tickets cost \u20ac45 and festival passes, including camping cost \u20ac170 if purchased before 15 April and \u20ac200 after. Festival passes without camping cost \u20ac30 less. Sleeping in a tent under the open sky instead of a hotel room gives the complete festival feeling. Safes are available for valuables.   (updated Jan 2017)\n\n\n=== Performing arts and classical music ===\nApart from a renowned music scene, Hungary has a surprisingly rich theatre and art scene and, not surprisingly, Budapest is the epicentre of it. The season begins in mid-September and ends in June. Productions range from classic dramas and traditional operas to post-modern dance performances. The following venues can be particularly interesting for non-Hungarians. Tickets are bookable about one month beforehand at Interticket, the Hungarian theatres' official booking engine with a booking fee of 10% + Ft50.\n\n\n=== Cinema ===\nIn spite of increasing funding difficulties, high quality cinema has remained alive in Budapest. For contemporary non-mainstream European and Hungarian titles turn to Budapest\u2019s excellent art house film chain, Art mozi, most of their branches are provided with a caf\u00e9 or pub and offer pleasant atmosphere to spend your evening. A few selected cinemas of this chain: Ur\u00e1nia National Cinema | Ur\u00e1nia Nemzeti Filmsz\u00ednh\u00e1z where you can see the mainstream European artistic films with new Hungarian ones, the latter sporadically subtitled in English; Cinema Puskin (Puskin Mozi) an elegant, decorated multiplex offering quality, but generally easy-to-watch Hungarian and foreign films; Cinema M\u0171v\u00e9sz (M\u0171v\u00e9sz Mozi) is probably the most popular \u201cArt Mozi\u201d theatre in Budapest; Film Museum \u00d6r\u00f6kmozg\u00f3 (\u00d6r\u00f6kmozg\u00f3 Filmm\u00fazeum) is your best choice if you\u2019re in mood to see a film from the times when Leonardo DiCaprio was a child, mostly film in original language and are subtitled in Hungarian. Mainstream cinemas mainly show subtitled or dubbed Hollywood films and Hungarian romantic films. After the shopping centre revolution in the late 1990s, more than two thirds of the city\u2019s cinema screens are operated by international chains and franchises. Two examples are: Corvin, one of the oldest, although completely modernised cinema in the city. The most centrally located cinema is the Palace Westend in Pest.\n\n\n=== Thermal baths ===\nIndividual listings can be found in Budapest's district articles\n\nBudapest has many thermal springs and its fame is still rising as a major European Spa location. The baths are among last vestige of Turkish culture in Budapest; some baths indeed date back to Turkish times. However, Hungarians have modified and moulded this tradition into something of their own during the last four centuries.\nThermal baths contain several thermal pools. They are usually complemented with multiple steam baths, massage services and other therapies including drinking cures. Unlike in some Scandinavian or German baths, Budapest baths mostly require you to wear your bathing suit.\nAmong foreigners, Russians seem to be most frequent visitors to Budapest's baths, followed by Italians and Americans.\nA tradition of night bath parties has evolved, often revolving around various branches of electronic music, see e.g. Cinetrip.\n\n\n==== Traditional public baths ====\nTraditional public baths used to have a slightly outdated but nowadays improving service and admission system and allow an authentic bathing experience with locals around you. At the cash desk, you sometimes have to select treatments in advance, often they are offered in distinct places of the building. Bathing time is not restricted, and, depending on the system, if you're finished earlier, part of your fee is repaid. Towels and sometimes bathrobe can be rented either at the entrance or inside. Changing clothes can be done either in a common area with lockers (gender segregated) or in cabins (kabinok) which may come in different size and is highly useful for families. While newer systems may be introduced, according to the proper ancient ritual you're handed a token with a number, which is also written on a blackboard inside the cabin door as a security code: you must remember cabin number. To access your cabin again, show your cabin and a token to attendant, and s/he'll open the door and check the number inside. In swimming pools, swimming caps are sometimes obligatory, and are often available for sale or rent.\n\n\n==== Modern baths ====\nModern baths, such as Danubius Grand Thermal Hotel, are usually called spas, although their central component are thermal pool and multitude of steam baths/saunas, which is not always typical for spas in other parts of the world.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nFootball: the Hungarian national soccer team play at Pusk\u00e1s Ar\u00e9na in Zugl\u00f3 district, completed in 2019. Several professional clubs play in the city - those in the top tier (Nemzeti Bajnoks\u00e1g or NB 1) are Ferencv\u00e1rosi, \u00dajpest and MTK Budapest. Honv\u00e9d since 2023 play in the second tier.\nThe city has many health clubs, yoga & pilates clubs, riding schools, swimming pools and squash and tennis courts. On Margaret Island you will find joggers, and swimming in the Haj\u00f3s Olympic Pool. Sports facilities are inexpensive in Budapest.\n\n\n=== Caving ===\nCaving in Budapest ranges from well-lit and renovated Szeml\u0151hegyi cave, where you can go to parts of the cave in a wheelchair, to some of the more extreme tours in the P\u00e1l-v\u00f6lgyi\u2013M\u00e1ty\u00e1s-hegyi cave system, where you have to squeeze through several metres long passages with no room to spare. The P\u00e1l-v\u00f6lgyi\u2013M\u00e1ty\u00e1s-hegyi cave system is recommended for the adventurous (and non-claustrophobic) who wants \"proper caving\" instead of the more \"tourist friendly\" alternatives. The tours lasts between 2\u00bd\u20133 hours and much of the time is spent crawling or climbing, so some degree of fitness is needed. The guided tour includes a helmet, headlamp and overall so bring good shoes. Guides are professional. English guided tours are usually on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays late in the afternoon, but can be pre-booked by groups at other days as well. Bookings need to be for at least 4 people.\nPlease do not litter, write your name on the cave wall or damage the cave in any other way. Part of the experience is the feeling of being in unspoiled nature.\n\n\n== Work ==\nTeaching English is a popular profession for travellers and people moving to Budapest.\nGenerally speaking, finding a full-time job is fairly difficult unless you speak Hungarian. You should also be prepared that Western standards at job interviews regarding personal life and diversity issues do not always apply. Do not be surprised if you are asked about your smoking habits. Also, companies are not always prepared to fully understand and accept people from diverse backgrounds. You should be prepared that most places won't hire you until you speak at least a little Hungarian. Restaurants with a specific country's cuisine, such as Italian restaurants and pizzerias, tend to hire people from that country to make the food more authentic.\n\n\n== Buy ==\nWhen receiving change from a taxi journey, make sure that the money is actually Hungarian. Some taxi drivers have been known to give unsuspecting passengers obsolete Romanian banknotes (lei).\n\nMany reliable exchange bureaux can be found in the city centre near De\u00e1k Ferenc t\u00e9r metro station. For example, there are two shops next two the tourist information. These shops as well as other shops in the area offer a better rate than other banks at tourist spots such as international bus stations and the castle hill. The rate might be even better than getting cash from ATMs. There is also no extra charge. If you're looking for money exchange in the Keleti station, be sure to check exchange rates at all the three money exchange shops along the platforms; they offer differential prices. See Hungary#Money for information on currency and exchange rates.\n\nMost of the visitors from far away end up shopping in Pest in the middle of the city: V\u00e1ci utca and nearby. It is historically the most expensive part of the city. You'll find Hungarian linens and lace, pottery, and other items, in souvenir shops.\nYou definitely want to visit the Great Market Hall (Nagy V\u00e1s\u00e1rcsarnok) at F\u0151v\u00e1m t\u00e9r, the renovated market hall with essential atmosphere (it's at the south end of Vaci). Prices for the same items vary a lot between sellers and aren't set in stone so be sure to compare and bargain.\n\n\n=== Non-speciality shopping ===\nAlso, chain stores can be found along the V\u00e1ci utca (C&A, H&M, Clinique, Estee Lauder, New Yorker, etc.)\nThe shopping malls locally known as \"Plazas\" are usually good for buying clothes, but prices may vary wildly even in shops next to each other. For electronics, the cheap supermarkets like Electro World and Media Markt are good targets, but the quality is on par with the prices. Due to the low cost of labour, a tradition in repairing mobile phones and other appliances exists, and buying second hand electronics is normal. This service is usually offered in smaller private shops.\nAbsinthe is available for purchase at common liquor stores, a must-have purchase for the European traveller. Many brands available in the Market Hall and liquor stores are of poor quality (or not even \"real\" Absinthe).\n\n\n== Eat ==\nIndividual listings can be found in Budapest's district articles\n\nHungarian food deserves to be (and often is) mentioned among the country's main sites. As in other cultures, the Hungarian approach to food combines pride in their own traditions with a readiness to accept outside influences. The result is a vibrant restaurant scene where an Asian-Hungarian fusion restaurant may well be of genuine interest. Luckily, prices are significantly below western Europe's with around \u20ac4 for a budget lunch, and around \u20ac8-14 for a nice evening meal in a mid-range restaurant, depending on place and appetite. Above \u20ac20 per person is definitely considered expensive, but there are enough lavish places above this price range for those looking for something special.\nLocal specialities often revolve around meat (pork, beef, veal, or poultry), often involve liberal use of paprika, however not necessary of the hot kind. Due to a historical translation error, \"goulash soup\" is indeed a soup, not the \"goulash\" that visitors may be familiar with from home which is known as \"p\u00f6rk\u00f6lt\".\n\nMajor specialities include:\n\nguly\u00e1s (leves) usually translated as 'goulash soup' - a filling meat soup (usually beef) with potatoes and paprika, among other ingredients. Served as main dish or as a (heavy) starter. The name refers to the Hungarian version of a cowboy taking care of a 'gulya' (cattleherd).\npaprik\u00e1s veal or chicken cooked in delicious creamy paprika sauce (not spicy)\np\u00f6rk\u00f6lt a stew with of saut\u00e9ed onions and - paprika. Similar to what is served as 'goulash' abroad.\nhal\u00e1szl\u00e9 - fishermen's soup served differently depending on region\n t\u00f6lt\u00f6tt k\u00e1poszta - stuffed cabbage, the cooked cabbage leaves are filled with meat and in a paprika sauce, served with sour cream (similar to cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche or cr\u00e8me acidul\u00e9e)\nBalaton pike-perch (fogas)\ngy\u00fcm\u00f6lcsleves - fruit soup - cold, creamy and sweet, consumed as a starter.\nFrom the desserts, you may not want to miss\n\nSoml\u00f3i galuska, a poem on biscuit dough, cream and chocolate sauce, invented by K\u00e1roly Gollerits at Gundel\nGundel palacsinta - Gundel pancake (crepe) - with a filling prepared with rum, raisin, walnuts, and lemon zest, served with a chocolate sauce, and the careful reader may guess its birthplace.\nK\u00fcrt\u0151skal\u00e1cs, (chimney cake) a delicious sweet dough pastry which is cooked on a chimney shaped spit and coated in butter and sugar to form a crispy crust. After the cakes are cooked they can be rolled in a variety of toppings such as cinnamon sugar or chocolate.\nThere is also a great variety of wonderful pastries/cakes (Torta), some of which you will recognize if you are familiar with Viennese pastries. You may want to try Dobos torta (Dobos cake, named after J\u00f3zsef Dobos), and Rig\u00f3 Jancsi a light chocolate-cream cake.\nIn addition to traditional Hungarian fare, which is recommended, there are numerous other cuisines available in Budapest.  The adventurous gourmand can enjoy a different cuisine each meal for a week.  Restaurant prices in Budapest are very reasonable by American and Western European standards with a general rule being that you would pay twice as much for a similar meal in New York, London or Paris.\n\n\n=== Coffee houses ===\nCoffee houses (k\u00e1v\u00e9h\u00e1z) were a traditional Budapest institution, somewhat resembling Viennese lifestyle. Visit to one should be on every traveller's agenda. These are places are great to spend some time at a cup of coffee and a delicious cake, but some of them (especially in the higher price range) offer meals as well. With dozens of places in the city, the best-known, landmark coffeehouses (and among priciest) are: Gerbeaud (V\u00f6r\u00f6smarty t\u00e9r 7-9), M\u0171v\u00e9sz K\u00e1v\u00e9h\u00e1z (Andr\u00e1ssy \u00fat 29), New York K\u00e1v\u00e9h\u00e1z (Erzs\u00e9bet krt. 9-11). Other K\u00e1v\u00e9h\u00e1zs worth visiting include the cafe at the Hotel Astoria, Cafe Central, the Cafe Mozart, Wall Street and the oldest in Budapest, the Ruszwurm in Buda castle.\n\n\n=== Restaurants ===\n\nHungarian cuisine and restaurant experiences are happily remembered by visitors, even if the Hungarian diet may seem rather meat-based to many western visitors. The city has large variety of great places to eat at prices quite reasonable for western-Europeans. Like in some other cities, a number of restaurants see tourists as scapegoats. It is a good idea to avoid restaurants in the heart of the most touristic areas like V\u00e1ci utca, especially if all customers seem foreigners, as you'll likely be served mediocre food with a high bill padded with number of bizarre charges. In some restaurants anything you don't explicitly ask for, but appears on your table, is likely to be charged for. Don't take restaurant tips from suspicious individuals on the streets, ask at your hotel or local friends.\nA wide variety of decent food for not reasonable prices can be found at the lively R\u00e1day utca, venue of a number of cultural events, near K\u00e1lvin t\u00e9r. But simply strolling the more central areas, e.g. near the Great Ringroad (Nagyk\u00f6r\u00fat), or the Pozsonyi \u00fat, will be enough to bump into nice places to test local cooking skill (though not necessarily with a menu available in English).\nTop-notch quality food (1st category restaurants) charge a wide range of prices (from starters around Ft1,000, main courses Ft3,000-10,000, and menus from Ft5,000). Perhaps the most reputed among top restaurants is the Gundel near V\u00e1rosliget. Check the prices before you decide to go, but it offers a good value Sunday brunch for around Ft5,000.\nWalking along the Danube on the Pest side, you see a lot of restaurant and bar boats. Most of them serve traditional Hungarian and international dishes, some of them are function more as bars. Thanks to the beautiful panorama across the Danube and the castle, these places provide an unforgettable experience.\nOf special note: Hungarian law does not require restaurants to forward either the (included) service charge or the added tip to the wait staff. Dubious restaurants, especially those favored by tourists, will simply pocket the extra Forint into their private coffers. While it is customary to tip 10% of the bill, it is important to ask your waiter if the service charge is included in the bill and if the staff receives either the service charge or any additional tip. Obviously, it is better to frequent restaurants which treat their staff well, but you may not know in which kind of establishment you are dining until you receive the bill and inquire.\n\n\n==== Chains ====\nOnly cross-district chains are listed here; see district articles for individual restaurants.\n\n Wasabi, Podmaniczky utca 21 ( :close to Nyugati station). M-F 11:00-17:00. Excellent Japanese and Korean food. Lunch Ft3,790. The Buda unit: Sz\u00e9pv\u00f6lgyi \u00fat 15 (train station Sz\u00e9pv\u00f6lgyi \u00fat) 11:00-23:00. \n Tr\u00f3fea Grill. The best among all-you-can-eat (buffet) and all the alcohol you can drink. Best to book a table in advance.

Very fashionable interiors and popular with the well-paid white collar crowd. Reservations are recommended during traditional peak times. When eating here, always make sure that you won't be slapped on an extra 100% service charge. Read the menu before entering the restaurant carefully and insist on talking to someone who speaks English. \n\n\n=== Vegetarian/vegan ===\n Govinda. M\u2013F 11:30\u201320:00, Sa 12:00\u201321:00. Great vegan/vegetarian restaurant in Budapest. You can choose from different menus every day or just order separate dishes; moderately priced. The Govinda chain has three restaurants in Budapest. The main restaurant is at Vigy\u00e1z\u00f3 Ferenc utca 4, Govinda Vega Corner is at Papn\u00f6velde utca 1, and the Govinda-Buda is at \u00c1rp\u00e1d fejedelem utca 33. See maps, Vigy\u00e1z\u00f3 Ferenc utca 4 \n Edeni Vegan, Iskola utca 31 (1 block from Batthy\u00e1ny t\u00e9r metro station), \u260f +36 6203 0775 75. Daily 08:00-20:00. Cafeteria-style restaurant, large portions, relatively cheap. Food may vary depending on day, time, and dishes chosen. Tofu goulash recommended. Staff are very helpful at explaining the dishes so ask what they are if you don't know. Cash only. There is an ATM at the bank across the street. (updated Jul 2017)\n\n\n=== Grocery shopping ===\nIf you want to take home some Hungarian paprika, Pick szal\u00e1mi, or Tokaji wine, grocery shops are naturally cheaper than specialised souvenir kiosks.\nIn the central areas, you will find smaller grocery shops such as the Hungarian chains GRoby shops, CBA shops, and the usual European suspects Spar and Tesco Express shops.\nFurther from the centre, you can find foreign-owned hypermarkets like Auchan & Tesco with the usual range of goods.\n\n\n==== Cooking class ====\nThe best way to get to know a culture is through its food! Join a Hungarian host in cooking a Hungarian menu in an authentic Hungarian home.\nEasy Cooking Budapest offers the perfect program: shopping at a local market, then cooking together in a small group at an apartment, while tasting some wine and P\u00e1linka. www.easycookingbudapest.com\n\n\n=== Kosher ===\n\n Hanna's Kosher Kitchen, VII. Dob utca 35, \u260f +361 342-1072. Features classic Hungarian food, but Kosher. \n Kinor David, VII. Doh\u00e1ny utca (next to the big Doh\u00e1ny Temple), \u260f +36 1 413-7304, +36 1 413-7305. \n Salamon glatt kosher restaurant, 1072 Budapest, VII.

Translated from Turkish d\u00f6ner, gyros means \"rotate\" or \"spintop\" in Greek - a reference to the meat being rotated on a stake.\nOne good moderately priced Turkish halal place is Szer\u00e1j on Szt. Istv\u00e1n k\u00f6r\u00fat opposite to the theatre building of \"V\u00edgsz\u00ednh\u00e1z\", between Nyugati t\u00e9r Margaret Bridge.\n\n\n== Drink ==\nIndividual listings can be found in Budapest's district articles\nBudapest offers plenty of places to drink, from cool and ultra-hip to rowdy and down-market. If you are in the mood for a particularly Hungarian experience, visit a so-called boroz\u00f3 (wine pub). These offer cheap yet tasty Hungarian wine on tap at outright hilariously low prices if you manage to find one outside the tourist circuit.\nHungary is famous for its wines produced at Balaton area and Eger. Among red wines the best are K\u00e9kfrankos, Egri Bikav\u00e9r \"Bulls Blood\u201d and white wines the Sz\u00fcrkebar\u00e1t and Chardonnay are popular. One of the most favorite is the Tokaji, a sweet white wine.\nYou should try not to miss out on the Hungarian spirit, p\u00e1linka, made from fruits such as plum, apricot, cherry or Williams pears.\nUnique Hungarian soft drinks to try are Traubi Szoda (a white grape soda) and M\u00e1rka (a sour cherry soda).\n\n\n== Sleep ==\nIndividual listings can be found in Budapest's district articles\nBudapest offers a wide range of accommodation in all price classes from the hostels which start at \u20ac7 per night, to small cheap pension, to the luxurious 5-star hotels, although the costs of staying here are notably higher than elsewhere in Hungary.\nArriving trains are often met by touts offering free rides to hostels, as well as little old grannies offering their apartments for rent. Try to figure out exactly where you're going before you choose - or, better yet, visit any of the many travel agencies to browse the many options in a more comfortable environment.\nThe most expensive are on or near Castle Hill, dozens of reliable backpacker hostels are mostly across the river in Pest. However, Buda has better air quality due to the closeness of the hills and the forests lying to the west from the city.\nApartments may be a cheap alternative for those making extended stays.\n\n\n== Learn ==\nBudapest's universities are sufficiently well-regarded and draw exchange students from near and far. There are a number of universities and other tertiary institutions in Budapests. Many of them offer degrees or courses in English, German, or French. Particularly popular, even though not cheap, are the medical university courses offered in German and English.\n\n18 Central European University, Nador u. 9, \u260f +36 1 327 3000.

(updated Nov 2016)\n\n\n== Stay safe ==\nCentral Emergency: dial 112\nAmbulance: 104\nFire: 105\nPolice: 107\n\n\n=== Crime ===\nBudapest is potentially one of the safest cities in the world for its size. There are no slums or districts you should avoid, particularly not in the touristy areas or nearby. As a traveller, you should take only normal precautions: don't show off your money and don't wear flashy jewellery. Magyars tend to be friendly with foreigners; racism or xenophobia against tourists is practically unknown.\nAs in most other big cities, pickpocketing is the most common crime against tourists. The rate of picked pockets is relatively low by Western European and U.S. standards, and you're unlikely to have any problem if you follow some basic rules you wouldn't forget in Paris, Brussels or Vienna. The most important rules are that you never wear a backpack or purse on your back in public transportation or other places with a lot of people, and make sure that you have your wallet in one of your front pockets.\nYounger Hungarian policemen mostly speak some basic English. Tourists have no reason to be afraid of them unless they break the law.\nDuring the peak tourist season, police patrolling major tourist areas are accompanied by bilingual or multi-lingual students who assist with problems or complaints. Police have also opened a 24/7 TourInform office in one of Budapest's busiest areas. It is located at S\u00fct\u0151 Street 2, District V, and they are able to receive complaints and render assistance in English and German.\n\n\n=== By night ===\n\nMostly there's no reason to have concerns about Budapest by night. In practice, the whole city, including all the touristy areas, Pest within the inner ring road (the line of Szent Istv\u00e1n k\u00f6r\u00fat\u2013Ter\u00e9z k\u00f6r\u00fat\u2013Erzs\u00e9bet k\u00f6r\u00fat\u2013J\u00f3zsef k\u00f6r\u00fat\u2013Ferenc k\u00f6r\u00fat, popularly known as Nagyk\u00f6r\u00fat), and Buda are safe even before dawn. Most locals avoid walking alone by night in outer zones of districts 8th and 9th in Pest, as these are shady, though not particularly dangerous areas. Areas in 8th district behind N\u00e9psz\u00ednh\u00e1z utca - J\u00f3zsef k\u00f6r\u00fat can be a bit risky, although the district is CCTV monitored by the police. If you don't have special thing to do there, try not to have a walk at night at Lujza, Dank\u00f3, Magdolna Streets and their surroundings: also, it's not a very attractive area. N\u00e9psz\u00ednh\u00e1z utca itself is not a very nice place after dark but usually not risky.\nSome big panel areas on the outskirts of the city (parts of \u00dajpest and K\u0151b\u00e1nya, residential areas unknown by tourists) also not the best places to have a walk without knowing where to go. The area around Keleti p\u00e1lyaudvar is also not very friendly, but usually nothing happens. Avoid homeless people asking for money or selling something in the big underpasses. The subway at Nyugati t\u00e9r collects different types of people; it is generally not risky because of heavy traffic day and night, but try not to look very \"lost\" there.\nBeautiful during the day, bigger public parks like V\u00e1rosliget, are better avoided at night. Don't take a healthy walk at N\u00e9pliget after dark. The famous 'chill-out' place at R\u00f3mai part (3rd district) can be deserted especially after 01:00 and in the winter season, although it's usually safe. Don't go to the dark paths alone around Citadella at night.\nNight buses and the tram no.6 passing through the city centre can be very crowded at peak socialising times on Friday and Saturday nights. You may come across aggressive drunk youngsters on the vehicles or at the stops. Keep a low profile or avoid the public transportation system on weekend nights. Major night lines are now guarded by security staff.\n\n\n=== Tourist traps ===\nLike in several cities of the world, in Budapest the major scams for the inexperienced visitor are taxis and restaurants. Much of the following would apply to a number of highly touristed cities in Europe.\nIn the past the airport taxis used to be a traveller's nightmare. Now, things ave gotten better: F\u0151taxi - contracted partner of the airport - is so far reported to be reliable and works according to advertised prices; for details read the Airport transfer section. F\u0151taxi has a stand outside the terminal building, enjoying the exclusive right to wait there, though other companies can come to pick up passengers if called by phone. Sometimes scam taxi drivers will still solicit services inside the terminal to take you for a ride with a very hungry meter. Fixed price information on the internet.\nAlternatives to F\u0151taxi include calling another trusted cab firm (saving \u20ac5-10), or to use the Airport Minibus service. Airport Minibus has a booth inside the terminal and they will allocate you to a minibus with several others who are going to the same area of the city. Depending on how lucky you are, yours may be the first destination or the last. However, it is only cheaper than a taxi if you are travelling alone. If you travel the from the city to the airport, pre-order your taxi on the chosen company's phone number or call for the Airport Shuttle. The Airport Shuttle is reasonably priced, reliable and an efficient way to get to the airport.\nThe situation around railway and bus stations is still not regulated. The worst is probably Keleti P\u00e1lyaudvar: never trust drivers hanging around the arrival side; rather, order a taxi by phone (some cars display their company's number). If that's not possible, take only taxis with a logo of the bigger companies, and with a proper sign on the roof and taxi licence plate. As a general rule, make sure the taximeter is on (and not set to the special \"extortionate rate for unwary tourists\") or agree the price with the driver beforehand. Many cases have been reported in which taxi drivers have extorted hundreds of euros from unwary visitors. Smaller crimes include being given change in worthless, obsolete Romanian or other currency, which is not instantly recognizable by tourists as non-Hungarian currency. Other drivers take a longer route, which means a higher price, if you don't have an agreed price. If you have an agreed price, you can be sure to arrive to your destination in the shortest route possible. A typical taxi drive within the central zones should be in the range of Ft1,200-3,000 as of early 2014.\nSimilar abuses have also happened in restaurants and bars, almost all of them in the vicinity of V\u00e1ci utca in the touristy heart of Pest. You should avoid the eateries and bars of the zone. However, these are not typical, the majority of restaurants and pubs in Budapest are reliable. In Hungary it's compulsory to put the menu card outside the entrance; if it's not the case, don't enter.\nDon't take any tip on the streets, especially if the person is apparently a gift from heaven and is being very, very nice to you.\nDon't befriend the girls hanging around V\u00e1ci utca, and never accept any invitation for a drink from them: you can be sure that they will lead you to fake Champagne, but you will be left only with the bill, and it's unlikely that a small conversation with them will be worth the hundreds of euros. You'll find the same sort of girls in erotic and topless bars; avoid them unless you're ready to pay your monthly salary for a glass of wine. The standard trick is to produce a menu with small print at the bottom stating that the first drink costs Ft15,000 and consumption is compulsory. This modified menu might be produced only when the bill is presented. Most of the erotic bars in Budapest are tourist traps.\nA common scam is for attractive women to walk up to men and ask for directions to a particular bar. If you respond \"I don't know\", they will ask you if you have a map and say \"let's go together\" they commonly tell you a story such as \"I just got in from Bratislava and am just looking for a good place to get a drink...\".\nThe most popular scam involves a blond girl and a shorter girl with dark hair. They always act together and ask for a cigarette or the time. Next, they invite single men for a drink, in a bar at V\u00e1ci utca only accessible by an elevator from the street. Once there, each drink costs around \u20ac50, but you only find that out at the end when you receive the \u20ac500 bill. So never go to the elevator bar (V\u00e1rosk\u00f6zpont) at V\u00e1ci utca.\nTravellers are cautioned to avoid any establishment offering \"adult\" entertainment. A common scam in these places is for an attractive woman to join you at your table and ask for a drink. The problem is that her drink will cost \u20ac250 or something similar. You will not be allowed to leave until you pay. If you threaten to call the police you will probably be informed that the bouncer is an off duty police officer.\nTopBudapestOrg maintains a list of blacklisted clubs and bars.\nMoney conversion: like in other places, even if a restaurant or bar accepts euros, it's better to have forints since their conversion rate is usually way worse than the rate at exchange offices. It is better to avoid exchange offices inside airports and railway stations, those in the centre of the city offer a much better exchange rate.\nIf you see people gambling on the streets, usually in popular tourists' destinations like Buda Castle, stay away. The modus operandi usually involves a guy playing the classic \"shell game\". This involves covering a ball (or small trinket) with either a bottle cap or a match box and swirling it around with two other bottle caps asking people to guess the position of the ball. The game is set in a way that you can easily see the ball's position. This is done to lure the unsuspecting person into placing a wager. There are usually two main players and, between them, they will lose and win money back and forth to give the appearance that it is a fair game: do not be tricked. They are from the same gang. Once you get greedy and get lured in, you will surely lose your money. The person in control of the bottle caps will remove the ball from their position through sleight of hand and you will never see your money back. Besides the two or three other players involved, there are usually at least two lookouts: one on each side of 'stage'.\nOn the other hand, Hungarian people are usually friendly, welcoming and interested towards foreigners, and nothing should happen to you unless you put yourself in harm's way. If you don't bother them they won't bother you, and nothing should get in your way of having a great holiday.\n\n\n== Stay healthy ==\n Emergencies, \u260f 112 (free call). \n Ambulance, \u260f 104 (free call). \n Police, \u260f 107 (free call).

        "title": "Hanoi",
        "extract": "Hanoi (Vietnamese: H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i), the capital of Vietnam and its second-largest city, is a fascinating blend of East and West, with Chinese influence from centuries of dominance, and French je ne sais quoi from its colonial past. It was largely unspoiled by the modern architecture of the 1970s and 80s, and is now undergoing a rapid transformation that makes it a rising star in Southeast Asia.\n\n\n== Understand ==\n\nInvading forces from every direction agree: Hanoi makes a fine capital. It has held that title for more than a thousand years, through several invasions, occupations, restorations, and name changes. The Chinese conquered the imperial city of \u0110\u1ea1i La in 1408 and renamed it T\u1ed1ng B\u00ecnh. Le Loi repelled the invaders in 1428 and applied the name of L\u00ea Th\u00e1i T\u1ed5 (\u9ece\u592a\u7956). For his efforts, he received the crown and a slew of legends about his heroic exploits, many centred around Hoan Kiem Lake. The Nguyen Dynasty gave the city its modern name of Ha Noi in 1831, but they had transferred power to Hue by then. Hue remained the capital until 1887, when the French made Hanoi the capital of all Indochina. It changed hands again in 1954, when it was ceded to Ho Chi Minh and the Viet Minh after almost a decade of fighting, and it became the capital of North Vietnam. Upon reunification in 1975, it assumed that title for the entire country. (See also: Indochina Wars).\nHanoi retains much of its older colonial charm, despite the battles that have raged over it. Conflict had the effect of making it largely oblivious to modern architecture, and as a result, few buildings in the city center are higher than five stories. The Old Quarter, the area around and north of Hoan Kiem Lake, is second only to Hoi An for uninterrupted stretches of colonial and pre-colonial architecture, well-preserved on dense warrens of narrow, wonderfully atmospheric streets.\nThe first Western-style universities in Vietnam were founded in Hanoi, and today, it is the leading centre of scientific study and research in the country. It trades the commercial boom and sprawl of Ho Chi Minh City in the south for a more understated charm, worth enjoying for an extra day or two; and with countless transport options and travel agents, it makes a perfect base for exploration of the North.\nAs you walk along the street, you may find that people start talking to you. It is a cultural norm there to make conversation with strangers. They might ask you where you are from and other general questions. But if you are a man, be cautious if a comely young lady approaches you and initiates a conversation - she is likely after something. It may take a while to get used to such overt friendliness, but it is worth enjoying it for the cultural experience that travel permits.\n\n Tourist Information Centre, \u0110inh Ti\u00ean Ho\u00e0ng St. (just north of Hoan Kiem Lake), \u260f +84 24 3926-3366. Can provide a fairly useful map (bewilderingly, the blow-up of the old town is missing) and other English-language advice, as well as limited free Internet. (updated Mar 2025)\nThere are self-help information booths around the Old Quarter, but their purpose mostly is give the impression that Vietnam \"has arrived\" technologically.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nThe T\u1ebft holiday (Lunar New Year) is in the spring. Flowers are most beautiful during this time of the year. The weather warms up, with occasional light rain during the week. Locals believe that these light rains bring prosperity and luck in the new year.\nSummer, on the other hand, borders on intolerable. The heat alone would be alright, but it's coupled with oppressive humidity and frequent rainstorms. At this time, visitors should be wary of mosquitoes as they abound. Hanoi has a perfect climate for the proliferation of insects.\nThere is something unique about Hanoi\u2019s autumn. The weather is perfect, with less humidity in the air. The temperature drops, allowing people a chance to flaunt their sweaters and jackets. Milkwood trees (\"c\u00e2y hoa s\u1eefa\"), which only flowers in autumn, commonly lines many streets. The flower has a very distinct scent; if you visit Hanoi during the fall, ask locals about this tree and where you might sniff its distinct aroma.\nWinter can be uncomfortable because it's not only cold, but also humid. Winter in Hanoi feels even colder than it is because Vietnamese houses lack central heating; many houses have no heating at all. However, the winter months of December and January are also the driest months of the year with comparatively less rainfall, with the rains gradually picking up from the middle of February onwards. Pollution is unfortunately worst in winter, thanks to rampant waste burning, seasonal lack of rainfall, and the surrounding mountains trapping dirty air in the low-lying capital - Hanoi has frequently ranked among the top 5 most-polluted cities in the world in the past few years.\n\n\n== Get in ==\n\n\n=== By plane ===\n\n1 N\u1ed9i B\u00e0i International Airport (HAN  IATA) (35 km north of the city center), \u260f +84 1900 636535. You can transfer through N\u1ed9i B\u00e0i to other international destinations without a visa as long as you do not leave the terminal. International flights use Terminal 2, opened in 2015 and modern and spacious. There is a shuttle bus between the domestic and international terminals, or it can be walked in about 15-20 minutes. As of March 2025, Terminal 2 is undergoing large-scale expansion works; construction is planned to be finished by December 2025.   (updated Mar 2025)\nThere are direct international flights from all major South East Asian capitals, most major Chinese and Taiwanese cities, and also from Bali, Sydney, Melbourne, Delhi, Mumbai, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Doha, Istanbul, Munich, Frankfurt, Paris, and London. Direct flights from Milan will commence on 1 July 2025. No direct flights from North America for now \u2013 Ho Chi Minh City, Taipei, Seoul or Tokyo will usually be the most convenient interchange. Domestic flights, by Vietnam Airlines, Bamboo Airways and Vietjet Air, serve Ho Chi Minh City, Da Nang, Hue, Nha Trang, Da Lat, Can Tho, Vinh, Dien Bien Phu, and Phu Quoc island.\nGetting there and away:\nPublic and express buses depart from the arrivals level at the International Terminal, second road, at pillar 2 (turn left after exiting the terminal). From the Domestic Terminal they leave from between the Vietnam Airlines and Vietjet Air terminals. \n\nBy public bus \u2013 Bus 07 (8,000 dong) runs 05:00\u201322:00 every 15 min and takes 60-90 min. It crosses the Thang Long Bridge and goes to the Daewoo Hotel in the west of Hanoi, from where it is 1 hr on foot to the Old Quarter of Hanoi. You might have to walk about 1 km west of the airport to catch bus 07 if it does not leave in front of the terminal.\nBy express bus \u2014 Bus 86 (45,000 dong) runs 06:20\u201322:00 every 25 min and takes 45 min. It takes the expressway non-stop to the Tay Ho area, continuing limited stop to the Long Bien bus station, near the Old Quarter, the Opera House, Mel\u00eda Hotel and the railway station. Towards the airport, buses run 05:05-21:40 from a booth at the south end of the main railway station.\nBy shuttle bus \u2013 (It is not clear if these are still running as of June 2022.) Hourly between the airport and the  Vietnam Airlines Downtown Office, 25 Tr\u00e0ng Thi / 1 Quang Trung (a bit south of the old quarter but conveniently stocked with taxis and motorbike drivers), \u260f +84 24 3934-9660.  Tickets at the airport are sold in the building in front of which the minibuses park, or you can give the fare directly to the  driver. The cost is more for foreigners than for Vietnamese (which includes ethnic Vietnamese from overseas) for insurance reasons. The prices are indicated on the sticker fixed to the bus's body. The driver may give you trouble if you have additional bags, but if you push, you will get the same rate.\nBy taxi \u2013 There are taxi stands just outside arrivals; turn right from the Domestic Terminal (T1), or left from International (T2). Avoid the touts in the arrival and just head straight for the taxi stand; the taxis they will try to get you in are most likely illegal, and you are likely to get ripped off. Official taxis are provided by various taxi companies, and all should run on the meter; Mai Linh and Taxi Group are generally the safest taxi companies to use. Have the address you want to go to ready and written down in Vietnamese \u2014 the chances of you speaking it in a way the driver will understand are slim. Maybe print out a map beforehand, since every street in Hanoi has clearly visible street signs at both ends, you should be able to discern which street you are in.\nA ride into the Old Quarter should cost 300,000\u2014350,000 dong (Mai Linh taxi, July 2015) and come up somewhere around 27-28 km in distance on the meter. The French Quarter or south side of Hoan Kiem lake might be a little more, but still under 400,000 dong. Many taxis, including Taxi Group and ABC, accept credit cards \u2014 ask first and show them the credit card. You might also get offered a fixed price of US$20 by the driver, which works out as about a 25% premium.\nSome drivers will ask something like 800,000 dong, especially if they see 3-4 foreigners \u2014 just ignore them. Make sure that the meter starts shortly after the taxi moves off, and if you want to be sure the meter's not running fast, then from the International Terminal it should have reached about 0.7 km by the time you reach the airport toll booths (taxis don't pay the toll), and around 2 km by the time you pass the Domestic Terminal (the distance will be displayed in km, often along with the speed). A ride into the city should take about 30-40 minutes on the new highway depending on traffic.\nDownloading Grab app (local Uber) helps a lot. Fares around 300,000 dong to the city center, depending on demand, or about half of that by motorcycle, if you feel adventurous and only have a backpack.\nBy pre-arranged transfer \u2013 If you already have a hotel booked, you might ask the hotel to dispatch a driver. The nicer hotels will do this and put the steep fare on your room bill.\nStay safe:\nTaxi or shuttle bus drivers might try the 'typhoon in Ha Long Bay' scam whereby they take you to a street where you cannot see the hotel name and tell you that the Ha Long Bay guests are still in the hotel and they will take you to their other hotel for the same price. This place is a complete dive facing the highway.\nYou should also beware taxi drivers trying to offer you a ride to your hotel for an inflated price, claiming the Old Quarter is 5 km from the office \u2014 it is much cheaper to go to the Vietnam Airlines office and switch to a taxi (or walk, it's a maximum of 2 km to anywhere in the Old Quarter). The taxi will not cost more than the price difference and if it does, you should refuse to pay as the driver has somehow cheated you.\n\n\n=== By train ===\n2 Hanoi Station, Ga H\u00e0ng C\u1ecf, 120 L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n St., \u260f +84 24 3825-3949.   \nMost trains use the main Hanoi train station for daily services from cities in the south including Hue and Nha Trang. The Reunification Express goes all the way to Ho Chi Minh City (\"Saigon\"), although there is very little 'express' about it. There are ten trains a day to HCMC taking 31-38 hours, but five of them are slow and are overtaken by faster trains \u2014 only use them for destinations north of Da Nang.\nThere are also train services to the northwest (including Lao Cai, from which you reach Sapa). To board trains bound for these destinations, you have to enter the railway station compound through the \"backdoor\" at Tran Quy Cap station.\nTickets for all destinations are sold online (see Vietnam article) or in the main station.\nIn high season, buy your tickets as early as possible, especially since sleeper tickets can be sold out several days in advance. If you can't get a ticket anymore, try a travel agent who still might have stock. You may also try your luck in the station just before boarding time \u2014 agents still holding tickets will be eager to sell as the departure draws near. Nevertheless, travel agencies in Hanoi are known for their bad business practices. Some of them will try to overcharge you up to 300%, so it is better go to the train station by yourself and find out about the prices before you agree on any deal.\n\n\n==== Stay safe ====\nAs of 2023, it seems like the ladies in the ticket hall are running a scam against tourists who are willing to buy their train tickets directly at the train station and not online. First there are two suspiciously friendly and helpful English speaking ladies to the left after the entrance into the railway building. Actually, you are already flagged down by some other ladies outside the entrance, who will guide you to the English speaking ladies. These ladies will ask your destination and day of travel. First they will head to the official Vietnamese Railways website, checking for the connections. After that they will do the same procedure again but with the Baolau website \u2014 note that Baolau will always display some weird overly expensive prices of other \"companies\" at the bottom of their search result list. The friendly ladies might use these \"extra\" prices and your slow reaction to what is happening to convince you that these are the prices while indeed the prices of the Vietnamese Railway Company at the top of the result page are the actual and much cheaper prices. In case you do not take the bait, because you know the real price for your connection since you checked online beforehand, they are very quick in handing you to the actual ticket sellers to the right after the entrance, where you will have to state all the required details of your intended journey again.\nSo, to avoid being ripped off, book online or know the exact details of your journey, the price and availability, maybe even the exact seat or bed you would like to reserve. It is a very bad idea to turn up at the railway station asking for advice without knowing the exact details and price of your intended journey. If your first questions heading into the railway station are \"When can we go?\", \"Which seats are available?\", and \"What does it cost?\", you are likely to be scammed.\n\n\n==== From China ====\nAs of 2025, there is no international train service between Vietnam and China. The MR1/2 overnight sleeper train calling at Gia L\u00e2m (Hanoi)\u2013\u0110\u1ed3ng \u0110\u0103ng\u2013Pingxiang\u2013Nanning was cancelled in February 2020 due to Covid-19, and there seem to be no plans for its reinstatement. \nIn early 2025, the Vietnamese government approved a massive semi-high-speed (120-160 km/h) rail project connecting the port city of Haiphong to the border town of Lao Cai, and continuing across the Chinese border all the way to Kunming. This will link up the majority of northern Vietnam's major cities, Hanoi included, into the Chinese high-speed rail network; allowing for fast and convenient cross-border rail travel. As of Mar 2025, the line is planned to open by 2030, although this is subject to potential delays. \n\n\n=== By bus ===\nFor buses within Hanoi there is BusMap and BusMap Ha Noi; long distance buses there is VeXeRe.com and its app version. Long distance buses arrive at My Dinh bus station (B\u1ebfn Xe M\u1ef9 \u0110\u00ecnh) and many other places depending on the bus company.\nPublic buses from southern destinations (e.g., Ninh Binh, 2 hr, 70,000 dong) arrive at Giap Bat bus station. To get from the Giap Bat bus station to the old quarter and Hoan Kiem Lake, leave aside all the hassle of taxi and motorbike drivers and take public Bus 8 towards \u0110\u00f4ng M\u1ef9 (7,000 dong, pay on the bus). To find it head towards the main road inside Giap Bat station, you will see signs with numbers indicating the stops of different bus lines.\nMost of the \"open-tour\" bus itineraries either begin or end in Hanoi, with Hue the next (or previous) stop (12-14 hr), and from there to Hoi An, Nha Trang, Dalat, Mui Ne, Ho Chi Minh City, and other cities in Vietnam, depending on the bus company. Most seem to stop at their office which could be right next to the old district and most backpacker hotels. Check when booking ticket.\nMany of the same companies also sell tickets to Vientiane and Savannakhet in Laos. Do some research before you buy a ticket, as rattle-trap scam buses abound on this route.\nSee Ho Chi Minh City to Shanghai overland if you're interested in crossing over to China by bus or train.\n\n\n===== From China =====\nApec Travel runs several daily buses from Nanning in China to its office at 55 Tr\u1ea7n Kh\u00e1t Ch\u00e2n St., on the south side of Hanoi's city center. Journey time is around 8 hours, including a change of bus and the usual formalities at the border.\n\n\n== Get around ==\n\n\n=== By metro ===\nLine 2A connects C\u00e1t Linh (west of the Old Quarter) to Y\u00ean Ngh\u0129a in the southwestern suburbs. Line 3 connects C\u1ea7u Gi\u1ea5y to Nh\u1ed5n in the northwestern suburbs. The lines are not connected but this will change when the underground stretch between C\u1ea7u Gi\u1ea5y and Hanoi Station opens around 2027. Line 2A is useful for getting to Vincom Mega Mall Royal City, one of Hanoi's largest shopping malls, which is within walking distance of Th\u01b0\u1ee3ng \u0110\u00ecnh station.\n\n\n=== By bus ===\nScam-free, cheap but a bit difficult to comprehend at first, the buses in Hanoi are relatively fast, air-conditioned and surprisingly comfortable.\nFind you way:\n\nDownload the BusMap H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i mobile app (Google Play, Apple Store) for directions and live time estimates (not very accurate).\nPick up a physical map with printed bus lines at the Trang Tien street (the book street by the Opera house).\nFind your bus stop (there are usually blue signs) and wait for the bus to arrive. Go and sit in the bus, the bus assistant will come to you. The fare varies between 7,000 dong and 9,000 dong (price is fixed and depends on the line) (as of June 2024). If necessary, they should have enough cash for change (but it might be better to avoid paying with larger bills). Locals with Vietnamese banks can also pay with their phones. If you are unfamiliar with the city, make sure to inform the mostly helpful conductor where you want to get off. Or, use your phone's GPS and Google Maps - it works well with most bus lines, just keep in mind that traffic jams make schedules unreliable.\nHere is also some information about airport bus route 86; in Old Quarter, the bus stops at other stops along the route in addition to those marked. Find a bus stop on H\u00e0ng Tre, H\u00e0ng V\u00f4i, or \u0110inh Ti\u00ean Ho\u00e0ng (marked with standard bus signs), wait for a 86 bus, and flag it down to board.\n\n\n=== By taxi ===\nThe easiest way to get around is by using Grab (Android, iOS). The English user interface makes navigation a cinch, fares are fixed and typically cheaper, and you can pay by cash or credit card.\n\n\n==== By metered taxi ====\nTaxis proper are small cars seating 4 or larger cars seating 7. Within the city, three companies are generally reliable: CP Taxi and Hanoi Taxi are two brands of Taxi Group, in white cars, and Mai Linh are in green cars. Taxi N\u1ed9i B\u00e0i specialise in airport transfers. \nYour hotel will call a reliable firm, and leave them in no doubt where they are supposed to be taking you.\nUnless you ordered by app, use the meter, flag-fall will be 20,000 dong for the first 2 km. Tips are not expected, but they are appreciated.\nGood-spirited haggling, and a bit of language confusion, are part of the experience. Scams are more serious: these include crooked meters, roundabout routes, stealing part of your luggage and outright robbery. And even the nicest driver somehow never has change for your big bill: always hoard small bills.\n\n\n==== By motorbike taxi ====\nMotorbike taxis can be found on virtually every corner, especially in the Old Quarter: don't look for them, they'll accost you, so show only faint interest at first. You must haggle and firmly fix a fare in advance. Always write down the fare (with all the zeroes) and get an unequivocal \"okay\" from the driver. A 10-min ride (say from Hoan Kiem lake to Ho Chi Minh's tomb) should not exceed 20,000 dong; US dollars are often accepted. The driver has a second helmet for you.\nCommon scams here include (when you re-emerge from the tomb in reverent thought) claiming that you'd asked him to wait, that'll be two million dong please.\n\n\n==== By cyclo taxi ====\nNegotiate first or avoid using the cyclo services. At the end of the journey, a few men will come over to translate, and they will pretend to help and later insist that you pay the demanded amount.\n\n\n=== By car ===\nHanoi's traffic is extremely chaotic, with seemingly perpetual traffic jams, and a large number of almost suicidal motorcyclists, cyclists and pedestrians. Vietnamese drivers are among the most aggressive in the world, and lanes are effectively non-existent. As such, driving yourself around is not recommended, and you should leave your transportation needs in the hands of professionals.\n\n\n=== By motorbike ===\nSee also: Vietnam by motorcycle\nMotorcycles can be rented for around US$6\u20137 a day, and can be arranged by most hotels. This is good for making lots of trips around the city for individuals or duos, but be careful: Hanoi traffic is very difficult place to sharpen motorbike skills. Park on the pavement with other bikes, and be sure to lock the front wheel. Locals will help arrange the bikes near their stores. Many shops that have bike attendants will give you a ticket in exchange for parking your bike. This may or may not come with a fee. The ticket will either have your license plate number written on it, or the ticket itself will be numbered, with that number subsequently chalked somewhere on your bike. In such cases, where you've been given a ticket, the attendants may ask that you not lock the steering column or front wheel of your bike so that they can rearrange the bikes as customers come and go. Keep your ticket\u2014it is not heard of that people try to charge tourists twice. If you intend to go further out of the city, you may want to conceal this fact when renting the motorbike. Out-of-city rentals can be up to twice as expensive as the in-city charge, even if you rent longer since it takes you longer.\n\n\n=== By foot ===\nThis is the best way to traverse the maze of little streets in the old quarter and Hoan Kiem lakeside (which is traffic-free at weekends). From there it's a 1.5-km stroll to the Ho Chi Minh complex, 2 km to West Lake; follow usual local rules on traffic safety.\nOf the two bridges across the Red River, the southern (Ch\u01b0\u01a1ng D\u01b0\u01a1ng) is for vehicles only and has no sidewalk. The northern (Long Bi\u00ean) is for trains, bikes, motorbikes and pedestrians. This impressive century-old structure is almost 2 km long, and also serves a river islet of small plantations. It was a frequent target of bombing runs during the America-Vietnam War, but was rapidly repaired each time, becoming a national symbol of resilience. It is now a rusting hulk that would have been replaced long ago if not for its historical significance; the sidewalks are composed of thin concrete plates with slits that one can see the river below through. Walking across is not for the faint of heart.\n\n\n== See ==\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\n\n==== Near the city center ====\n1 Fine Arts Museum (B\u1ea3o T\u00e0ng M\u1ef9 Thu\u1eadt), 66 Nguyen Thai Hoc St (opposite Temple of Literature), \u260f +84 24 3733-2131. Daily 08:30-17:00. Only party-approved art is shown here with information in English and Vietnamese. On three floors of a colonial building, with another three galleries in the west wing. Pieces include soldiers on boats depicted on prehistoric bronze drums, Buddhist art, and revolutionary art of the 20th century wars. Also some interesting lacquer and silk paintings. Adult 40,000 dong.   (updated Dec 2018)\n2 H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh Mausoleum. Tu-Th Sa Su 08:00-11:30. The city down south may have his name, but only Hanoi has the man himself, entombed in distinctly Lenin-esque fashion. Against his wishes, but that's how it goes. No talking, revealing clothing (shorts should be knee length and no exposed shoulders), or other signs of disrespect allowed while viewing; photos are allowed only from outside, in the grand Ba Dinh Square. Purses are allowed into the tomb, but expect them to be searched by several bored soldiers along the way. Left luggage is handled in a complicated scheme: there is an office near the street for large bags, with separate windows for Vietnamese and foreigners, and a further office for cameras, which will be transported to a third office right outside the exit of the mausoleum. Items checked in at the first office, however, will stay there. The mausoleum is closed for a couple months around the end of the year, when the body is taken abroad for maintenance. It is closed in the afternoons for maintenance. Free.   (updated Aug 2018)\n3 H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh Museum, 19 Ngoc Ha St, Ba Dinh, \u260f +84 24 3846-3572, bthochiminh@hn.vnn.vn. Daily 08:00-11:30, and Tu-Th Sa Su 14:00-16:00. This gleaming white museum and its gloriously ham-handed iconography is the perfect chaser to the solemnity of the mausoleum. The building, completed in 1990, is intended to evoke a white lotus. Some photos and old letters are on display on the second floor, but the main exhibition space is on the third floor. It includes cars crashing through walls to represent the chaos of post-war American capitalism, soldiers charging around with bombs that looked like electric plugs, a cave hideout re-imagined as the inside of Ho Chi Minh's brain, and several other postmodern confections integrated with the detailed main story of the man's life and his country's struggle. There are plenty of photographs, prison documents and newspaper cuttings tracing his life along the way. The tour ends with a burnt bridge signifying the separation of Vietnam, followed by a reconstructed bridge showing the unification of Vietnam after the war. One of the more informative museums in Vietnam. Free guides are available in English, French, Chinese and Russian. The displays are labelled in English and French. 40,000 dong.   (updated May 2017)\n4 H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh's Vestige in the Presidential Palace Area, 1 Bach Thao, Ba Dinh, \u260f +84 4 0804 4529. Summer 07:30-11:00, 14:00-16:00; Winter 08:00-11:00, 13:30-16:00, closed M F afternoons. The exit from the mausoleum takes you right into the grounds of the, uh, vestige, where Ho Chi Minh lived and worked from 1954 until his death in 1969. The nicely landscaped complex includes Ho Chi Minh's two homes (one a small one-story house, the other a traditional stilt house), kept shiny and \"as he left them\" by the authorities, as well as a garage with two of Ho's presidential cars and a carp-filled pond. You also get to see Ho Chi Minh's work room and Politburo meeting room. The Presidential Palace is nearby, but it's not open to visitors. Pamphlets are available in English, Chinese, French and Korean. Guided tours are usually available if you wait. 40,000 dong.   (updated May 2017)\n\n5 National Museum of Vietnamese History (B\u1ea3o t\u00e0ng C\u00e1ch m\u1ea1ng Vi\u1ec7t Nam), No 1 Trang Tien Street and 216 Tran Quang Khai Street. Daily 08:00-12:00 and 13:30-17:00, except first Monday of month. Actually two museums: one covers Vietnam from prehistoric times to 1945 and the other covers 1945 to present. This museum gives a very informed and detailed account of the Vietnamese struggle against first the French (starting in 1858\u2014on the first floor), then against the US, ending on 30 Apr 1975 (on the ground floor). It is housed in a colonial French building which was completed in 1932. The building, designed by the architect Ernest H\u00e9brard is considered as a successful blend between the colonial French architecture and traditional Vietnamese architecture, called Indochina architecture. He created double-walls and balconies for a natural ventilation system and protection from sunshine. 40,000 dong for both.   (updated Aug 2018)\n6 Vietnamese Women's Museum (B\u1ea3o T\u00e0ng Ph\u1ee5 n\u1eef Vi\u1ec7t Nam), 36 Ly Thuong Kiet St, Hoan Kiem District (Central Hanoi, 1 km S of Hoan Kiem Lake), \u260f +84 24 3825-9938, fax: +84 24 3825-9129, info@baotangphunu.org.vn. Daily 08:00-17:00. This often overlooked museum has benefited from an extensive renovation of its permanent exhibitions. The modernised interior is well laid out with information in Vietnamese, English and French, and contains a huge amount of information on the fearsome female heroines of Vietnamese history. There are also exhibitions on the rituals and traditions surrounding women in family, as well as a beautifully presented collection of intricate hand-made ethnic costumes. A highlight is the regularly updated special exhibitions on a diverse range of subjects, from contemporary issues such as single mothers and street vendors to traditional medicine and Mother Goddess worship. English language tours are available on request. 40,000 dong (80,000 dong with audioguide).   (updated Feb 2025)\n\n\n==== Further out ====\n\n7 Vietnam Military History Museum (B\u1ea3o t\u00e0ng L\u1ecbch s\u1eed Qu\u00e2n s\u1ef1 Vi\u1ec7t Nam), Km6+500, CT03, T\u00e2y M\u1ed7 Ward, Nam T\u1eeb Li\u00eam Dist, \u260f +84 24 6253 1367. Tu-Th Sa Su 08:00-11:30 & 13:00-16:30; closed M F. Originally a modest museum located next to the Flag Tower, the Military History Museum and all its 150,000 artifacts has been relocated in 2024 to an enormous 39-hectare compound in the city's outskirts, 12 km from its original location. Now the largest and most modern museum in all of Vietnam, the imposing main building covers the country's military history extending back some two millennia. All museum exhibits and videos are captioned in Vietnamese and English. The vast courtyard houses dozens of military vehicles, aircraft and artillery; many of which are French, American and South Vietnamese assets captured in the Indochina wars. Extremely popular with locals, the museum is usually completely packed on weekends, with dozens of tour buses ferrying out-of-town visitors to the site. Peak queuing times can exceed an hour as a result, so try to visit early on a weekday if possible; give the museum a call beforehand to check how busy it is. Entry fee 40,000 dong; free for under-16s, over-80s, soldiers, veterans, military academy cadets and contributors to the Revolution.   (updated May 2025)\n8 Museum of Ethnology (B\u1ea3o t\u00e0ng D\u00e2n t\u1ed9c h\u1ecdc Vi\u1ec7t Nam), Nguyen Van Huyen St, Cau Giay District (Bus 14 from Hoan Kiem Lake - ask the conductor when to stop, and take a 500 m walk towards the museum (backtrack a little from the bus stop, and when you see a large street perpendicular to the street that you dropped off, take that street and walk down the street until you see the Museum of Ethnology to your left). Bus 38 goes from right outside the Temple of Literature to the street the museum is on). Tu-Su 08:30-17:30. Exhibitions cover mainly the culture and ritual practices of the various ethnic groups in the whole of Vietnam. One of the key attractions of the museum is the open-air exhibition, which has reconstructions of traditional houses from multiple ethnic groups, which even comes with inhabitants in costumes. The museum features actual explanations of the exhibits in Vietnamese, French and English. There is an excellent caf\u00e9 on the premises. 40,000 dong for foreigners, extra 50,000 dong for photography..   (updated Aug 2018)\n9 Hanoi Museum (B\u1ea3o t\u00e0ng H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i), Pham Hung St, Cau Giay District. Tu-Su 08:00-11:30 & 13:30-17:00. Local natural and human history down the ages. Free.   (updated Jan 2019)\n10 Air Force Museum (B\u1ea3o T\u00e0ng Kh\u00f4ng Qu\u00e2n), Truong Chinh St (SW of city centre). There's a UH-1 helicopter, Soviet-built MiG fighters, a huge Mi-6 helicopter and other aircraft. Unfortunately they've been exposed to the elements for some time and local children climb over them.   \n\n\n=== Parks ===\n11 Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm Lake. A pleasant park in the centre of town, an easy walk from anywhere in the Old Quarter. This is the locals' favorite leisure spot; especially during weekends, when the lakeside streets are closed to traffic and becomes a pedestrian-only area. A great place to watch people practising tai chi in the morning or to sit and read in the afternoon. At weekends the park becomes even more popular as the normally busy road around it is pedestrianised, and instead filled with children driving electric cars or riding hoverboards. Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm means \"returned sword\", and the name comes from a legend in which King L\u00ea L\u1ee3i was given a magical sword by the gods, which he used to drive out the invading Chinese. Later, while boating on the lake, he encountered a giant turtle, which grabbed the sword and carried it down to its depths, returning it to the gods from whom it had come. (You can see a version of the legend at the Water Puppet Theatre.) The giant soft-shell turtles, whom Vietnamese biologists assigned to a separate species, Rafetus leloii, resided in the lake until the early 21st century. One of them, who died in 1968, has been preserved by the wonders of taxidermy, and can be viewed in a glass box (sarcophagus?) in a pavilion adjacent to Ng\u1ecdc S\u01a1n Temple on the island in the lake. Park is free; 30,000 dong admission to the island temple (\u7389\u5c71\u7960)..   (updated Mar 2025)\n12 L\u00fd Th\u00e1i T\u1ed5 Statue & Park (SE corner of lake). The park faces Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm lake, with a beautiful view of the busy Hang Bai St. and the serenity of the willows on the bank of the lake. Many locals view this mini-park as their favourite place because it is a symbol of the integration of modernity and tradition. One might encounter a group of youths practising hip-hop, breakdancing, or playing foot-badminton, while at the same time seeing a three-generation family enjoying a walk in the park. (updated May 2017)\n13 H\u1ed3 T\u00e2y (West Lake) (NW of the city). Mostly a residential hub of the well-to-do. The InterContinental West Lake, Sheraton Hanoi and Pan Pacific Hanoi are on this lake front.   \n14 Lenin Statue & Park (Dien Bien Phu St, across from the Army Museum). You can always feel the diversity and liveliness of Hanoi here. In the morning, there are low-energy aerobics class for elders and aerobics class for the young in the morning. During the day, one can enjoy the tranquility in the park since everybody is either at work or in school. In the afternoon, it becomes a playground for children, students, soccer teams, and badminton players.   \n\n\n=== Temples ===\n\n15 One-Pillar Pagoda (tucked away between the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum and Museum). Visitors find this either charming and lovely or utterly pointless, depending on how many tour groups are crammed into the small grounds at the time of their visit. It has a long history attached to it. Regarded as one of Vietnam's iconic temples, it was built by Emperor L\u00fd Th\u00e1i T\u00f4ng. The emperor was childless and dreamt that he met the bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara, who handed him a baby son while seated on a lotus flower. He then married a peasant girl that he had met and she bore him a son. The emperor constructed the temple in gratitude for this in 1049 having been told by a monk to build the temple, by erecting a pillar in the middle of a lotus pond, similar to the one he saw in the dream. Before the pagoda was opened, prayers were held for the longevity of the monarch. The temple is built of wood on a single stone pillar 1.25 m in diameter, and it is designed to resemble a lotus blossom, which is a Buddhist symbol of purity, since a lotus blossoms in a muddy pond. In 1954, the French Union forces destroyed the pagoda before withdrawing from Vietnam after the First Indochina War, it was rebuilt afterwards. Free.   (updated May 2017)\n16 Ng\u1ecdc S\u01a1n Temple (\u7389\u5c71\u5bfa). Located on a small island in the Hoan Kiem Lake, connected with the mainland by a bridge. With small but attractive grounds, the temple displays on Vietnamese history and, more memorably, displays on the giant turtles, including a mummified specimen (who died in 1968). The two on-site gift shops vend a variety of souvenirs, many of them turtle-themed. Entry fee: 50.000 Dong   (updated Jan 2025)\n17 Temple of Literature (V\u0103n Mi\u1ebfu / \u6587\u5e99), Qu\u1ed1c T\u1eed Gi\u00e1m St (a few blocks south of the Ho Chi Minh mausoleum). Daily 08:00-18:00. The Temple was founded in 1070 and became the country's first university six years later. The overall design is somewhat similar to the \"original\" Confucian Temple in Qufu, with 5 courtyards. Most of the architecture is named with titles indicating reverence to literature and language. The showpiece of the complex is the third courtyard with eighty-odd stone tablets, each mounted on the back of a tortoise (known as bixi in Chinese), inscribed with the names of graduates. Another courtyard is full of gift shops, which also sell stamps, coins, and books. A reduced-size replica of the famous giant softshell turtle (the original being at the Ngoc Son Temple at the Lake of the Returned Sword) can be seen in one of the pavilions as well; it was made by Vietnamese artisans out of ceramic, and gold-plated. The fourth courtyard contains a temple and statues devoted to Confucius and his four disciples. The fifth and last courtyard, which was destroyed by the French in 1946 and rebuilt in 2000, contains a mini-museum showcasing information on Emperor L\u00fd Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng and his successors who built and renovated the temple. You may find a Vietnamese band playing local instrumental music in front of this museum. There are explanatory wall-hangings in English and French all along the way, and you don't need a guide. Adult 30,000 dong; student, senior or disabled person 15,000 dong; child under 15 free.   (updated Apr 2020)\n18 Qu\u00e1n S\u1ee9 Pagoda (Ch\u00f9a Qu\u00e1n S\u1ee9), 73 P. Qu\u00e1n S\u1ee9.

Thanh Ni\u00ean, Tr\u00fac B\u1ea1ch, T\u00e2y H\u1ed3. The oldest Buddhist temple in Hanoi, on an island near the southeastern shore of West Lake.   (updated Jan 2024)\n\n\n==== Four Sacred Temples ====\nThe Four Sacred Temples (Th\u0103ng Long T\u1ee9 Tr\u1ea5n) were built at the four cardinal points of the Imperial City of Th\u0103ng Long to guard it from evil spirits. Although most of the city wall is long gone, all four temples survive to this day.\n\n20 B\u1ea1ch M\u00e3 Temple (\u0110\u1ec1n B\u1ea1ch M\u00e3), 76 Hang Buom St, Hoan Kiem District. The eastern temple, dedicated to Long \u0110\u1ed7, the th\u00e0nh ho\u00e0ng (city god) of Th\u0103ng Long (now H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i), and represented in the temple as a white horse (B\u1ea1ch M\u00e3 in Vietnamese, hence its name).  \n21 Qu\u00e1n Th\u00e1nh Temple (\u0110\u1ec1n Qu\u00e1n Th\u00e1nh), \u0110. Thanh Ni\u00ean, Qu\u00e1n Th\u00e1nh, Ba \u0110\u00ecnh. The northern temple, dedicated to the Taoist god Xuanwu, known in Vietnamese as Tr\u1ea5n V\u0169, with a large bronze statue of him at the main altar.   \n22 Voi Ph\u1ee5c Temple (\u0110\u1ec1n Voi Ph\u1ee5c), 306B Kim Ma St, Ngoc Khanh Ward, Ba Dinh District. The western temple, dedicated to Prince Linh Lang, a son of King L\u00fd Th\u00e1i T\u00f4ng and his 9th concubine D\u01b0\u01a1ng Th\u1ecb Quang, who was killed in action at the Battle of Nh\u01b0 Nguy\u1ec7t River in a war with China's Song Dynasty. The name Voi Ph\u1ee5c means \"kneeling elephant\", and you can see two statues of elephants in a kneeling position at the front of the temple, hence its name.  \n23 Kim Li\u00ean Shrine (\u0110\u1ec1n Kim Li\u00ean), 148 P. Kim Hoa, Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng Li\u00ean, \u0110\u1ed1ng \u0110a.

They had been converted into schools for local children and long been hidden behind unsightly walls and fences, but were painstaking restored to their former glory in the 2010s.\n\n24 Fujian Assembly Hall (H\u1ed9i Qu\u00e1n Ph\u00fac Ki\u1ebfn / \u798f\u5efa\u6703\u9928), 40 P. L\u00e3n \u00d4ng. Former assembly hall of the Chinese from Fujian province.

H\u00e0ng Bu\u1ed3m. Former assembly hall of the Chinese from Guangdong province. It was converted to a kindergarten after the 1979 Sino-Vietnamese War, but was restored to its former glory in 2021, and is now an exhibition space open to the public. \n\n\n=== Miscellaneous ===\n26 Hanoi Citadel. Built as a residence for the Vietnamese king, the citadel was mostly destroyed by the French, used as a military headquarters during the Vietnam War. It is now a  UNESCO World Heritage Site as \"Central Sector of the Imperial Citadel of Thang Long - Hanoi\".   \n Hanoi Train Street. Buildings press up nearly to the railroad ties of the railway through central Hanoi, creating a narrow corridor for trains to pass through. Two stretches of rail corridor, just to the north and the south of Hanoi Station, are lined by restaurants and cafes. Several times a day, trains quickly pass close to the cafe seating. You'll have to buy a coffee, juice or a beer, but prices are reasonable. Safety concerns prompt occasional closures. \n27 Hanoi Train Street (North), 5 Tr\u1ea7n Ph\u00fa, H\u00e0ng B\u00f4ng, Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm. Because of stupid tourists posing for selfies in front of oncoming trains, there are now police posted at the entrance to order people away. Cafe owners can bring you in through passageways nearby, however, so wander around to look for an invitation. Trains pass around 15:00 and 19:00 daily.

Built by the French in 1886, the exterior is gaunt and grey, but the interior is light and peaceful. Mass is held several times a day, and for Sunday evening mass at 18:00 the crowds are huge: the service is broadcast to those outside who can't get in. Major renovation works to maintain the cathedral's structural integrity and restore its exterior paintwork were completed in 2022.   (updated Mar 2025)\n30 Presidential Palace, 2 H\u00f9ng V\u01b0\u01a1ng, Ng\u1ecdc H\u1ed3, Ba \u0110\u00ecnh. Completed in 1906 as the residence of the French Governor-General of Indochina. It became the official residence of the President of North Vietnam following independence in 1954, and later of the President of Vietnam following reunification in 1975. Ho Chi Minh was said to have refused to live in the palace for symbolic reasons, though he used it to receive state guests. The building is not open to the public, but you can view it from the outside and take photographs.   \n\n\n=== Wartime sites ===\n31 B-52 Lake (Huu Tiep Lake), Ngoc Ha Precinct, Ba Dinh District. Until 19 Dec 1972, this was just a small brackish pond just off Ho\u00e0ng Hoa Th\u00e1m St., about 1 km west of the mausoleum. On that day, in a twisted retelling of the Hoan Kiem legend, Vietnamese anti-aircraft missiles blasted the enemy's eight-engine, 100-ton aircraft and sent it to the shallow bottom of the lake, where it remains today. \n\n32 Downed Aircraft Memorial (Along Thanh Nien St on Truc Bach Lake).

Daily 08:30-12:00, 14:00-16:30 (M & F from 08:00). This prison was built by the French at the turn of the 20th century, in classical French prison design. Two thirds of the prison was torn down to make way for the Hanoi Towers, and the rest was converted into a museum. This is where the French imprisoned and executed Vietnamese freedom fighters. The museum exhibits the plight of jailed political revolutionaries under the French colonial regime and the struggle of the Vietnamese people against imperialism in chilling detail. Later, during the America-Vietnam War, the prison held US prisoners of war that sarcastically referred to it as the \"Hanoi Hilton\". This period is not emphasized, except to present the official narrative of how humanely the POWs were treated, such as showing photos only of prisoners being treated well and playing basketball and playing chess. The museum claims to have the flight suit of John McCain, the most notable POW held here, from when his plane was shot down. Most of the exhibits have detailed English information, but you can also get an audioguide for 50,000 dong. 50,000 dong.   \n\n\n== Do ==\nFlavors of Hanoi, 25 Hang Be, Hoan Kiem, Hanoi, \u260f +84 967 258 586, \u2709 hello@flavorsofhanoi.com. 09:00-21:00.

H\u00e1t tu\u1ed3ng is often referred to as classical \"Vietnamese opera\" influenced by Chinese opera which combines acting, singing, and dancing. Tu\u1ed3ng employs the use of stock characters who are recognizable from their make-up and costumes, which are typically very elaborate and extravagant. Usually, a character's personalities can be revealed through three features: the color of the face, the eyebrows, and the beard.In this 1 hour show, the artists will perform most interesting, unique and typical recitals from famous Tuongs (which typically last 1-2 hours). The show starts at 18:00 but from 17:30 the theater is open so the guests can interact with the artists, observe the performance preparation and try to sing, dance, play drum with the artists and enjoy traditional royal tea.

Th Sa 18:00-18:45, 19:30-20:15. \"Four Palaces\u201d refers to the belief in the worship of Four Mother Goddesses, including Mother Goddess of Heaven, Mother Goddess of Forest, Mother Goddess of Water and Mother Goddess of Earth.The late 19th and early 20th centuries were the most flourishing periods of Mother Goddess religion in Viet folklore. There are times when Mother Goddess religion is considered as a manifestation of superstition and thus prohibited. However, the rituals of \u201cT\u1ee9 Ph\u1ee7\u201d (Four Palaces), known by several other names, for instance, T\u1ee9 Ph\u1ee7 C\u00f4ng \u0110\u1ed3ng or Four Palaces Council, h\u00e1t v\u0103n, ch\u1ea7u th\u00e1nh, etc., still have a remarkable presence and strong reflection in Viet folk arts for several reasons:1. Four Palaces is considered as a medium of lively communication of humans with Gods or Saints, divine beings who are familiar to Vietnamese both spiritually and in real life. The communications are organized as rituals by psychics or mediums who play roles of middlemen connecting people to divines. As such, it connected with Vietnamese in general.2. Four Palaces is a lively form of art which collected many materials of folk arts, for example, h\u00e1t ch\u1ea7u v\u0103n or ch\u1ea7u th\u00e1nh (a traditional folk art which combines trance singing and dancing) and rites (ceremonies) as well as music with drum, flute and folk instruments; ritual dancing, rites of h\u1ea7u \u0111\u1ed3ng (hi\u1ec3n th\u00e1nh) or ritual dress of sorceresses, etc. You can buy ticket online via website. USD5.49-12.95. (updated Sep 2018)\n Hanoi Ch\u00e8o Theatre (Show \"Long Thanh Dien Xuong\"), 1 Giang V\u0103n Minh (across street from Kim Son Pagoda), \u260f +84 24 3845-7403. Th 17:30-18:30. Ch\u00e8o (Vietnamese: [c\u025b\u0302w]) is a form of generally satirical musical theatre, often encompassing dance, traditionally performed by Vietnamese peasants in northern Vietnam. It is usually performed outdoors by semi-amateur touring groups, stereotypically in a village square or the courtyard of a public building, although it is today increasingly also performed indoors and by professional performers. Ch\u00e8o stage art is one of the great cultural heritage of the Vietnamese folk treasure. Ch\u00e8o has been a popular art form of the Vietnamese people for many generations and has fostered the national spirit through its lyrical content. Show Long Thanh Dien Xuong introduces to the visitors different types of folk arts/performances which used to be common in the history, when Hanoi was the royal capital of Viet Kingdom: cheo, ca tru, chau van, xam, water puppet. 150,000 dong. (updated Sep 2018)\n1 Hanoi Opera House, 01 Tr\u00e0ng Ti\u1ec1n, hnopera@hanoioperahouse.org.vn. Built by the French during the colonial period, today it usually hosts classical music concerts and local Vietnamese plays and pop concerts rather than operas.   \n\n\n== Buy ==\n\n\n=== Money ===\nMoney exchange can be done at jewellery shops, which usually offer better rates than banks. The most popular ones are located along Ha Trung Rd (5-min walk from Hoan Kiem Lake) and Hang Bac. Just walk into the shop and ask them if they change money. Ask 5 or more shops to see which one gives the best rate. Hotels also often provide currency exchange service, but at terrible rates. Don't exchange money with people in the street, as the risk of getting counterfeit notes from them is high.\n\n\n=== Markets ===\n Ch\u1ee3 H\u00f4m (The equivalent meaning in English would be \"Evening Market\"), Pho Hue. A huge range of goods, and famous for the fabric market on the second floor. There are many kiosks selling different types of fabrics ranging from cheap, affordable to best quality with a high price. When shopping, take your time and never rush into buying anything. Sellers often quote a very high price that you can bargain down considerably. (updated Jul 2024)\n1 Ch\u1ee3 \u0110\u1ed3ng Xu\u00e2n. Famous for being the market for wholesalers. They have school supplies, stuffed animals, clothing. It is quite an experience to spend some time in the market observing the sellers and buyers.   (updated Apr 2025)\n Ch\u1ee3 H\u00e0ng Da. A 6-storey building to house the market is under construction. All the kiosks are now in the neighbouring area, either on Ph\u00f9ng H\u01b0ng (second-hand clothing), \u0110\u01b0\u1eddng Th\u00e0nh, or L\u00fd Nam \u0110\u1ebf Streets. Sell a huge range of goods including pets, groceries, prepared foods and fabrics. It is now mostly empty. (updated Aug 2018)\n Night Market. Weekends from 19:00. The major north-south street in the Old Quarter, from Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm Lake almost to the train overpass, becomes a crowded walking street with everything from pirated DVDs to traditional ornaments. Prices are negotiable, but \"foreigner pricing\" is fairly common. Thankfully many shops nowadays offer fixed prices with big \"no bargaining\" signs. \n\n\n=== Bookstores ===\n Bookworm Hanoi, 44 Chau Long (Hanoi Cooking Center), \u260f +84 24 3715-3711, +84 912 561 800. New and used books. \nSmall Vietnamese bookstores (nh\u00e0 s\u00e1ch) line Ph\u1ed1 \u0110inh L\u1ec5 St, just south of the large post office east of Hoan Kiem Lake. Most of them stock a variety of bilingual dictionaries, but hardly any books in English. Among them, as of 2016, Nh\u00e0 S\u00e1ch Lam seemed to have the best selection of maps (both Hanoi City and Vietnam regional).\nMost of the numerous souvenir shops inside the Temple of Literature (see under Museums; admission fee needs to be paid to get in) also carry a selection of books about Vietnam in English and other foreign languages (French, Spanish, Japanese), as well as culture- and history-oriented books in Vietnamese. Not a good place to shop for dictionaries or maps, though.\n\n\n=== Supermarkets ===\nAlthough most grocery shopping still happens in street markets (see above), supermarkets and convenience stores are becoming more common. As well as local mid-level and luxury brands, many supermarkets stock imported products such as California pistachios and almonds, European cheese, chocolates and wine, Korean kim chi, or Japanese seaweed snacks. Consumer staples, such as fresh produce or tofu may be considerably more expensive than in traditional markets.\n\nVinmart is a fast growing chain of convenience stores and by far the most common brand in Hanoi, offering a selection of fresh products (including the \"clean\" Vineco range with less pesticides) as well as the staples you'd expect at similar stores worldwide. Western goods importer L's Place has a few branches, including one just south of the Hoa Lo prison on Ly Thuong Kiet and focuses on the expat market.\nAeon Fivimart is a large supermarket with a central branch east of Hoan Kiem Lake (27A Ly Thai To, at Tran Nguyen Han). The similarly named but separately owned Aeon Citimart is in Hanoi Towers on the site of the former Hoa Lo prison. Meanwhile, the huge but further afield Lotte Mart, located in the basement of the Lotte Center (Hanoi's second-tallest building; at the corner of \u0110\u00e0o T\u1ea5n and Li\u1ec5u Giai, a few blocks south of West Lake - the word \"Lotte\" on the tower makes it easy to find), may be one of the best of the breed, with a good bakery and cafeteria section. Open 08:00-22:00.\nIf you've a particular desire to spend double the usual price on a selection of boutique imported Western goods (French Comte cheese, Iberico ham, British ale), Annam Gourmet have a store in the Syrena Centre at 51 Xu\u00e2n Di\u1ec7u St. in T\u00e2y H\u1ed3. Largest selection of imported cheeses in town.\n\n\n=== Discriminatory pricing ===\nMost shops quote much higher prices for tourists (including Vietnamese people from other regions) than for locals, and the belief that tourists are rich and hence should pay more than locals is firmly entrenched in the local culture. As such, most vendors will insist that as a tourist, you pay the tourist price and will refuse to let you bargain the price down to the local price even if you know what it is. If you have a trusted local friend, you can save a fair bit of money by getting your friend to buy the item you want in your absence.\n\n\n== Eat ==\nHanoi's most famous (and prevalent) dish is ph\u1edf soup: \"ph\u1edf g\u00e0\" (chicken noodle soup), \"ph\u1edf b\u00f2\" (beef noodle soup), or \"ph\u1edf chay\" (tofu noodle soup). Another local specialty is b\u00fan ch\u1ea3, grilled fatty pork over a plate of white rice noodles and herbs with dipping sauce.\nThere are hundreds of street restaurants in small kiosks on the sidewalk, with plastic tables and chairs on the pavement. Eating at these restaurants is a great way to experience the local food and culture. It is worth mentioning that food quality, freshness, and hygiene can vary greatly. On average, a bowl of noodle soup goes for 40-60,000 dong (June 2024) and market food stalls offer fruit portions, sausages, doughnuts and other foods. Check your change as a few vendors seem to forget to give it, and learn a little Vietnamese because vendors often will not speak any or much English (e.g. \"bao nhi\u00eau ?\", meaning \"how much?\").\n\n\n=== Exotic treats ===\nNext to Beijing, Hanoi is probably the second in the running to the world's exotic food paradise.\n\n Snake Restaurants (about ten minutes across the river from the city centre, take Bus 10, 15 or 17 and get off at the large mall\" just beyond Gia L\u00e2m station, and walk 500 m down the road at the right of the mall). The suburb of Le Mat (aka Snake Village) has numerous restaurants specializing in cobra foodstuffs. Live cobras are stored on the premises much the same way one would find live lobsters at a Western seafood restaurant. If one orders cobra blood wine from the menu, the waiter will take a live cobra, kill it on the spot, drain the blood into a shot glass of rice wine and top it off with the cobra's still beating heart for you to gulp down. Not for animal lovers or the ecologically-minded. Cobras are not cheap, but one snake becomes a dozen unique dishes, and enough to share between 3-4 people. R\u01b0\u1ee3u r\u1eafn is cobra steeped whole in rice wine \u2013 or, especially in tourist areas, perhaps a cheaper, non-poisonous snake with similar coloring whose body has been stretched to give it the expected shape.  Carefully investigate customs restrictions before deciding to bring a few bottles home, as some of the snakes used are endangered species. \nA local delicacy in the Hanoi area is dog meat (th\u1ecbt ch\u00f3), which is especially popular in the winter. There are a number of dog restaurants in the Tay Ho district. Another exotic regional taste is c\u00e0 cu\u1ed1ng, an extract from the belostomatid or giant water bug. Just a few drops are added to noodles for the unique aroma.\nBoiled duck foetus eggs (tr\u1ee9ng v\u1ecbt l\u1ed9n) are sold by pedlars almost everywhere. The experience consists of the vendor cracking the egg in front of you, and peeling the shell and dropping the contents in a plastic bowl, then garnished with julienned ginger, Vietnamese coriander (rau r\u0103m) and sprinkled with chili sauce. You can see the severed head and beak of your chick that fell off if you are lucky enough to have your first bite from a different spot.\n\n\n=== Street Food ===\n\n\n==== Around the Beer Street ====\n1 B\u00e1nh M\u00ec D\u00e2n T\u1ed5, 32 \u0110. Tr\u1ea7n Nh\u1eadt Du\u1eadt. The sandwich is very delicious and crispy. Pretty crowded. You can also eat there at 3am and it will feel delicious.

Delicious and nutritious rice, clean restaurant. (updated Apr 2022)\n\n\n==== Around the Hoan Kiem Lake ====\n7 B\u00fan Ch\u1ea3 \u0110\u1eafc Kim, 1 Hang Manh (Old Quarter near Hang Da Market), \u260f +84 915 177 766, +84 24 3828-5022, +84 16 9777 6666. 08:00-19:00. Some rate this as one of the best examples of b\u00fan ch\u1ea3 in Hanoi, and therefore Vietnam (apparently in the south, b\u00fan ch\u1ea3 is specifically advertised as Hanoi-style). For 100,000 dong each, you'll get a bowl full of tiny minced-pork rissoles that have been chargrilled over an open flame and a massive plate of pork rice paper rolls that have been fried in oil twice. You also get a phenomenal dipping sauce (fish sauce, made from sugar, garlic, peppers usually), a massive plate of greens and herbs and more bun (rice noodle) than you can handle. It is now more touristy than it used to be. Great food, but expect rude service. There is another 8 B\u00fan Ch\u1ea3 \u0110\u1eafc Kim in 67 \u0110\u01b0\u1eddng Th\u00e0nh. \n9 Pho 10 Ly Quoc Su, 10 P. L\u00fd Qu\u1ed1c S\u01b0 (On the corner of Nha Chung and Chan Cam). Serve delicious beef rice noodle, fried bread stick is crispy and delicious. The place is so clean and nice. All of the soups and sides include beef (bo), so this isn't for vegetarians. (updated Aug 2022)\n10 Pho Tu Lun (Au Trieu), 34 P. \u1ea4u Tri\u1ec7u. Many pho varieties. Store is only open in the morning. Locals crowd the place, so you know it must be good.

Daily: 10:00-14:00, 17:00-21:00. A kitschy throwback to Vietnam's impoverished subsidy era, emulating the government-subsidised eateries of the 1970s; the interior is lined from top to bottom with period artifacts, while food is served in historically-accurate cheap tin bowls. A tad pricier than what you'd expect for such rustic food, but the overall experience makes up for it. Order the signature c\u01a1m ch\u00e1y m\u1eafm t\u00e9p (scorched rice with shrimp paste) and t\u00f3p m\u1ee1 (pork crackling). 100-200k dong per person.

Excellent choice for first-time visitors who want authentic home-style cooking in a more upscale dining space. Inexplicably awarded a Michelin star in 2023 despite not at all being a fine dining destination, but forget about the star and you'll have a good time. To the restaurant's credit, their low prices have remained mostly unchanged since; but prior reservations are now essential. 200-300k dong per person.

(updated Jul 2021)\n\n\n=== Sweet ===\n Kem Tr\u00e0ng Ti\u1ec1n, 54 Ph\u1ed1 Tr\u00e0ng Ti\u1ec1n. Popular spot for ice cream on a hot day. Beware of motorbikes when entering the establishment, since it is sort of a drive-thru/drive-in ice cream shop. Recommended is the local c\u00f3m or \u0111\u1eadu xanh flavours. \n\n\n== Drink ==\nBia h\u01a1i is abundant in the streets of the Old Quarter. At the crossing of Ta Hien and Luong Ngoc Quyen, commonly known as Beer Street, five separate venues fill up with travellers in the evenings. You can get more local atmosphere on some of the side streets.\nHanoi is a lively city on the weekends, but the Old Quarter closes relatively early (at midnight) on weekdays, so you might want to start your night early. Other places outside the Old Quarter stay open later and vary in closing times. Local young people gather around the cathedral located in Ly Quoc Su to have lemon ice tea (tra chanh) and sunflower seeds in street bars. After dark it gets quite crowded.\nSit on a plastic chair in front of one of the bia hoi (fresh beer) establishments which are invariably on the corners of many of Hanoi's Old Quarter streets. This preservative-free light beer is the perfect drink to sip as you watch the city's frenetic bustle. The beer costs less than 5,000 dong and gives you an excuse to relax and take photos of the passing local characters: should not be missed. In the Old Quarter, you will find that almost every corner is filled with stalls selling pho (Vietnamese noodle) and cafe (the name is not limited only to coffee, but also tea, sweets and grocery items, and even to pho).\nOn T\u00f4 Tich, a small street connecting Hang Quat and Hang Gai, you can help yourself to a refreshing fruit milkshake (sinh t\u1ed1) at one of the stalls.\n\n\n=== Breweries ===\nIf you are looking for something less watery than Bia Hoi, excellent freshly brewed Czech or German-style beer is available at several breweries, including: Hoa Vien (Czech), Goldmalt (Czech), Legend beer (German), with several branches around the city; prices are around 45,000-60,000 dong for 0.5 L. The craft beer revolution that's been simmering in Ho Chi Minh City since 2014 has been slow to reach Hanoi, but a few breweries are now coming online, although prices are higher still and 100,000 dong might not even get you 0.5 L.\n\n Hoa Vien. (updated Jun 2015)\n Goldmalt. (updated Jun 2015)\n Legend Beer. (updated Jun 2015)\n Furbrew, 8b, Ngo 52 To Ngoc Van. 16:00-23:00. Danish-owned, Danish-style craft brewery. 80,000-100,000 dong/beer. (updated Feb 2017)\n\n\n=== Bars ===\n Green Lake (Ho Guom Xanh), 32 Le Thai To. A crowded bar with weekly performances by popular local singers. A place for the definitive Vietnamese entertainment scene. Has a cover charge on the weekends. Seems to combine part live singing with drag performances and a host club. \n Mao's Red Lounge, 30 Ta Hien, Hoan Kiem (down the street from Tet and Cheeky Quarter). Small, but lively bar in the heart of the Old Quarter. Has two levels, the top floor which is usually packed with Westerners smoking loads of cigarettes. Mao himself is usually in presence, playing all kinds of music from his iPod. He's extremely friendly and will strike up a conversation with anyone willing to listen. \n Minh's Jazz Club, 1 Trang Tien, Ha Noi (alley behind the opera house). This longtime institution of the Hanoi music scene is still run by the same Mr Quyen Van Minh. It seems to move venue every couple of years, so worth checking in advance. In 2015 it was in an alley behind the opera house. No cover charge, beers get more expensive (around 75,000 dong) shortly before the music starts at 21:00, but cocktails are the same price (around 100,000 dong). Offers food. (updated Oct 2015)\n Standing Bar, 170 Tr\u1ea5n V\u0169, Tr\u00fac B\u1ea1ch. 16:00-00:00. Wide variety of Vietnamese craft beer, mostly from the south, but with a limited selection from the local Long Bien brewery. Despite the name, seats are available upstairs. (updated Feb 2017)\n1 Top of Hanoi, 54 Li\u1ec5u Giai St., Ba \u0110\u00ecnh, \u260f +84 24 3333-3016, topofhanoi@lotte.net. 17:00-00:00. Large outdoor rooftop bar & brasserie on the Lotte Center's 65th floor, with 128 seats. One of the highest bars in the world at 272 m, with commanding 360-degree views of the entire city, live DJs on Tu-Su, and open kitchen. Best visited at sunset for Golden Hour ambiance; can get quite chilly at night due to high altitude, especially during winter, so bring outerwear if necessary. Noticeably pricier than the average bar, as to be expected. (updated Aug 2021)\n\n\n=== Coffee ===\nThe usual Vietnamese coffee is widely available in Hanoi, but make sure you also try the local specialty C\u00e0 Ph\u00ea Tr\u1ee9ng (egg coffee), coffee topped with a foam of egg yolks whipped with sugar and condensed milk.\n\n Highlands Coffee (opposite KFC). On the 3rd floor in a ship-shaped 5-storey building (which is about to be demolished, so be quick) overlooking Hoan Kiem Lake and Vietnam's \"Piccadilly Circus\". Great spot to relax in scenic location where you can watch all the traffic and pedestrians go about their business below you along their outside balcony or stay inside their comfy air conditioned interior. They also serve food and beer. \n Cong Caphe. Several locations across the city, although the most central is probably the one at 54 Ma May. Serves various coffees, chocolates and teas including their speciality coconut coffee smoothie (around 45,000 dong). Popular with a young and relatively hip but well off crowd, and open late. (updated Oct 2015)\n\n\n== Sleep ==\n\n\n=== Budget ===\nSee common scams; they're more prevalent at the budget end of the market, but no more in Hanoi than in other cities. \n\n\n==== Old Quarter North of Hoan Kiem Lake ====\nThe heart of the Old Quarter - potentially noisy and busy - but closest to the bars on Ma May and Ta Hien.

(updated Aug 2021)\n\n\n== Stay safe ==\n\n\n=== Traffic ===\nThe simple act of walking can be intimidating, especially in the narrow streets around the Old Quarter. As is the case everywhere in Vietnam, traffic in Hanoi is dominated by an incredible number of motorbikes, all of which seem to be making a mad, desperate dash for something just out of reach, all of the time. There is no such thing as one-directional traffic in Vietnam.\nWhen you leave the curb, look not only left and right, but to the front and back. Even up and down would not be amiss. Take each step deliberately but resolutely. Patiently allow the motorbikes to pass. Don't rush and don't make any erratic movements. Stop in place if necessary but never walk backwards. This way the drivers are aware of you, and can anticipate your behavior (along with all of the other motorbikes). As a rule of thumb, motorbikes will swerve around you, but cars and trucks will run you over.  It may look chaotic, but be patient and pay attention and you'll be fine.\n\n\n=== Hustles and scams ===\nBe vigilant when taking a taxi. Drivers have been known to jump out at the destination and remove most of the bags from the trunk. While the passenger is busy putting on a rucksack the driver takes off with the remaining bags. Ask your hotel what taxi companies are reliable.\nBe careful of hustler hawkers. In Vietnam, there is a two-tier pricing system, for locals and for foreigners. No other place in Vietnam is this practised more emphatically than in Hanoi (and in Ho Chi Minh City's Ben Thanh Market) where vendors charge differently according to how they gauge your net worth.\n\n\n=== Pickpockets ===\nYou've read warnings about pickpockets a hundred times, but it's rarely as true as for Hanoi's busy and narrow Old Quarter or the Dong Xuan Night Market. The crowd, the loads of tourists, the distraction of heavy traffic and the narrow confines guarantee opportunities for thieves. And the general belief that tourists have too much money creates a moral climate in which thieves abound. Even if you're attentive, you'll get some pockets of your backpack opened, maybe even twice a day. Expect female pickpockets. Don't let them surround you. Approaching you with \"Hello, I'm a student\" seems to be a quite popular pick-up line for them.\n\n\n== Stay healthy ==\nPublic hospitals are generally poorly equipped and overcrowded, and staff tend to speak little to no English. As such, foreigners are highly advised to rely on private hospitals instead.\n\n Hanoi French Hospital. Hanoi's first private hospital, with staff who are able to speak French and English. \n Vinmec Times City International Hospital. First location of the Vinmec chain of private hospitals throughout Vietnam. \n\n\n== Connect ==\n\n\n=== Telephone ===\nHanoi code: area code changed from \"4\" to \"24\", and a \"3\" has been added in front of all 7-digit local numbers. Examples:\nOld dialling style: 1234567 (from within the city) or 04 1234567 (inter-provincial) or +84 4 1234567 (from overseas)\nNew dialling style: 3 1234567 (from within the city) or 024 3 1234567 (inter-provincial) or +84 24 3 1234567 (from overseas)\n\n\n=== Internet ===\nMost regular restaurants and caf\u00e9s have free Wi-Fi. It is culturally accepted to go to a coffee shop, order a drink and study/work there for a few hours.\nThere are also many places in the city where free public Wi-Fi is available.\n\n\n== Cope ==\n\n\n=== Gyms ===\n No Name, 88 Hang Buom St. If you want to do some mild weight training on a budget. The gym is in very poor condition: the floor is hazardous and no one will spot you while benching so ensure your last rep you are able to place the bar back or go with a friend. The front of the gym is full of scooters and the rear wall has pictures of Uncle Ho exercising. \n2 X-Men Gym, 91 P. Ph\u00f9ng H\u01b0ng (In the Old Quarter. On the fourth floor). 06:00-21:00.

For visa extensions. \n\n\n== Go next ==\nIf you are the adventurous type or simply bored temporarily of the city atmosphere, then consider a circuit through the northern countryside. A round trip will take you to a lot of charming villages and through hills and valleys with charming views. Main roads are generally in good condition and you can easily do a couple of hundred kilometers a day. The villages and provinces are generally safe at night, and you get to see a lot of Vietnamese culture such as various tribespeople. While bus services are available (albeit not always reliable), a recommended alternative is to rent a bike or car and make the trip on your own. Motorbikes in decent quality can be rented and many places have suggestions for routes.\n\nHa Long Bay's spectacular ocean karst topography is the most popular side-trip from Hanoi.\nThe Sapa mountain region close to the Chinese border, home to ethnic minorities, gorgeous mountain scenery, and trekking paths connecting many tiny mountain villages, is the second-most popular trip. 320 km northwest from the capital, Sapa is accessible by direct private bus services from Hanoi, which now only takes 5h30 thanks to excellent new highways; or by 8-hour train journey from Hanoi Station to Lao Cai, then onward by minibus or hired motorbike.\n\n Perfume Pagoda (can be reached by public transport (bus); tours are available anywhere in Hanoi). An ancient Buddhist pilgrimage site about 60 km southwest of Hanoi. A full-day excursion that involves a boat trip to the main site, where you will hike (30-45 min) or take a cable car up a mountain. Near the top is a large limestone cave containing Buddhist shrines and statues. There are various other temples and grottoes along the way. \nBat Trang, a village famous for its pottery, 9 km southeast of Hanoi. It is accessible by taking Bus 47, which originates at Long Bien. Just hop on (the bus will be clearly labelled with the number 47 and the text \"Long Bien - Bat Trang\". Take it to the last stop, which is directly opposite the pottery market (haggle for lower prices, and insist on paying in dong). Head back up the street to the factories to the products being made.\nCao Bang, featuring the beautiful Ban Gioc Waterfall, is five hours away by bus, near the Chinese border.\nCuc Phuong National Park, is the largest national park in Vietnam and an easy day-trip from Hanoi.\nCo Loa is the oldest ancient capital in the region; a little-visited site slightly northeast of Hanoi.\nTam Coc/Hoa Lu in Ninh Binh Province, is a day trip is combining heritage tourism and natural landscape tourism. Hoa Lu is the site of the first capital of Vietnam in the 10th century, and was home to two kings, Dinh Bo Linh (Dinh Tien Hoang) and Le Hoan. There are now two shrines dedicated to these two kings. About 30 min away from Hoa Lu is Tam Coc [three grottoes], also known as Halong Bay on land. It features karst landforms surrounded by paddy fields, and is accessed by little wooden boats. Boats take about one hour. This is an excellent alternative to Halong Bay for those who have short attention spans, as the boat trip takes a mere hour versus Halong Bay tourist boats which take 5 hours. One minor annoyance involves peddlers on boats hawking their wares, and your boat rower trying to sell you embroidery.\nDong Hoi, the first major beach city before Hue going south, sleepy but with all the necessary infrastructure; laid back, authentic and genuinely friendly, with at least half a dozen hostels, and convenient for accessing Phong Nha Ke Bang national park.\nLaos, long haul buses to Laos leave from Hanoi daily and can be booked at any travel agent or even online. Buses to Vientiane, 24 hours; Luang Prabang, 27-30 hours; Vang Vieng, 27-30 hours. You will be on the same bus as Luang Prabang, but changes buses at a small town in Lao. Going directly to Vang Vieng is a good choice for travellers looking to skip Vientiane, and just go to Luang Prabang and then onto Thailand. Buses to Southern Laos are available as well."

        "title": "Bangkok",
        "extract": "Bangkok (Thai: \u0e01\u0e23\u0e38\u0e07\u0e40\u0e17\u0e1e\u0e2f Krung Thep) is the capital and largest city of Thailand. With a population of over eleven million inhabitants, Bangkok is by far Thailand's main city, with the urban sprawl comprising nearly half of Thailand's population, and the largest city on the Southeast Asian mainland. Its high-rise buildings, heavy traffic congestion, intense heat and naughty nightlife do not immediately give you a warm welcome \u2014 but don't let your first impression mislead you. It is one of Asia's most cosmopolitan cities with magnificent temples and palaces, authentic canals, busy markets, opulent shopping malls and a vibrant nightlife that has something for everyone.\nFor years, it was only a small trading post at the banks of the Chao Phraya River, until King Rama I, the first monarch of the present Chakri dynasty, turned it into the capital of Siam in 1782, after the burning of Ayutthaya by Burmese invaders. Since then, Bangkok has turned into a national treasure house and functions as Thailand's spiritual, cultural, political, commercial, educational and diplomatic centre.\n\n\n== Districts ==\nBangkok is a huge and modern city humming with family activities, nightlife and fervor. Administratively, it is split up into 50 districts (\u0e40\u0e02\u0e15 khet), which are further split into 180 sub-districts (\u0e41\u0e02\u0e27\u0e07 khwaeng), but these are more often used in official business and for addresses. Visitors will find the conceptual division below of the main areas more useful for getting around.\n\n \n \n\nAround Bangkok are the provinces of Nakhon Pathom to the west, Nonthaburi to the northwest, Pathum Thani to the north, Chachoengsao to the east, Samut Prakan to the southeast and Samut Sakhon to the southwest.\n\n\n== Understand ==\nJust under 14 degrees north of the equator, Bangkok is a tropical metropolis that is also one of the most traveller-friendly cities in Asia. A furious assault on the senses, visitors from northern climates are immediately confronted by the heat, the pollution, unpleasant smells, and the irrepressible smile worn by many Thais. The city is surprisingly safe (except for petty crimes) and more organised than it initially appears, and is full of hidden gems waiting to be discovered. The high relative humidity and warm temperature favour the growth of tropical plants \u2014 you'll find exotic orchids and delicious fruit everywhere. Bougainvillea and frangipani bloom practically all over the city. Thai cuisine is justifiably famous, varied, and affordable. Bangkok for many represents the quintessential Asian capital. Saffron-robed monks, garish neon signs, graceful Thai architecture, spicy dishes, colourful markets, traffic jams, and the tropical climate come together in a happy coincidence. It is difficult to leave with only lukewarm impressions of the city.\n\n\n=== History ===\n\n\"Bangkok\" was originally a small village on the west bank of the Chao Phraya River. After the fall of Ayutthaya in the late 18th century, King Taksin the Great turned that village into Siam's new capital and renamed it Thonburi. In 1782, King Rama I moved the capital to the eastern bank of the river at Rattanakosin; originally the site of a Chinese community, which was moved outside the new city walls to Yaowarat. King Rama I named the city Krung Thep, as it is now known to Thais, and which in English translates as the \"City of Angels\".\nThe full name \"Krungthepmahanakhon Amonrattanakosin Mahintharayutthaya Mahadilokphop Noppharatratchathaniburirom Udomratchaniwetmahasathan Amonphimanawatansathit Sakkathattiyawitsanukamprasit\" (\u0e01\u0e23\u0e38\u0e07\u0e40\u0e17\u0e1e\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e19\u0e04\u0e23 \u0e2d\u0e21\u0e23\u0e23\u0e31\u0e15\u0e19\u0e42\u0e01\u0e2a\u0e34\u0e19\u0e17\u0e23\u0e4c \u0e21\u0e2b\u0e34\u0e19\u0e17\u0e23\u0e32\u0e22\u0e38\u0e18\u0e22\u0e32\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e14\u0e34\u0e25\u0e01\u0e20\u0e1e \u0e19\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e31\u0e15\u0e19\u0e4c\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e18\u0e32\u0e19\u0e35 \u0e1a\u0e38\u0e23\u0e35\u0e23\u0e21\u0e22\u0e4c\u0e2d\u0e38\u0e14\u0e21\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e19\u0e34\u0e40\u0e27\u0e28\u0e19\u0e4c\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e2a\u0e16\u0e32\u0e19 \u0e2d\u0e21\u0e23\u0e1e\u0e34\u0e21\u0e32\u0e19\u0e2d\u0e27\u0e15\u0e32\u0e23\u0e2a\u0e16\u0e34\u0e15 \u0e2a\u0e31\u0e01\u0e01\u0e30\u0e17\u0e31\u0e15\u0e15\u0e34\u0e22\u0e30\u0e27\u0e34\u0e29\u0e13\u0e38\u0e01\u0e23\u0e23\u0e21\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e2a\u0e34\u0e17\u0e18\u0e34\u0e4c) is listed as the world's longest location name by the Guinness Book of Records; an English rendering goes like this: \"The city of angels, the great city, the residence of the Emerald Buddha, the impregnable city of Ayutthaya of God Indra, the grand capital of the world endowed with nine precious gems, the happy city, abounding in an enormous Royal Palace that resembles the heavenly abode where reigns the reincarnated god, a city given by Indra and built by Vishnukarn\". Foreigners never caught on to the change, so in foreign languages Krung Thep inherited the name Bangkok, which became its formal English name. For Thais, the name Bangkok refers to the former village on the west bank of the Chao Phraya, which was incorporated into Greater Bangkok in 1971.\nLife was taking place on the water; ordinary people lived on bamboo-rafts along the river, while floating vendors roamed the water to sell fruit and vegetables. The only stone structures built on land were temples and palaces. In the 19th-century, Western powers incorporated much of Southeast Asia into their colonial empires. Kings Rama IV and V felt that the only way to keep Siam independent was to modernise the country along European lines. Traditional canals were filled up and turned into roads. King Rama V moved the residence of the King to Dusit and laid out that district's grand boulevards along European lines.\nBangkok really started to develop after World War II. The economic centre shifted from the orderly planned city of Rattanakosin in an eastward direction, leaving Bangkok without an obvious centre. Bangkok established itself as the driving power behind Thailand's new role as a newly industrializing country from the 1980s onwards. Rapid economic growth has attracted migration from the countryside, with millions of Thais moving here from Isaan and other regions to make a living. As Thailand has grown into the main economic centre of the region, in modern times, Bangkok has also attracted many migrant workers from neighbouring Myanmar, Laos, and Cambodia.\nThis rapid expansion turned Bangkok into one of the most cosmopolitan and happening cities in Asia; but also ensured numerous problems. A wide gap has emerged between those who profit from economic activity, and those who came to the city from the countryside in search of work. Bangkok's seemingly never-ending traffic jams continue as the new Skytrain and MRT systems are too expensive for the working class. Getting a break from the fumes in a park would seem to be a good idea, but unfortunately, Bangkok has the lowest amount of green space of all capital cities in the world.\n\n\n=== Addresses and navigation ===\nAddresses in Bangkok use the Thai addressing system, which may be a little confusing to the uninitiated. Large roads such as Silom or Sukhumvit are thanon (\u0e16\u0e19\u0e19), often abbreviated Th or glossed \"Road\", while the side streets branching off from them are called soi (\u0e0b\u0e2d\u0e22). Sois are numbered, with even numbers on one side and odd numbers on the other side. Thus, an address like \"25 Sukhumvit Soi 3\" means house/building number 25 on the 3rd soi of Sukhumvit Road. While the soi numbers on each side will always advance upward, the numbers often do not advance evenly between sides \u2014 for example, Soi 55 could be across from Soi 36. Many well-known sois have an additional name, which can be used instead of the number. Sukhumvit Soi 3 is also known as \"Soi Nana Nuea\", so the address above might thus also be expressed as \"25 Soi Nana Nuea\". The extension /x is used for new streets created between existing streets, as seen in Sukhumvit's soi pattern 7, 7/1, 7/2, 9, 11. Some short alleys are called trok (\u0e15\u0e23\u0e2d\u0e01) instead of soi.\n\nTo make things a little more complex, some large sois like Soi Ekkamai (Sukhumvit Soi 63) and Soi Ari (Phahonyothin Soi 7) have their own sois. In these cases, an address like \"Ari Soi 3\" means \"the 3rd soi off Soi Ari\", and you may even spot addresses like \"68/2 Ekkamai Soi 4, Sukhumvit Road\", meaning \"2nd house beside house 68, in the 4th soi of Ekkamai, which is the 63rd soi of Sukhumvit\". In many sois, the house numbers are not simply increasing, but may spread around.\nTo further bewilder the tourist who doesn't read Thai, the renderings of Thai street names in the Latin alphabet are not consistent. The road running towards Don Mueang Airport from Victory Monument may be spelled Phahonyothin or Phahon Yothin or Pahon Yothin or Phaholyothin depending on which street sign or map you consult. It's all the same in Thai, of course, only the romanisation varies.\nAnd if that's not confusing enough, most of the larger streets tend to change names altogether every few kilometres. Sukhumvit is called Sukhumvit on one side of the tollway (roughly east), but it becomes Phloen Chit just before you cross Witthayu Road (aka Wireless Road) going towards the river. Keep going just a few more streets and it becomes Rama I Road (or Phra Ram Neung Road) after you pass Ratchadamri Road. But if you were to turn right onto Ratchadamri, in just a few blocks you'll find yourself on Ratchaprarop Road (past Phetchaburi, aka New Phetburi, which is called Phitsanulok closer to the river).\nFortunately, there's logic to these name changes: most of them are neighbourhoods. It wouldn't make sense to call the road Sukhumvit if it's no longer running through the Sukhumvit area, would it? Thus, Sukhumvit becomes Phloen Chit where it runs through the Phloen Chit area. It's when you're able to grasp the city in terms of its neighbourhoods that it both becomes more navigable and more charming. Likewise, Pratunam and Chatuchak are much more than just markets; they're neighbourhoods, each with their own distinct character.\nCompass directions are not widely used by Thais to navigate in Bangkok. Thus, asking for directions in terms of \"Is that west from here?\" will probably earn you little more than a confused look from a local. You're better off to familiarise yourself with the neighbourhoods and navigate to and from them. \"How do I get to Thong Lo?\" will get you there faster than asking for directions to Sukhumvit Soi 55.\nOne exception: the Chao Phraya River is the landmark in Bangkok, and many directional references can be made as \"toward the river\" or \"away from the river\". If you aren't too close, that is: since the river winds around the most popular tourist areas, river references tend to be most helpful when you're wandering farther afield than Khao San Road, Sanam Luang or Rattanakosin. And wander you should.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nAccording to the World Meteorological Organization, Bangkok is the world's hottest city. Just 14 degrees north of the equator, Bangkok is sunny at all times of the year with temperatures over 32 \u00b0C (90 \u00b0F).\nThe most pleasant time to visit is the cool season that lasts from Nov-Feb. It is both the coolest and driest period \u2014 the Emerald Buddha statue in Wat Phra Kaeo even wears a scarf during this period! Don't think that's necessary though \u2014 daytime temperatures still hover around 32 \u00b0C (90 \u00b0F), but it does cool down to around 23 \u00b0C (73 \u00b0F), and on rare occasions can even dip as low as 15\u00b0C. March and April represent the hot season, and hot it is \u2014 35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F) on average. Average heat indices are around 42 \u00b0C (108 \u00b0F) during the day and 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) at night, but don't be surprised to see heat indices rising to 48 \u00b0C (118 \u00b0F) or higher, with nighttime heat indices around 36 \u00b0C (97 \u00b0F). This is the worst season to visit Bangkok, so plan in a lot of air-conditioned shopping mall visits and get a hotel with a swimming pool. Then there's the wet season that runs from May-Oct. Expect massive downpours resulting in floods all over the city, and spells of thunder at times. It's not all bad though \u2014 the afternoon showers are actually a pleasant way to cool down from the heat, and while they may last all day, usually they're over within an hour. Extreme rainfall happens in September and October, so these months are best avoided.\nWhatever season you're visiting, don't take the weather lightly \u2014 temple-tramping in the scorching afternoon sun can be a challenge, so come well-prepared. Dress lightly for the weather, but keep in mind that some palaces and temples (notably the Grand Palace) have a strict dress code, i.e., everyone must fully cover their torso, legs and upper arms. So shorts, halter tops, etc. will deny you entry. At entrances to some major attractions, vendors may rent needed coverage.\nAlso be sure you drink enough fluids! You have no excuse not to, as 7-Elevens and other convenience stores are abundant in Bangkok and sell cooled beverages for as little as 10 baht. Locals get their water from \"reverse osmosis\" purified water machines that fill up a one-litre bottle for 1 baht, but the potability for visitors may vary.\n\n\n=== Listen ===\nThe Bangkok Podcast. A long-running podcast produced by two ex-pats living in Bangkok. Featuring special guests and unique stories focussed on ex-pats' and travellers' experiences in Bangkok.\n\n\n=== Read ===\nComrade Aeon's Field Guide to Bangkok by Emma Larkin. A multi-faceted book narrated by diverse characters who are trying to find their own path through the difficulties and opportunities presented by this chaotic and vibrant city.\n\n\n=== Watch ===\nForeign films were popular in Thailand from the get-go, but in the 1920s a local film industry started to emerge in Bangkok. The most critically acclaimed Thai films were produced in the \"three waves\" of the Thai film industry, the 1930s, the 1950s and the late 1990s/early 2000s, although films made before World War II have unfortunately been lost. Predominant genres are action, historical epics, romance and gay/transgender films, almost always intertwined with elements of comedy. The following are staged (at least partly) in Bangkok:\n\n6ixtynin9 (\u0e40\u0e23\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e15\u0e25\u0e01 69, Pen-ek Ratanaruang, 1999). Tum, a secretary just fired from a financial corporation during the Asian financial crisis, discovers an instant noodle box in front of her door. It is filled with money and she decides to keep it. However, the people that left it there soon want it back.\nBangkok Dangerous (\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e07\u0e01\u0e2d\u0e01\u0e41\u0e14\u0e19\u0e40\u0e08\u0e2d\u0e23\u0e31\u0e2a \u0e40\u0e1e\u0e0a\u0e0c\u0e06\u0e32\u0e15\u0e40\u0e07\u0e35\u0e22\u0e1a \u0e2d\u0e31\u0e19\u0e15\u0e23\u0e32\u0e22, The Pang Brothers, 1999). The debut of the Pang Brothers, Bangkok Dangerous is a stylish film about a hitman who finds love, and realises how his actions are hurting good people.\nThe Beach (Danny Boyle, 2000). Richard (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) is a young American backpacker looking for adventure. In Khao San Road, he meets Daffy, who gives him a map to a secret island. It is a popular film in the backpacker community. Besides Bangkok, some scenes in this Hollywood production are filmed in Ko Phi Phi, a beach island in the south of Thailand.\nCitizen Dog (\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e32\u0e19\u0e04\u0e23, Wisit Sasanatieng, 2004). An eccentric, bright, colour-splashed film that follows the life of Pod as he moves to Bangkok from the countryside. Without a goal in life, Pod falls in love with Jin, a girl who lives for her dreams. It gives a playfully ironic portrait of Bangkok, the city that offers false dreams and real disillusionment.\nThe Hangover Part II (Todd Phillips, 2011). American comedy film about a group of friends (the \"wolf pack\") who travel to Bangkok for a bachelor party. A lot of stereotypes are confirmed, but it is still a good laugh. Most scenes of the film are shot in Yaowarat, Sukhumvit and Thonburi. The State Tower in Silom is also featured.\nIron Ladies (\u0e2a\u0e15\u0e23\u0e35\u0e40\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e47\u0e01, Youngyooth Thongkonthun, 2000). This film follows the true story of a men's volleyball team that almost entirely consists of gay and transgender players. The team competes for the 1996 national championships, and while the crowd loves them, they are being judged by other teams and match officials.\nOng-Bak: Muay Thai Warrior (\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e04\u0e4c\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e01, Prachya Pinkaew, 2003). Martial-arts star Tony Jaa's breakthrough film and an absolute must-see for those interested in Muay Thai or fight choreography. Many locations in Bangkok are featured, but don't think Khao San Road is the underground fighting den as it is portrayed.\n\n\n=== Tourist information ===\nBangkok tourist information\n\n\n== Talk ==\nThe main language in Bangkok is the central dialect of Thai, which differs somewhat from the northern dialect spoken around Chiang Mai. However, due to the presence of large numbers of tourists, many people working in the service industry have a basic grasp of English, as do staff at many of the popular food stalls.\nBangkok is also home to a large ethnic Chinese community, many of whom are bilingual in Teochew and Thai. Mandarin also increasingly widely spoken in tourism industry to cater to the large number of Chinese tourists.\nThe MRT and BTS station signage includes both Thai and English, and ticket counter staff usually know enough English to serve you. Most taxi drivers cannot speak English, so therefore have your hotel receptionist show your taxi driver the address in Thai. Other European languages are not widespread in Bangkok.\n\n\n== Get in ==\n\n\n=== By plane ===\nBangkok is served by two airports: Suvarnabhumi Airport (BKK IATA) (pronounced Soo-wahn-nah-poom) and Don Mueang Airport (DMK  IATA). Suvarnabhumi Airport is the main airport and used by all full-service airlines, but Nok Air, Air Asia, Scoot, and some other low cost carriers use Don Mueang Airport. Both airports lie about 30 km (19 mi) out on opposite sides of the city, so be prepared for a long ride to get into the city centre, and an even longer ride to transfer between them. A free transfer bus between the two airports is available if you can show an appropriate boarding pass. On a good day this takes about an hour, but the highway is often badly congested, so always allow 2\u20133 hr for this transfer. It is a good idea to have Thai baht ready for connecting to the city. Good money changing options are available at the BKK metro station.\n\n\n==== Suvarnabhumi Airport ====\nMain article: Suvarnabhumi Airport\n\n1 Suvarnabhumi Airport (\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e27\u0e23\u0e23\u0e13\u0e20\u0e39\u0e21\u0e34 BKK IATA) (30 km (19 mi) east of Bangkok). Space-age Suvarnabhumi Airport started operations in Sep 2006 and is now Bangkok's main airport and one of the busiest airports in Southeast Asia. It is used for international and domestic flights to Bangkok. There is only one terminal building, which covers both domestic and international flights. It is huge, and by some measures the world's largest, so allow time for getting around. There are two immigration sections, but processing time can be lengthy, at least 30 min and on bad days almost 2 hr.   \nOn the basement level of the passenger terminal, the Airport Rail Link offers a speedy train service to downtown. There are no express services, but the all-stops commuter line is still a great way of avoiding Bangkok's horrendous rush hour traffic, particularly when it's raining. Trains depart 06:00-midnight every day, with a train every 10-13 min, and after Makkasan station they continue to Ratchaprarop (transfer to MRT) and Phaya Thai (Skytrain) stations. The ride to Phaya Thai takes 26 min from the airport and costs 45 baht.\nYou can also take a free shuttle bus to the airport bus terminal aka Transportation Centre to catch inexpensive city buses. These may be convenient if you are going to a suburban area like Rangsit or Bang Kapi. Since June 2017 express bus S1 runs from the terminal building to Khao San Road.\nIf you need a taxi, ordinary metered taxis are available on the first floor (one floor below arrivals). Follow the \"public taxi\" signs that lead to the official taxi queue outside of the airport premises. Avoid the touts in the arrival hall; the taxis they are trying to get you into are mostly likely illegal, and the risk of getting ripped off is much higher with them. ATM-style ticket booths dispense numbered slips, with the number indicating the bay in which your taxi is parked. You can choose between a normal taxi good for 2 adults with baggage and a big taxi. Keep the slip since it helps to make a complaint if the driver scams you. There is a surcharge on top of the meter (not per passenger), meaning that trips to the city will cost 250-400 baht plus possible expressway tolls of 50 and 25 baht (March 2020) depending on route. Make sure you have change ready to pass to the toll operators to avoid being overcharged for the tolls later on. The ride takes about 45\u201360 min depending on traffic and destination.\n\n\n==== Don Mueang Airport ====\n\n2 Don Mueang Airport (\u0e14\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e40\u0e21\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e07 DMK  IATA) (about 30 km (19 mi) north of Sukhumvit). This was Bangkok's main airport until 2006. These days, the airport primarily caters to budget carriers, and handles flights by Thai Lion Air, Scoot, Nok Air, Orient Thai and Air Asia. It is a bit harder to reach DMK than BKK due to the absence of a practical rail connection.   \n\nTaxi : the public taxi stand is on the end of the arrival area. Follow the signs to the taxi stand. (Don't be fooled by all the taxi service booths in the main hall.) The same booth and slip system as at Suvarnabhumi Airport is used here. If the queue at the taxi stand is long or you need a more spacious car, you may want to book a (so-called) limousine taxi from the desks in the terminal. This will get you a slightly nicer car at about twice the price. There is also an unofficial taxi queue (but for proper metered taxis) on the main road right outside the terminal, to get there, use the bridge towards the railway station, but get off down the narrow staircase before crossing the main road (using this queue can cut the wait considerably and avoid the airport surcharge). Ignore any touts outside and do not get into any car with white licence plates, as these are not licenced to carry passengers.\nSpecial Bus + Skytrain (BTS) : The A1 airport bus runs to the Sena Nikhom BTS station. You can board it at exit 6 of Terminal 1 and exit 12 of Terminal 2. It runs from the airport 07:30-24:00 and to the airport 07:00-24:00. 30 baht collected by a steward on board once the bus leaves. Takes about 20 min and uses the Don Muang elevated tollway to avoid traffic jams. The bus can be very crowded, so make sure you stand early on the line. Most have Wi-Fi if you have a local sim to SMS register. After Sena Nikhom the bus continues to Ratchayothin BTS station and Vibhavadi hospital before returning to the airport. If you are going to the Victory Monument area, taking the A2 bus saves the trouble of switching onto the train (fare also 30 baht).\nExpress Bus: Since May 2017 A3 bus runs on the route Don Mueang - Dindaeng - Pratunam- Ratchaprasong - Ratchadamri - Lumphini Park, and A4 bus runs on the route Don Mueang - Yommarach - Lam Luang - Phan Fa - Democracy Monument - Khao San - Sanam Luang. Fares are 50 baht and buses pick up passengers at door #6 of Terminal 1 and door #12 of Terminal 2 between 07:00 and 23:00.\nTrain: across a covered overpass from the airport is Don Mueang Train Station. While the rickety old local services have been replaced by a modern commuter service running every 12-20 minutes, these terminate at Bang Sue in northern Bangkok, where you'll need to change to the MRT Blue Line to get anywhere useful.\nLimoBus : This private bus service has one route serving Khao San Road and another route serving Silom and Pratunam. It is cheaper than metered taxi for a solo traveller but significantly more expensive than city buses.\nCity Bus : There are also a number of public transport buses going by the airport, just follow the signs out toward the train station. Buses towards central Bangkok are at the airport's side of the road, so don't cross the highway. These are useful bus lines :\nAir-conditioned bus 504 will take you to CentralWorld at Ratchaprasong intersection (close to Siam Square), as well as to Lumphini Park and Silom, from where you can have access to the Skytrain.\nOrdinary and air-conditioned bus 29 will take you to Hualamphong Train Station passing by many places, including Victory Monument and Siam Square. You can also get off at the Chatuchak Weekend Market, where you can switch onto the metro or Skytrain. Sometimes the final stop is Victory Monument (19 baht).\nAir-conditioned bus 59 will take you to Sanam Luang in Rattanakosin. This route is time-consuming as Rattanakosin is far off from the airport.\nKeep in mind that some of these city buses don't complete the route. They are called \"additional bus\" (Thai: \u0e23\u0e16\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e23\u0e34\u0e21 rot serm). These kind of buses have a red sign in front of them with the final destination written on it (in Thai script of course). Check this before taking the bus. You can ask the locals at the bus stop or a conductor on the bus\n\n\n=== By bus ===\nWhen buying tickets for buses out of Bangkok, it's best to skip travel agents and their private buses, and get the tickets for public buses directly at Bangkok's three public bus terminals. These buses are cheaper, safer, faster, more comfortable and won't scam you onto a clapped-out minibus halfway along the way or to a bedbug-infested hotel at the end. Each of these long haul bus terminals serve a different direction. They are purposefully located in off-central locations, so the long-haul buses avoid the heavy traffic congestion in the centre of the city. They are:\n\n3 Eastern Bus Terminal (Ekkamai (\u0e40\u0e2d\u0e01\u0e21\u0e31\u0e22)), \u260f +66 2 391-2504. A relatively compact terminal right next to Ekkamai BTS station in Sukhumvit. Ekkamai serves destinations in Eastern Thailand, including Pattaya, Rayong, Ban Phe (for Ko Samet), Chanthaburi and Trat. If you're heading for Ko Chang, there is a specifically designated stop for it between Chanthaburi and Trat. You can also get a bus to the Cambodian border crossing at Poipet, look for the bus to Aranyaprathet and tell them you are going to Poipet when you buy the ticket. \n4 Northern and Northeastern Bus Terminal (Mo Chit 2 (\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e2d\u0e0a\u0e34\u0e15 2), \u260f +66 2 9362841 (-3). The largest, busiest, and most modern terminal, replacing the old Mo Chit terminal. The upper floor serves the Isaan region in the northeast of Thailand. The ground floor serves Northern Thailand, and shares some destinations with Ekkamai (including Pattaya, Rayong, Chanthaburi and Trat). The bus terminal is a fair hike from BTS station Mo Chit or MRT station Chatuchak Park. Motorbike taxis do the trip for a fixed fare (bargaining is pointless), while tuk-tuks charge whatever they feel like \u2014 when bargaining, remember that a real taxi with air conditioning will cost you about the same as a motortaxi (assuming little traffic). You can also take Bus 77 and pay the flat fare on board (this bus also goes from the terminal via Victory Monument, Pratunam, and Silom Rd). If you have a considerable amount of luggage, the easiest, if not necessarily fastest, option is to take a taxi directly to or from the bus terminal. \nBuying tickets at the terminal is reasonably easy: find a window with your destination written on it (in friendly Roman letters), pay the fare in big numbers on the same window, and you'll get a ticket on the next available departure. Blue writing means 1st class, red means 2nd class (avoid on longer trips), and tickets for destinations in Isaan are sold from the third floor. Ask the information desk on the first floor if you need help, or any of the Transport Co. staff, easily identifiable thanks to their natty white shirts with gold buttons. Next just find the departure stall and you're on your way. If you have time to kill, there are two fairly decent air-conditioned food courts at both ends of the main terminal building, plus KFC, Dunkin' Donuts, and lots of 7-Eleven outlets.\nAir-conditioned buses are available directly from Bangkok Mo Chit to Siem Reap, Cambodia. Transport Co., the state-owned company running the buses, offers daily services to Siem Reap. Departures every day at 08:00 and 09:00 in both directions.\n5 Southern Bus Terminal (Sai Tai Mai (\u0e2a\u0e32\u0e22\u0e43\u0e15\u0e49\u0e43\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e48)), Phutthamonthon Sai 1 Rd, Thonburi, \u260f +66 2 894-6122. Serves all destinations west and south of Bangkok from its somewhat inconvenient location on the Thonburi side of the river. Long-distance buses leave from here to destinations throughout Western Thailand (including Nakhon Pathom and Kanchanaburi) and Southern Thailand (including Krabi, Phuket, Surat Thani, Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan, Hat Yai, and others). The new terminal is a fairly pleasant airport-like structure with air-conditioning, electronic departure monitors (in English), a few bank offices, and fast food restaurants. The ground floor houses mostly Thai restaurants outside. The first floor has ticket sales and most restaurants. The third floor is a small shopping mall and is a good place to sprawl on the floor if you have a long layover. Unlike the rip-off operators at Khao San Road, all buses from here are public, well-regulated, cheap, and reasonably safe. Just buy your tickets at the numbered desk with your destination posted on it (almost always in English). (updated Jan 2018)\nGetting to the terminal is a bit of headache, as public transport is limited. The easiest option is to take a metered taxi, but if you're going there in the evening, especially during workdays, be prepared to fight a serious traffic jam \u2014 getting there can take 30 min or a full hour from the city centre. Ignore touts at Khao San Road \u2014 unlike what they might say, there really is no \"faster\" way when all the roads are congested.\nFrom Victory Monument BTS station, the terminal can be reached with pale orange air-conditioned Bus 515. When approached by the conductor, just say \"Sai Tai\". After quite a ride, the large bus terminal will be on the left side about 9 km (5.5 mi) after crossing the river (you won't miss it and probably will be told as well). Getting there by bus actually does not take much more time than taxi (it's almost the same in the likely case of a traffic jam), but the ride is much cheaper, especially if alone. Bus 556 no longer goes from Suvarnabhumi Airport, but from Makkasan Airport Rail Link (ARL) station. There are also white minibuses from various points around Bangkok, e.g., from Ramkhamhaeng (near Rajamangala National Stadium). There are inexpensive shuttle buses and slightly more expensive (but quicker loading and a bit faster) minibuses to and from the Northeastern Bus Terminal as well.\n\n\n=== By minibus ===\nFor travelling to Bangkok suburbs or locations within 200 km of the city, the fastest and often the cheapest way is to use public minibus (minivan) services. They run from parking lots beside the 6 Victory Monument Square (Thai:\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e38\u0e2a\u0e32\u0e27\u0e23\u0e35\u0e22\u0e4c anusawarii) (Use footbridge leading north from BTS Victory Monument exit 2).   . Facing the monument itself are the city bus stops, behind it there is a small market, and behind the market you will find many white-coloured minibuses just parking at the roadside and waiting for passengers. They depart when full, usually each 10\u201330 min. Fare is usually similar to long-distance buses with the same destination (if there are any). Other way, it could be estimated as 1 baht/km.\nSince October 2016 the minibuses to other provinces have been relocated to the three public bus terminals which makes them far less convenient. The city is easing the transition by providing free shuttle buses from Victory Monument Square to the bus terminals. The shuttles to Southern Bus Terminal, and Northern and Northeastern Bus Terminal depart from the northwestern quadrant of the square. It is unclear how long these free shuttles will remain in place.\nDestinations are written on the front and the side of the minibuses in Thai, so you should ask drivers or ticket sellers about your destination. Minivans are usually the fastest way of transportation because they take elevated expressways right from Victory Monument, thus avoiding traffic jams. Another advantage is that they start from the city centre of Bangkok and usually arrive at the city centre of their destination. Normal long-distance buses sometimes stop further away from the city centre. Minibus drivers are infamous for unsafe driving and deadly accidents. A disadvantage of minibuses is that leg room is limited, and might be not comfortable for tall people. If you have bulky baggage you either keep it on your lap or buy a seat for it.\nSome useful destinations within the city: Min Buri (for Siam Park), Nava Nakorn (for Don Mueang Airport or to get out along hwy 1 for hitching to the north/northeast), Phra Ram 2 (to the highway, for hitching to southern Thailand), Suvarnabhumi Airport.\nSome destinations served from Eastern Bus Terminal: Pattaya, Ban Phe (for Ko Samet), Rayong, Chanthaburi.\nSome destinations served from Northern and Northeastern Bus Terminal: Ayutthaya, Lopburi.\nSome destinations served from Southern Bus Terminal: Samut Songkhram, Samut Sakhon, Kanchanaburi, Phetchaburi, Hua Hin.\n\n\n=== By train ===\nSee also: Thailand#Get around\nTrains are run by the State Railway of Thailand.\nRailways converge on Bangkok from all parts of the country: Chiang Mai to the north, Nong Khai on the Laos border, Ubon Ratchathani to the east, Ban Klong Luk on the Cambodia border, Sattahip on the coast to the south, Nam Tok to the west, and Padang Besar on the Malaysia border.\nTickets for travel on any trains departing Bangkok may be purchased from any of the larger train stations, as well as online from the official SRT ticketing website D-Ticket or various resellers such as 12go. Bangkok is the only place in Thailand where travellers can reserve tickets over the phone (the 24-hour SRT hotline is 1690 and they have English-speaking operators), because tickets must be paid for at one of many train stations in Bangkok by 22:00 the next day. The official website is not easy to use: tourists report problems with incomplete translations on the English version of the website, as well as with registering an account and setting up payment methods.\nAs of 2023, the name Bangkok in the SRT intercity timetable refers to the new Krung Thep Aphiwat terminal. There is one exception: the Eastern Line service to Ban Klong Luk on the Cambodian border, where Bangkok means the historic Hua Lamphong station.\nSome tourists prefer to buy from agents like 12go, that have easy-to-use websites and English-speaking customer service. All agents charge extra fees for their services.\nA high speed railway is under construction between Bangkok and Vientiane, Laos, with a plan to continue it southward into Malaysia and Singapore.\n\n7 Hua Lamphong Station . An old stately terminal, this is no longer the main railway station in Bangkok. It's central, near Yaowarat and has its own metro station. It's a charming old building of 1916, yet surprisingly efficient and convenient. On timetables, it's usually called \"Bangkok\" in English or \"Krung Thep\" in Thai. Tickets for commuter trains leaving the same or the next day can be bought at the counters under the big screens. The only intercity train that terminates here is the Eastern Line from Ban Klong Luk on the Cambodian border.\n8 Krung Thep Aphiwat Central Terminal . Unofficially Bang Sue Grand Station, this is now the terminus for most inter-city trains. The station is directly connected to the MRT Blue line station of the same name, and is connected by Bus 52 to Mo Chit, for the long-distance bus terminal. It is the largest railway station in Southeast Asia, with 26 platforms; some 600 metres long.\n\n9 Thonburi Train Station (\u0e18\u0e19\u0e1a\u0e38\u0e23\u0e35 formerly Bangkok Noi Station) (west of the river in Thonburi). The terminus for twice-daily trains to Kanchanaburi (via Nakhon Pathom). Just to keep things confusing, the previous Thonburi Train Station right next to the river (accessible by the Chao Phraya Express Boat pier Railway Station) is now mothballed and turned into a museum, but it's only 800 m away from the new station. The weekend-only second class air conditioned tourist trains to Kanchanaburi and Nam Tok depart from Hualamphong Train Station.   \n10 Wongwian Yai Train Station (\u0e27\u0e07\u0e40\u0e27\u0e35\u0e22\u0e19\u0e43\u0e2b\u0e0d\u0e48) (About 800 m from the Skytrain station of the same name. To get there, take a metered taxi or walk (using a map)). Serves the rustic Mae Klong commuter line to the fishing village of Maha Chai. Trains run roughly hourly and the trip takes about one hour. The ride is of little interest if you want to get there fast, but is an experience for rail fans and an attraction in itself, with a nice view on the countryside's orchards, vegetable plantations and coconut groves. Maha Chai is a nice seafood destination, and if you feel like it, you can cross the Tha Chin river by ferry and continue by rail to Samut Songkhram. Tickets for trains departing from other stations are not sold at Wongwian Yai Train Station.   \n\n\n=== By ship ===\nNot many people come to Bangkok by cruise ship. Medium to large ships must dock at 11 Laem Chabang Port.  about 90+ min (varies considerably in rush hours) southeast of Bangkok and about 30 min north of Pattaya. A taxi service desk is available on the wharf, but charges extortionate prices for a trip to Bangkok, to charter a taxi (4 passengers), or to charter a minibus (usually 11 passenger seats). Slightly lower prices can be found by walking out to the main road and taking a minibus, but even these rates are still almost double the typical rate in the opposite direction. Better deals may be possible for round trips (even if returning the following day).\nIf you can easily get to and from the following bus terminals...\n\nFrequent first and second class bus services directly connect Laem Chabang with Bangkok's Eastern Bus Terminal (Ekkamai); less frequent direct services run to the Northeastern Bus Terminal (Mo Chit). A first class air conditioned bus (blue and white) to either will take 90 min or less. A quick way to get into Sukhumvit is to get an Ekkamai-bound bus and then disembark early at On Nut, where you can hop onto the Skytrain. The bus will always stop here if a passenger requests it.\nSouthbound buses to Pattaya can be boarded at the traffic lights on Sukhumvit Road in Laem Chabang. These are extremely frequent (at least 10 per hour).\nSmaller ships may dock well upriver at 12 Khlong Toei (Bangkok Cruise Port).    close to the city's center. Reaching major hotels and the many major points of interest is cheaper and much quicker than from Laem Chabang. A modest terminal provides processing for passengers. You'll also find \"managers\" inside who arrange tours and taxis. Costs can vary widely according to your negotiating skills or if you have the option of using a ship's shuttle other locations. The facility is within an active freight port. (Its entrance is not close to the metro stop of the same name.) The distance to the very-active port entrance from the terminal (about a kilometer) and heavy traffic in-between mean pedestrians are not allowed. Thus, options to get to/from the terminal are metered taxi and ship's bus/shuttle if offered.\n\n\n=== By car ===\n\nGetting into Bangkok by car is not a good idea, as you can easily waste half a day waiting in traffic just to get to the other side of the city. Three major highways lead to Bangkok from every direction in Thailand. The best way to get to Bangkok from Northern Thailand is via Phahonyothin Road (Rte 1), which comes from Mae Sai near the Myanmar border. Sukhumvit Road (Rte 3) comes from cities in Eastern Thailand, such as Trat, Pattaya, and Chonburi. Phetkasem Road (Rte 4), one of the longest roads in the world, extends all the way to the Malaysian border, serving Southern Thailand.\nTo ease congestion on these highways, a new system of motorways has emerged which will be extended in the future. The New Bangkok-Chonburi Motorway (Motorway 7) connects Chonburi and Pattaya. The Kanchanaphisek National Highway (Motorway 9 or \"Outer Ring Road\") makes a giant loop around Bangkok serving most satellite towns around it such as Nonthaburi and Samut Prakan.\n\n\n== Get around ==\nBangkok has a decent public transportation network by Southeast Asian standards, but much room for improvement lies in its integration. Bangkok is notorious for its traffic jams, so visitors are advised to rely on the rail and river networks whenever possible. Transit Bangkok is a journey planner that can help you choose the best route.\n\n\n=== By train ===\nThree separate operators form the Bangkok rail network: the Skytrain (BTS), the Metro (MRT), and the State Railway of Thailand (SRT). Trains are generally clean, modern and reliable, with signs and announcements in Thai and English. Each operator has a different fare system, meaning you will have to buy a separate ticket or stored value card for each network you wish to use. Fare payments can be made by tapping a contactless Visa or Mastercard on the fare gates of some lines but not others. Whilst transferring between operators is relatively straightforward, different names are used for some interchange stations. For instance, the interchange station known as Asok in the BTS system is known as Sukhumvit in the MRT system.\n\n\n==== Skytrain ====\n\nThe 13 Skytrain (BTS) operates three lines. The light green Sukhumvit Line travels from Khu Khot (N24) in the north to Kheha (E23) in the south. The dark green Silom Line travels from Bang Wa (S12) in the west to National Stadium (W1) in the city centre. The Gold Line travels from Krung Thon Buri (G1) to Khlong San (G3).   (updated Apr 2024)\nTickets are zone-based. You can buy and reload a \"Rabbit\" card at all stations. A new card costs 200 baht, including 100 baht stored value and a 100 baht non-refundable issuing fee. Your passport is required to buy the card. You can make payments at some convenience stores, restaurants and supermarkets with the card. Alternatively, you can buy a One-Day Pass for 150 baht per day. Single journey cards can be purchased at ticket counters and vending machines. All vending machines accept coins (Thai baht only). Some vending machines accept 20, 50 and 100 baht notes but there is often a queue to use them. Tickets can also be purchased at vending machines using Line Pay (link your credit card to Line Pay and scan the QR code). Single journey cards are tapped on the scanner to enter and deposited in the slot to exit. Fare payments cannot yet be made by tapping a contactless Visa or Mastercard on the fare gates.\nThe Skytrain serves various tourist attractions. The Sukhumvit Line and the Silom Line converge at Siam (CEN), the epicentre of modern Bangkok. The Sukhumvit Line passes Victory Monument and Chatuchak Weekend Market. The Silom Line passes Patpong Night Market and the Chao Phraya river. Khao San Road can be reached by taking the Silom Line to Saphan Taksin (S6) and transferring to a Chao Phraya Express Boat traveling from Sathorn Pier to Phra Arthit Pier. There are interchanges with the Metro at Bang Wa (S12), Sala Daeng (S2), Asok (E4) and Mo Chit (N7).\nThe Skytrain operates between 06:00am and midnight.\n\n\n==== Metro ====\nThe Metro (MRT) operates four lines. The  Blue  line travels in a circle from Lak Song to Tha Phra through Thonburi, Yaowarat, Silom, Sukhumvit, Ratchadaphisek and Chatuchak Weekend Market in Phahonyothin. The  Purple  line travels from Tao Poon to Nonthaburi across the Chao Phraya River. The  Yellow  line travels from Lat Phrao to Samrong. The  Pink  line travels from Nonthaburi to Min Buri.\nTickets are distance-based. Fare payments can be made by tapping a contactless Visa or Mastercard on the fare gates (Apple Pay and Google Pay are not yet accepted). Alternatively, you can buy and reload an \"MRT Plus\" card at all stations. A new card costs 180 baht, including 100 baht stored value, 50 baht refundable deposit, and a 30 baht non-refundable issuing fee. Single journey tokens can be purchased at ticket counters and vending machines. All vending machines accept coins and banknotes (Thai baht only). Single journey tokens are tapped on the scanner to enter and deposited in the slot to exit.\nThe Metro serves various tourist attractions. Sanam Chai is near Wat Pho and the Grand Palace. Wat Mangkon provides good access to Yaowarat. Si Lom and Lumphini are at either end of Lumphini Park. Phetchaburi provides an interchange with Saen Saep Express Boat at Asok Pier. Phra Ram 9 is near Fortunetown IT Mall which locals consider better than Pantip Plaza. Thailand Cultural Centre is near Rot Fai Ratchada night market. Lat Phrao is near Suan Lum night bazaar. If you're going to the Chatuchak Weekend Market, don't get out at Chatuchak Park, but go one stop further to Kamphaeng Phet as it drops you right inside the market. There are interchanges with the Skytrain at Bang Wa, Si Lom, Sukhumvit and Chatuchak Park.\nThe Metro operates between 06:00am and midnight.\n\n\n==== State Railway of Thailand ====\nThe State Railway of Thailand (SRT) operates the ARL Airport Rail Link, the SRT Dark Red line, the SRT Light Red line and the Greater Bangkok Commuter Rail.\nThe Airport Rail Link   ARL  connects Suvarnabhumi Airport to Makkasan for the Metro and Phaya Thai for the Skytrain. The express train and the City Air Terminal at Makkasan no longer operate but the commuter train is still useful for visitors. The ride from Suvarnabhumi to Makkasan costs just 35 baht and takes 22 minutes (cheaper and faster than a taxi). The ride from Suvarnabhumi to Phaya Thai costs just 45 baht and takes 27 minutes (also cheaper and faster than a taxi).\nTickets are distance-based. Single journey tokens can be purchased at ticket counters and vending machines. All vending machines accept coins and banknotes (Thai baht only). Single journey tokens are tapped on the scanner to enter and deposited in the slot to exit. Fare payments cannot yet be made by tapping a contactless Visa or Mastercard on the fare gates.\nThe Airport Rail Link can get very crowded at rush hour, but you are likely to find a seat if boarding from either end at Phaya Thai or Suvarnabhumi. There are escalators and lifts if you have baggage, but no luggage racks on the trains. At Makkasan station you can roll your bags along a footbridge to Phetchaburi Metro station. At Phaya Thai station most passengers walk forward to the staircases. You need to turn backward in the direction in which the train arrived for lifts and escalators. You can then roll your bags along a footbridge to Phaya Thai Skytrain station.\nThe Airport Rail Link operates between 06:00am and midnight.\nThe SRT Dark Red Line connects Bang Sue and Rangsit, stopping at Don Mueang for connections to Don Mueang International Airport.\nTickets are distance-based. Fare payments can be made by tapping a contactless Visa or Mastercard on the fare gates (Apple Pay and Google Pay are not yet accepted). Alternatively, you can buy and reload a \"Stored Value Ticket\" card at all stations. A new card costs 300 baht, including 200 baht stored value, 50 baht refundable deposit, and a 50 baht non-refundable issuing fee. Single journey tokens can be purchased at ticket counters and vending machines. All vending machines accept coins and banknotes (Thai baht only). Single journey tokens are tapped on the scanner to enter and deposited in the slot to exit.\nThe SRT Dark Red Line operates between 05:00am and midnight. \nThe SRT Light Red Line connects Bang Sue and Taling Chan, for connections to Taling Chan Floating Market.\nTickets are distance-based. Fare payments can be made by tapping a contactless Visa or Mastercard on the fare gates (Apple Pay and Google Pay are not yet accepted). Alternatively, you can buy and reload a \"Stored Value Ticket\" card at all stations. A new card costs 300 baht, including 200 baht stored value, 50 baht refundable deposit, and a 50 baht non-refundable issuing fee. Single journey tokens can be purchased at ticket counters and vending machines. All vending machines accept coins and banknotes (Thai baht only). Single journey tokens are tapped on the scanner to enter and deposited in the slot to exit.\nThe SRT Light Red Line operates between 05:00am and midnight.\nThe Greater Bangkok Commuter Rail consists of several suburban lines running to and from the outskirts of the city during rush hour and is of little use to tourists.\n\n\n=== By bus ===\n\nLocal buses, operated by the Bangkok Mass Transit Authority (\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e04\u0e4c\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e02\u0e19\u0e2a\u0e48\u0e07\u0e21\u0e27\u0e25\u0e0a\u0e19\u0e01\u0e23\u0e38\u0e07\u0e40\u0e17\u0e1e).    aka BMTA (\u0e02\u0e2a\u0e21\u0e01), are the cheapest but also the most challenging way of getting around. There is a bewildering plethora of routes, usually marked only in Thai. Even locals have a hard time with these, but at least they can call the 1348 Bus Route Hotline, which is in Thai only. Bus stops list only the bus numbers that stop there and nothing more. They are also subject to Bangkok's notorious traffic, often terribly crowded, and many are not air-conditioned. If you want to get somewhere quickly and are not prepared to get lost, the buses should be avoided: remember that taxis are cheaper than most local buses in the West. However, they make for a good adventure if you're not in a rush and you don't mind being the centre of attention.\nThere is the Viabus app (for Android and IOS) which really helps finding your way around the bus system. In the app you can search for bus stops and bus routes, navigate and even GPS track busses. Also the app is available in English and you can select stops on a map.\nOtherwise, for those staying in Khao San Road where buses are the only practical means of public transport, the only free resource for decrypting bus routes is the official BMTA website. It has up-to-date if slightly incomplete listings of bus routes in English, but no maps. You can also ask your guest house about which buses to take if you're going to a particular destination. As a printed reference, the money spent on the Bangkok Bus Map by Roadway is a good investment if you're going to travel by bus more than once.\nThe hierarchy of Bangkok's buses from cheapest to best can be ranked as follows:\n\nRed bus, 8 baht flat fare. Spacious and fan-cooled (in theory). Unlike other buses, some of these run through the night (1.50 baht surcharge). These buses are BMTA-run.\nWhite/blue/orange bus, 10 baht flat fare. Exactly the same as the red buses, but cost two baht more. These buses are owned by private entities operated in conjunction with BMTA.\nBlue/yellow and cream/blue air-con, 12 baht for the first 8 km (5 mi), up to 20 baht max. These buses are quite comfy. The blue/yellow striped buses are privately owned while the blue/cream buses are BMTA-owned.\nWhite/Orange air-con (Euro II). 13 baht for the first few km, up to 25 baht max. These are all BMTA-run, newer, and more comfortable.\nBlue air-con (NGV), 15 baht for the first few km, up to 25 baht max. These are run by both private companies and the BMTA, and are the newest and most comfortable buses.\nBMTA-owned buses accept contactless payment, using the same fare scheme as normal tickets. The conductor will bring you a machine for you to scan your card. BMTA also offers pre-paid cards, monthly and weekly tickets using the same system. Weekly tickets cost 135 baht for red buses only and 270 baht for all buses. Monthly tickets cost 270 baht for red buses only and 540 baht for all buses.\nBuses stop only when needed, so wave them down (arm out, palm down) when you see one barreling your way. Although drivers are only meant to stop at bus stops, some may pick up and drop off passengers elsewhere. Once on board, pay the roaming collector after you board and keep the ticket, as there can be occasional spot-checks. Press the signal buzzer, usually near the door, when you want to get off.\nTwo further pitfalls are that buses of the same number may run slightly different routes depending on the colour, and there are also express services (mostly indicated by yellow signs) that skip some stops and may take the expressway.\nAirport buses allow luggage but regular buses do not. Enforcement of this rule varies.\n\n\n=== By boat ===\n\n\n==== Chao Phraya Express Boat ====\n\nA ride on the Chao Phraya River should be high on any tourist's agenda. The cheapest and most popular option is the  Chao Phraya Express Boat , basically an aquatic bus cruising up and down the river. The basic service goes from Wat Rajsingkorn (S4) all the way north to Nonthaburi (N30), with stops at most of Rattanakosin's major attractions including the Grand Palace (at Tha Chang) and Wat Pho (at Tha Tien). The closest pier to Khao San Road is Phra Arthit. Enter the express boat at the numerous piers and pay the conductor for the trip. She will approach you bearing a long metal ticket dispenser. At some bigger piers you can buy the ticket before boarding. When the metal cylinder lady approaches you, just show her the ticket you bought on the pier.\nThe different boat lines are indicated by the colour of the triangular pennant at the end of the boat. These flags can be confusing; don't think the yellow king's flag corresponds to the yellow line flag! \n\nThe orange flag line (14 baht, every day 06:00-19:00) is your best bet, as it covers the major tourist areas and is fairly quick. However, it does not stop at every pier unlike the:\nBasic \"no flag\" line (8, 10 or 12 baht) which is fairly slow and runs only during rush hours (M\u2013F 06:45\u201307:30 and M\u2013F 16:00\u201316:30).\nIt is better to avoid the faster yellow flag line (M\u2013F 06:15\u201308:10 and M\u2013F 15:30\u201318:05) since it skips many popular attractions including Khao San Road, the Grand Palace and Wat Pho.\nThe green flag line (10, 12, 19 or 31 baht, M\u2013F 06:10\u201308:10 and M\u2013F 16:05\u201318:05) skips many piers but its Pakkred terminus is the closest pier to Ko Kret if you want to spend a weekday there.\nIn addition to the workaday express boats, there is a blue flagged Tourist Boat which stops at a small subset of piers, offers commentary in English and offers a day pass and single ride tickets. The boats are slightly more comfortable and may be worth considering if you want to cruise up and down the most important tourist sights. They only operate once per 30 min and stop running by 15:00. The price is 40 baht (single journey, 150 baht for one day pass). Be careful as staff may tell that the (cheaper) orange flag regular boat is not coming for quite a while (as they are aggressively touting for business), but sometimes this is not the truth. If you want the tourist experience with guide and (very) loud speaker commentary, often unintelligible, then this is the one for you. However, be aware that you are fully entitled to enter the public piers (the ones with the blue lettering on white background with pier numbers on them) and take whichever express boat you want since no ticket is needed before boarding.\nThe signposting of the piers is quite clear, with numbered piers and English route maps. Sathorn (Taksin) pier has been dubbed \"Central\" station, as it offers a quick interchange to Saphan Taksin BTS Station. The boats run every 5\u201320 min from sunrise to sunset (roughly from 06:00\u201319:00), so ignore any river taxi touts who try to convince you otherwise. Beware of pier closures: in particular, as of 2022 Tha Tien pier next to Wat Pho has been closed for several years now for major upgrading works, requiring visitors to alight at Wat Arun and take another ferry across.\nMany piers are also served by cross-river ferries. These are particularly useful for reaching Wat Arun or the many piers at the Thonburi side of the river. Cross-river ferries run around every 10 min and only cost 4.5 baht. Pay at the kiosk on the pier and then walk through the turnstile.\n\n\n==== Saen Saep Express Boat ====\n\nThe Saen Saep Express Boat. serves the long Saen Saep Canal, one of the remaining canals (khlong) that used to flow through Bangkok. Mostly used by locals to commute to work, the service is cheap and you get to see the \"backside\" of the neighbourhoods, so to speak. Also, It is immune to Bangkok's notorious traffic jams. The total distance is 18 km (11 mi), and the service operates from 05:30-20:30.   \nThey are comparatively safe \u2014 just watch your step when boarding and disembarking as they don't stop at the pier for long and do not let the dirty water get into your eyes. To prevent splashes, the boats are equipped with little curtains that you can raise by pulling on a string, but they have to be lowered at every stop so people can clamber on board. Pay the fare to the fearless helmet-wearing ticket collectors who clamber around on the outside of the boat, ducking at bridges, as it barrels down the canal. Press the green 'bell' button if you want to get off at the next pier, else the boat might just skip it. The piers now even have (tiny) signs in English, with the exception of The Mall Bangkapi pier, and it's not obvious that you're at the mall when you get off the boat!\nThe canal runs parallel to Phetchaburi Road, and provides the easiest access from the Golden Mount in Rattanakosin (and nearby Khao San Road) to Siam Square and Pratunam. This line is aptly called the Golden Mount Line and runs from Panfa Leelard pier to Pratunam pier. If you want to continue your journey beyond Pratunam, passengers have to change boats there. The NIDA Line starts at Pratunam and heads east to Sukhumvit and Ramkhamhaeng. Hold on to your ticket.\n\n\n==== River taxi ====\nFor trips outside set routes, you can hire a long-tail river taxi at any major pier. These are fairly expensive, but with some haggling they may be suitable for small groups. To circumvent the mafia-like touts who attempt to get a large cut for every ride, agree for the price of the shortest possible ride (30 min), then negotiate directly with the captain when on board.\n\n\n=== By taxi ===\n\n\n==== Rideshare taxi ====\nThe main ride sharing company operating in Bangkok is Grab, which can also be used to book taxis. With predictable fares and easy English address entry, Grab is a convenient way to avoid both language barriers and possible taxi scams, although during surge periods fares may be higher. That said, good luck getting a taxi to use the meter if caught in a rainstorm late at night. You also have the option pay your driver in cash. Just like the case with taxis, you have to pay the cost of any tolls when using a ride share service at the toll booth.\n\n\n==== Metered taxi ====\n\nMetered taxis are a quick and comfortable way to get around town, at least if the traffic is flowing your way, but be warned that Bangkok taxi drivers are notorious for finding ways to run up the fare; insist that the meter is used, and if the driver claims that your destination is closed, if they don't know your destination, or if you're being taken elsewhere, just get out of the taxi. All taxis are now metered and air-conditioned. There are no surcharges (except from the airport), even at night; don't believe drivers who try to tell you otherwise. A red sign on the front window, if lit, means that the taxi is available.\nWhen the meter is switched on you will see a red number indicating the hailing fee somewhere on the dashboard or between the driver and you. Be sure to check for this at the start of the ride, as many drivers will \"forget\" to start the meter in order to overcharge you at the end of your trip. Most will start the meter when asked politely to do so (meter na khrap if you're male and meter na kha if you're female); if the driver refuses to use the meter after a couple of attempts, simply exit the taxi.\nAvoid taxis parked outside hotels or major tourist attractions; they are mostly there in the hope of greatly overcharging tourists, or getting commissions from businesses where they take you. Near major tourist districts like Khao San or Patpong, especially late at night, you will need to walk a block away to catch an honest driver. Sometimes your best bet is to walk to the road and catch an unoccupied metered taxi in motion (easier than it sounds, as Bangkok traffic tends to crawl the majority of the time, and one car out of four is a taxi), or go to a taxi stand where you see many locals queueing. Be smart and give your money to honest drivers, not cheats and touts. The only reason why they get away with this so frequently is that foreign tourists let them.\n\nBe sure to either know the correct pronunciation of your destination, or have it written in Thai, as taxi drivers in Bangkok are notoriously bad at reading maps, and most drivers speak limited English. Most hotels and guest houses will happily write out addresses in Thai for you. It is often difficult to properly pronounce addresses in Thai and even if most drivers will recognise the names of tourist hot spots even if grossly mispronounced, you may be out of luck. If your mobile phone works in Thailand, it is sometimes useful to call your hotel and ask the staff to speak to your driver in Thai. In addition, try to get your hotel's business card to show the taxi driver in case you get lost.\nThe very common yellow-green taxis are ones to avoid. They are owner-operated and of highly variable quality, and occasionally have rigged meters. All other colours belong to large taxi companies, which usually enforce their standards better.\nOn some routes, the driver will ask if the tollway should be used \u2014 this will usually save a lot of time. You have to pay the cost at the toll booth (not in advance and not at the end of the journey). Watch how much the driver really pays, as many try to keep the change.\nWhen getting out, try to have small bills (100 baht or less) or expect problems with change. Tips are not necessary, but are certainly welcome if you're happy about the service; most local passengers will round up or leave any coin change as tip.\n\n\n==== Tuk-tuk taxi ====\n\nWhat would Bangkok be without the much-loathed, much-loved tuk-tuks? You'll know them when you hear them, and you'll hate them when you smell them \u2014 these three-wheeled contraptions blaze around Bangkok leaving a black cloud of smog in their wake. For anything more than a 5-10 min jaunt or just the experience, they really are not worth the price \u2014 and, if you let them get away with it, the price will usually be 4 or 5 times what it should be anyway (which, for Thais, is around 30% less than the equivalent metered taxi fare).\nOn the other hand, you can sometimes ride for free if you agree to visit touristy clothing or jewellery shops (which give the tuk-tuk driver fuel coupons and commissions for bringing customers). The shops' salespeople are pushy, and try to scam you with bad quality suits or \"gems\" that in fact are worthless pieces of cut glass. But usually you are free to leave after 5-10 min of browsing. Visitors should beware though, sometimes one stop can turn in to three, and tuk-tuk drivers may not be interested in taking you where you need to go once they have their fuel coupons. Also, with Bangkok's densely congested traffic it is sure to waste hours of your time, if not the whole day.\n\nIf you still want to try the tuk-tuk, always hail a moving tuk-tuk from the main road. At tourist spots, these tuk-tuk drivers lie in waiting to disrupt your travels plans. Always agree on a price before entering the tuk-tuk. Also be crystal clear about your intended destination. If they claim that your intended destination is closed for the day, and offer to take you to other nearby tourist spots, insist on your destination or get out. If you're an all-male party, tuk-tuk drivers sometimes will just ignore your destination completely and start driving you to some brothel (\"beautiful girls\"). Insist continually and forcefully on going only to your destination; or take a metered taxi instead.\n\n\n==== Motorbike taxi ====\nWhen traffic slows to a crawl and there are no mass-transit alternatives for your destination, by far the fastest mode of transport is a motorbike taxi ( \u0e27\u0e34\u0e19\u0e21\u0e2d\u0e40\u0e15\u0e2d\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e44\u0e0b\u0e04\u0e4c win motosai). They typically wear colourful fluorescent yellow-orange vests and wait for passengers at busy places. Prices should be agreed in advance.\n\nFor the adrenaline junkie, a wild motosai ride can provide a fantastic rush. Imagine weaving through rows of stopped vehicles at 50 km/h (30 mi/h) with mere centimetres to spare on each side, dodging pedestrians, other motorbikes, tuk-tuks, stray dogs and the occasional elephant while the driver blithely ignores all traffic laws and even some laws of physics. Now do the same while facing backwards on the bike and balancing a large television on your lap, and then you can qualify as a local \u2014 though you might die in the process. Imagine your loved ones arranging to ship your dead body home from Bangkok because you took a dangerous risk you were warned not to. Motorcycle accidents are brutally common, and transportation of this sort is inherently hazardous. Be aware of the risk before using motorcycle taxis.\nThe overwhelming majority of motorcycle taxis do not travel long distances, but simply shuttle up and down long sois (side-streets) not serviced by other transport for a fixed fare. These are marginally less dangerous, especially if travel with the flow on a one-way street.\nThe law requires that both driver and passenger must wear a helmet. It is the driver's responsibility to provide you with one, so if you are stopped by police, any fine is also the driver's responsibility. However the provision of helmets is far from universal. A helmet should be provided when hiring a motorbike or moped, and two if there are two of you. When riding, keep a firm grasp on the seat handle and watch out for your knees.\n\n\n=== By car ===\nBangkok is notorious for its massive traffic jams, and rightly so. In addition, traffic is chaotic and motorcyclists seemingly suicidal. Therefore, most tourists consider driving in Bangkok a nightmare, and it is recommended that you stick to public transport. However, the proliferation of massive shopping malls means that there are now places to park if you must drive into town, albeit at a high cost. Smartphones with GPS and navigation apps with voice directions make it easier to find your way.\n\n\n=== By foot ===\nMany of Bangkok's main attractions are within 5 km (3.1 mi) from Siam Square. Walking long distances in hot weather along busy streets can be exhausting, but is a good way to get to see the city up close. Just drink plenty of water and watch out for uneven surfaces and motorcyclists. Food leftovers and the occasional surprises left by stray animals are other reasons to look where you're going. Bangkok residents almost instinctively avoid stepping on manhole covers because people have fallen into sewers through rotten ones. Women carry their handbags on the side away from the road to discourage bag snatchers on motorbikes.\nBe careful when crossing the road, even if you have a green light. Turning left at a red light is legal by default and drivers turn without indicators and without yielding to pedestrians. Drivers will not stop or slow down at crosswalks without traffic lights. When waiting to cross at major intersections with rounded corners, stand well away from the road, as turning motorcyclists may lean over the curb in order to squeeze past other vehicles. Always use pedestrian overpasses when available; Bangkok stray dogs are smart enough to use them.\nExpect to be accosted by taxi and tuk-tuk drivers and hustlers demanding to know where you're going, insisting that there is nothing to see ahead, and attempting to usher you to various businesses. Most will quickly move on to their next mark if ignored or firmly dismissed.\n\nIf you are weighed down by a large backpack and would like to leave it in a locker, do check out the automated lockers provided near several major metro stations. The charges vary based on size of the locker. A medium-sized locker can take two backpacks and will cost about 30 Baht an hour.\n\n\n== See ==\nIndividual listings can be found in Bangkok's district articles\nMost of Bangkok's sights are concentrated on the island of Rattanakosin, often referred to as the \"Old City\". Out of Bangkok's hundreds of temples, the Grand Palace, Wat Pho and Wat Arun usually make up the top 3. The Grand Palace has an immense size, so expect to spend at least a full morning or afternoon there. Within the palace grounds is Wat Phra Kaew, the most sacred Buddhist temple of Thailand. Unlike other temples, it is not one building, nor are there living spaces for monks. Instead, it is a collection of highly decorated holy buildings and monuments. One of its buildings houses the Emerald Buddha, and while you might not expect it from its size, it is the most sacred Buddha image in Thailand.\nNearby is Wat Pho, home to the world's largest reclining Buddha image and a famed massage school. Take the ferry across the Chao Phraya River to Thonburi for the outstanding Wat Arun. The main structure is about 60 to 88 m high and it is surrounded by four smaller prangs. It is one of Thailand's most picturesque temples, and is engraved on the inner part of all ten baht coins. It is so recognisable that it even became the logo of the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT). If you climb it, and look closely, you will see that it is beautifully decorated with colourful broken Chinese porcelain pieces. Heading back to Rattanakosin, there are many other major temples you could visit, including the Golden Mount, Wat Suthat and Wat Ratchanaddaram.\nDon't throw away the entry ticket of the Grand Palace, as it gives free entry to the Bang Pa-In Palace in Bang Pa-In (and not anymore to the Dusit Palace which has been closed to the public since 2017). It is situated in a leafy, European-style area built by King Rama V to escape the heat of the Grand Palace. Its main structure is the Vimanmek Mansion, touted as the largest golden teakwood house in the world, but you could spend your whole day in the museums if you wish. There are many museums in Bangkok showing traditional Thai-style residences. Many visitors take a tour through Jim Thompson's House, the CIA-operative's mansion assembled by combining six traditional Thai-style houses near Siam Square. Ban Kamthieng in Sukhumvit, M.R. Kukrit's Heritage Home in Silom and the Suan Pakkad Palace in Phahonyothin are not quite as impressive, but still make for a nice experience. Rattanakosin's museums are mostly dedicated to history and culture, including the National Museum (about Thai history and archaeological remains), the Museum of Siam, Rattanakosin Museum (which offers two guided tours with interactive displays regarding the history of old and modern Thai life), and the King Prajadhipok Museum. Bangkok has a small, but vocal art community, and you might want to visit the National Gallery or The Queen's Gallery, or one of the numerous smaller galleries spread over the city. Siam Square features the Bangkok Art and Culture Centre which has temporary art exhibitions throughout the year.\nLumphini Park in Silom is the largest park in central Bangkok, and a good way to escape the fumes. Backpackers around Khao San Road can head for Santichaiprakarn Park, a small but fun park along the Chao Phraya River with a breezy atmosphere, usually with locals juggling or practicing tricks. It is built around the 18th-century Phra Sumen Fort with a nice view on the modern Rama VIII cable-stayed bridge. Zoos and animal farms are some of the more popular tourist attractions in Bangkok, but before visiting, please be aware that animal welfare in Thailand is not strictly regulated. Poor living conditions of the animals and inadequate veterinary care are examples of the sad mistreatment of the animal population. You can't go wrong at the Queen Saovabha Institute Snake Farm in Silom, as the staff takes good care of their snakes and they have a job of informing the public about the risks associated with them. Another nice family attraction is Siam Ocean World in Siam Square. It has a steep price tag, but at least you get to see the largest aquarium in Southeast Asia.\n\n\n=== \"Colonial\" architecture ===\nAlthough Thailand was never colonised, due to the desire of Kings Rama IV (1804-1868) and Rama V (1868-1910) to modernise Thailand based on Western models, visitors might be surprised to find that Bangkok has no shortage of European-style buildings that would not be out of place in other Southeast Asian capitals. While other Southeast Asian capitals tend to be dominated by buildings of a specific architectural style depending on their colonial history (e.g., French in Hanoi, British in Yangon), Bangkok has a mix of buildings with architectural styles from different parts of Europe. For instance, Hua Lamphong Railway Station, Bangkok's main railway station, was designed by Italian architects and hence built in an Italian neo-Renaissance style. Other notable European-style buildings include the Italian Old Customs House, the Danish East Asiatic Company headquarters, and the Art Deco-style General Post Office. One of the most interesting European-influenced buildings is the Chakri Maha Prasat Hall in the Grand Palace, which was built mostly in an Italian neoclassical style, but with a traditional Thai roof. The greatest concentration of European buildings can be found in Rattanakosin and Yaowarat.\n\n\n=== Itineraries ===\nOne day in Bangkok \u2014 if you have just one day to spare and want to catch a feel for the city\nRattanakosin Tour \u2014 a quick tour along Bangkok's famed historic district\nYaowarat and Phahurat Tour \u2014 a full-day walking tour through this multicultural district\n\n\n== Do ==\nIndividual listings can be found in Bangkok's district articles\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\n\nAll of Thailand's major festivals are celebrated in Bangkok. New Year is celebrated three times. There's the new year following the Gregorian calendar at January 1, celebrated with a huge fireworks display at Ratchaprasong intersection. Then there's Chinese New Year in January or February, with grandiose and colourful Chinese lion and dragon processions in Yaowarat. Finally, the water festivities of Songkran celebrate the traditional Thai New Year in the middle of April. Khao San Road degenerates into a war zone as farangs and locals duke it out with super soakers. More respectable celebrations are held at Sanam Luang, where the revered Phra Phuttha Sihing image is displayed and bathed by devotees, and at the Wisut Kasat intersection, where a Miss Songkran beauty contest is held and accompanied by merit-making and entertainment.\nDuring the Royal Ploughing Ceremony in May, farmers believe that an ancient Brahman ritual, conducted at Sanam Luang, is able to forecast whether the coming growing season will be bountiful or not. The event dates back to the Sukhothai Kingdom and was re-introduced in 1960 by King Bhumibol Adulyadej. It is considered the official commencement of the rice-growing season (and the rainy season). Nowadays, the ceremony is conducted by King Maha Vajiralongkorn. Loi Krathong (\u0e25\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e01\u0e23\u0e30\u0e17\u0e07), the Festival of Lights, usually takes place in November. Krathongs are floating rafts made from lotus flowers and banana leaves with a lighted candle and incense on top. On the night of the full moon, Thais send their krathong down a river, canal or pond, and the owner's bad luck carries away along with it insuring a fresh start. Celebrations take place all over town with parades, concerts and beauty pageants. Loi Krathong coincides with the Lanna festival Yi Peng (\u0e22\u0e35\u0e48\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e07). At this festival, a multitude of Lanna-style paper lanterns are launched into the air. Lumphini Park is the best place to launch a krathong down the pond or to launch a paper lantern into the sky.\nThe Trooping of the Colours in early December is an impressive annual event, held in the Royal Plaza near the equestrian statue of King Rama V in Dusit. Dressed in colourful uniforms, amid much pomp and ceremony, members of the elite Royal Guards swear allegiance to the King and march past members of the Royal Family. December 5 is Father's Day, the former King's birthday, and Ratchadamri Road and the Grand Palace are elaborately decorated and illuminated.\n\n\n=== Canals ===\nUntil the late 19th century, Bangkok (just like Ayutthaya) was known as \"Venice of the East\". Most people lived near or on the water and an intricate network of canals (khlong) was the primary mode of transport for the city's inhabitants. Most canals have since been paved over, but plenty of them remain and some still function as transport routes as of this day. The traditional canal-side way of life has almost vanished, but as Thonburi was largely undeveloped until the 20th century, there is still some authenticity to be found. Floating markets had completely disappeared by the 20th century, but have been reinstated for tourism purposes and are a fun visit.\nYou can see the Chao Phraya River and the backwaters of the city by canal tour. Most of these boat trips start at the eastern bank of the Chao Phraya and then ply through the backwaters of Thonburi taking in Wat Arun, the Royal Barges National Museum, a floating market and some other minor attractions. More information about these canal tours can be found in the Thonburi article. At 1,000 baht or more, they are quite expensive. You can also negotiate a price with individual boat drivers. Damnoen Saduak is a floating market that often appears in tourist brochures of Bangkok, but in practice it is 109 km (68 mi) west of Bangkok and has to be visited by bus from the Southern Bus Terminal.\nProbably just as fun is to take the public express boat along the Chao Phraya River. You can get off anywhere between the Thewet and Sathorn (Taksin) piers as there are many things to see in all of these neighbourhoods. You can even take the express boat all the way north to Nonthaburi in the morning, enjoy the afternoon in this laid-back traditional urban town, and take the boat back around rush hour. Another option is to get on one of the free hotel shuttle boats at Sathorn (Taksin) pier and have a bite at one of the associated caf\u00e9s. In the evenings, Asiatique has a free shuttle boat from Sathorn (Taksin) pier to the new shopping centre downriver. A good place to see beautiful sunsets over the river.\n\n\n=== Pampering ===\n\nSpas, traditionally, were towns where public baths, hospitals or hotels were built on top of mineral springs so that people could come and make use of the healing properties found in the water and its mud for medical purposes. These days, a spa doesn't have to be a town built on natural thermal springs. It can be a place anywhere that anyone can go to, to relax in tranquil surroundings with a variety of treatment administered to recontour and rejuvenate the body and mind.\nSpas were unheard of until the 1990s, but now Bangkok is one of the highest ranking spa destinations in the world with an amazing array of treatments. All self-respecting luxury hotels in Bangkok have a spa that at least offers a traditional Thai massage. Prices are exorbitant, but they offer some of the best treatments in the city. Well-regarded spas at exceptionally high rates are given at the splurge hotels in Silom; particularly the spa at the Dusit Thani Hotel stands out. Independent spas offer much the same experience, but offer much more competitive rates. Figure around 1,000 baht/hr for most treatments.\nThe ubiquitous little massage shops found on every street corner in town offer the best value for money, but the smallest range of services, with offerings usually limited to massage only. Particularly Khao San Road and Sukhumvit have plenty of these popular places. It is fairly easy to distinguish legitimate massage shops from more dubious places (where massaging is only a front for prostitution); the real deal will charge 250-400 baht for a typical 2-hr massage and will often have a row of beefy farmers' daughters in white coats working on customers' feet in public view, while the other kind has wispy girls in evening dresses wearing too much make-up and saying \"hello handsome\" to every passing male.\n\n\n=== Muay Thai ===\nMuay Thai is both a combat sport and a means of self-defence. Contestants are allowed to use almost any part of the body for fighting: feet, elbows, legs, knees and shoulders. There are two venues in Bangkok to see this sport in action: Lumpinee Boxing Stadium in Silom and Ratchadamnoen Stadium in Rattanakosin. Sessions can take the whole evening and it's not that bad if you come in slightly late as the more interesting fights tend to happen at the end. The playing of traditional music during the bouts is enjoyable as well. A downer is the steep 1,000-2,000 baht entry fee for foreigners. Thais chip in for 100 baht or less.\nIf you want to see Muay Thai for free, go to the MBK Fight Night outside MBK Center near Siam Square. Fights take place the last Wednesday evening of each month (starts at 18:00, lasts until around 21:00). Another option is to walk to the end of Soi Rambuttri into an alley known as Trok Kasap (near Khao San Road). Foreigners are getting classes in Muay Thai out in the open there, and many tourists generally sit on a bench in front of it to look at the action. Besides looking, this is an excellent place to do some Muay Thai yourself.\n\n\n=== Cycling ===\nBicycles can be rented for free in Rattanakosin, but cyclists are officially not allowed to leave the set route along the island. Even when following the route, it's still not for the faint of heart.\nIf renting your own bicycle, avoid the main roads and cycle through the vast system of small streets and alleys. You can cycle through the backstreets of Yaowarat, but you might want to think twice before making a turn. You can also experience life in Bangkok's countryside by cycling through green paddy fields, orchid farms and lotus fields. Bang Kachao, in brochures often referred to as the \"Bangkok Jungle\", is Bangkok's last green frontier. It's a semi-island across the river from Bangkok with few cars and buildings, and a great destination for cycling.\nCyclists are treated as pedestrians, so you can use your bicycle to explore parks, temple complexes, markets and the more quiet residential areas in eastern Bangkok. In more crowded places you can cycle on the pavement. Exploring by bicycle has all the advantages of going by foot, combined with a much greater travel radius and a cooling breeze. Cycling is the best way to discover the city up close, but as there are safety issues involved, you need some insider knowledge on where to cycle. Because of this, many opt for a bicycle tour organised by an operator.\n\n Bangkok Biking, Baan Sri Kung 350/123, Soi 71, Rama III Rd, \u260f +66 2-285 3955.

Bicycle tours, some of which are GPS-guided, and bicycle rentals. Small groups, max 6. Safe and fun. 350-1,500 baht. \n\n\n=== Theatre ===\nThe Aksra Theatre in the King Power Complex Building in Pratunam holds spectacular shows that are a combination of Thai traditional puppet shows, orchestral performances and classical dances. The Joe Louis Theatre in the Asiatique is completely dedicated to the art of operating Hun Lakhon Lek puppets. One segment has the puppets interact with audience members, which is a fun activity with children. Both Aksra and Joe Louis feature stories taken from the Ramayana epic.\nOf a completely different nature are Bangkok's famous transvestite shows. These cabarets generally take about 2 hours, and besides singing, dancing, glamour and costumes, there's also has some comedy thrown in. The most famous of these is the Calypso Cabaret at Ratchathewi intersection with two sessions every evening at the Asia Hotel. An alternative is Mambo Cabaret, once in Sukhumvit but now at a new location far off the tourist path in Yan Nawa. Three shows are given each evening. Always book these shows a couple of days in advance as they usually sell out.\n\n\n=== Entertainment ===\nBangkok is a great place to go to the cinema. Compared to Western countries, the cost of a ticket is a complete bargain at around 120 baht. Most cinemas have world-class standards and show the latest Hollywood and Thai releases. They are up to par with the latest technological innovations in the film industry, so expect to wear 3D glasses for some of the latest Hollywood releases. You can also visit the IMAX Theatre in Siam Paragon. Thai films can be seen by foreigners as they are usually shown with English subtitles. For non-mainstream cinema, House Samyan (in Samyan Mitrtown shopping mall) and APEX (in Siam Square) offer art films with English subtitles.\nFor other means of entertainment, Ratchadaphisek is a newly created entertainment paradise. Its bowling centres are of a superb standard with some of them resembling the interior of a nightclub. Dance while you play in style. Private karaoke lounges are usually connected to these bowling centres and are available at major hotels. There's even an ice skating rink and a top-class go-kart track in this district. As Ratchadaphisek is mostly aimed at locals, you might want to go to similar venues in Siam Square or Sukhumvit. Horse races are held on Sundays at two alternate turf clubs: the Royal Turf Club of Thailand in Dusit and the Royal Bangkok Sports Club on Henri Dunant Road near Siam Square.\n\n\n=== Aerobics dance ===\nBangkok is a good place for aerobics dancing. Many places in Bangkok, for example, supermarkets or public parks, offer free outdoor aerobics classes. These classes usually start in the morning at 06:00 or in the evening at 18:00, and the session would last for one hour. Wear appropriate clothing. These classes don't require Thai language skill because instructor rarely uses verbal cues. Aside from exercising you can also meet the community of local people and foreigners.\nFor supermarkets, you can expect to find classes in Lotus or Big C. They only have classes in the evening, and are usually held in or nearby the parking areas. For public parks, there are many places but the most famous one is in the Lumphini park in Silom district. They have classes in the morning and in the evening at the ceremonial gate.\n\n\n== Learn ==\nLearning opportunities are abundant in Bangkok. Thai cuisine is a favourite of many, and plenty of cooking schools provide half-day classes that provide a nice break from the day-to-day sightseeing monotony. Silom and Khao San Road particularly have some of the better-known Thai cooking schools.\nMeditation, the essence of 'pure' Buddhism, can be practised at any temple in Thailand. In addition, there are centres in Bangkok that cater specifically to foreigners wishing to learn and practise. The International Buddhist Meditation Centre inside Wat Mahathat in Rattanakosin provides free meditation classes three times a day. If you can understand Thai well enough, you may wish to go on your own retreat at a quiet temple on the outskirts of Bangkok. To pay for your stay, it is appreciated that you assist the resident monks on their morning alms rounds.\nThe Wat Pho temple in Rattanakosin offers well-regarded Thai massage courses. They are used to conducting classes in English.\n\n\n=== Universities ===\n1 Chulalongkorn University. The oldest and most prestigious institute of higher education in Thailand.   \n2 National Institute of Development Administration. The only university in Thailand that focuses on business education.   (updated Dec 2023)\n3 Assumption University. Thailand's most prestigious private Catholic university.   (updated Dec 2023)\n4 Ramkhamhaeng University. Thailand's largest public university.   (updated Dec 2023)\n\n\n== Buy ==\n\n\n=== Money ===\nGetting cash in Bangkok is relatively easy, see below. Also, credit cards are widely accepted at larger establishments.\n\n\n==== Cash advance ====\nYou can avoid expensive ATM withdrawals or carrying a lot of cash for currency exchange by going to a bank branch (mostly Bangkok Bank) and doing cash advance with your credit card and passport.\n\n\n==== Currency exchange ====\nThe two most competitive money changers are at Phaya Thai station, the end of the Airport Rail Link, right outside the ticket area near the ticket vending machines. They have rates 0.1\u20140.2% (markup) off the interbank exchange rates for all major currencies, i.e. you can change money directly here when you arrive and leave Thailand via Bangkok. A great alternative to the overly expensive ATM withdrawals.\nSuperrich Thailand (\"Superrich Green\" and Superrich 1965 (\"Superrich Orange\") are two competing currency exchange change that offer decent rates of exchange, with their respective head offices in Pathum Wan (within walking distance of Central World, both across the street from each other) usually offering better rates than their other branches.\n\n\n==== ATMs ====\nATMs are spread all over the city, especially in central areas. All ATMs charge a commission for using foreign cards at ATMs of at least 220 baht. \n\n\n=== Shopping ===\nIndividual listings can be found in Bangkok's district articles\n\nDump a teenager in Siam Square with a few thousand baht and she'll stay occupied for the rest of the week! Siam Square is the place to shop in Bangkok; the small sois of Siam Square have dozens of small designer boutiques. MBK Center and Siam Center are the most popular shopping malls, as they sell fashion well below Western rates. Siam Paragon, EmQuartier in Sukhumvit, ICONSIAM in Khlong San, Central Embassy in Phloen Chit and the shopping plazas at Ratchaprasong feel even larger, but are much quieter, as most local Thais cannot afford the Guccis and Louis Vuittons on sale there. Ladies will also feel well at home in the Emporium next to EmQuartier.\nJust take a few steps out of your hotel and Bangkok feels like a huge street market. Sukhumvit has the usual souvenirs, T-shirts and other tacky tourist junk. Browsing Khao San Road's roadside stalls is particularly good for clothing and accessories, many of them for a bargain. While many of these stalls still cater to the traditional hippie crowd, they have been slowly gentrifying to appeal to a broader audience. The nearby Banglamphu Market sells cheap knock-offs of everything, just like the night markets in Silom and Rattanakosin.\nIn the weekends, the Chatuchak Weekend Market in Phahonyothin is a must as its 8,000 stalls together form the largest market in Southeast Asia. Shoppers can buy just about everything from clothing to potted plants and everything in between \u2014 it is a paradise for browsers and bargain-hunters alike. A weekday alternative is Pratunam, one of the city's renowned garment markets. Clothes shopping here goes on wholesale, and you're even cheaper off if you buy in bulk. At Pantip Plaza you can buy computer-related stuff from branded laptops to pirated DVDs.\nYaowarat and Phahurat give a more authentic experience, although many stores sell the cheap teen accessories found elsewhere as well. Just sitting at a plastic chair and watching daily commerce evolve is a fun activity in itself. Phahurat is the best destination for fabrics, available in all colours and sizes. Pak Khlong Talat is a surprisingly fun wholesale market for cut flowers and vegetables. If you're a morning person, visit it around 03:00, when new flowers from upcountry arrive and the marketplace is beautifully illuminated.\nThonburi, being one of the least developed areas of Bangkok, is the best place to experience what the city used to be like. A must is the weekends-only Taling Chan Floating Market, which feels at least somewhat authentic as it blends a rural market with the canal side way of life. Wang Lang Market is an undiscovered gem with strictly local prices. The other side of the river, Rattanakosin, has everything a good Buddhist would need, be it amulets, monk bowls or human-sized Buddha statues.\nFor antiques, Silom is the place to go, as most potential buyers stay there in expensive hotels. River City in Yaowarat is the largest antique mall of the city, and priced to match. Gold and gems are popular buys, but be careful: know what you're looking for such as quality of workmanship and gold/stones and what something like it costs back home. If possible by prior research, not street vendor recommendation, go to respected jewellers, and polish your bargaining skills. Many tourists buy worthless pieces of cut glass believing it to be valuable gems. Others get jewellery or gems at unjustified costs. Never let tuk-tuk drivers take you to a gem/jewelry store; more often than not, you'll be ripped off and they're getting a commission for taking you there. The same advice applies to tailoring shops; you can get a custom-made suit at low prices, but you have to know where to go, as many tailors provide bad quality \u2014 see the sidebar for advice on finding a good tailor.\nBrowsing second hand English-language books can best be done on Khao San Road. For new releases, there are plenty of chain stores in shopping plazas, including Asia Books, B2S, Bookazine and Kinokuniya. There's a particularly wide array of books on Asian culture and history; some have a good selection of foreign newspapers and magazines as well.\n\n\n== Eat ==\nIndividual listings can be found in Bangkok's district articles\n\nBangkok boasts a stunning 50,000 places to eat; not only thousands of Thai restaurants, but a wide selection of world-class international cuisine too. With the rise of the expat community and high expenditure for local Thais, Bangkok has fast become a gastronomical paradise. Prices are generally high by Thai standards, but cheap by international standards. A good meal is unlikely to cost more than 300 baht, although there are a few restaurants (primarily in hotels) where you can easily spend 10 times this.\nSukhumvit is known for many of popular restaurants but the business district of Silom is now littered with many of Bangkok's top dining destinations. Practically every cuisine in the world is represented here, be it French, Lebanese, Mexican, Vietnamese, or fusion combining many of these together in a quirky, but delicious mix. Bangkok's Italian town is Soi Ton Son near Siam Square. Of course, for those on a budget, street stalls abound with simple Thai dishes at around 30 baht. There are especially plenty of budget restaurants in Khao San Road.\nThere are plenty of vegetarian restaurants in the more tourist-friendly parts of town (especially in hippie district Khao San Road). Vegetarian dishes are also readily available on the menus of regular restaurants. On request, even typical street restaurants will easily cook a vegetarian equivalent of a popular Thai dish for you. Ask for \"jay\" food to leave the meat out of the dish. For example, \"khao pad\" is fried rice and \"khao pad jay\" is vegetarian fried rice. The most common animal product used would be oyster sauce. To avoid it, say \"mai ao naam man hoi\". Be aware that all street noodle vendors use meat broth for noodle soup.\nFor Muslims, the alleys around Haroon Mosque in the Bang Rak area are home to many Muslim families, and hence full of stalls selling halal food. Another good place to find halal food is the Ramkhamhaeng Night Market, located next to the campus of Ramkhamhaeng University.\u200b\nDon't miss out on a cold ice cream in hot Bangkok. Western chain stores Dairy Queen and Swensen's have booths in many malls and shopping centres. Or better yet, try an exotic fruit-flavoured ice cream at an Iberry shop. Their ice creams are tasty, cheap and safe to eat. Korean-style shaved ice has become very popular, and local chain After You has many branches in Bangkok, and is a very popular hangout spot among Thai youths and young adults.\n\n\n=== Street food ===\nWhile generally not particularly high class, street food is among the most delicious food and there even is a venue that earned a Michelin star in their 2018 guide. The venues can be found all over Bangkok\u2014wherever you're staying, you rarely have to walk more than 100 m for a cart or street restaurant. Many street vendors sell satay (\u0e2a\u0e30\u0e40\u0e15\u0e4a\u0e30) with hot sauce for 5-10 baht a piece.\nOne of Thailand's national dishes you can try is pad thai (\u0e1c\u0e31\u0e14\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22), stir-fried rice noodles with eggs, fish sauce, tamarind juice and red chili pepper. It can be prepared for you on one of the ubiquitous carts or served in a street restaurant for about 50 baht. You can order it with chicken (kai) or shrimps (kung). Another one of Thailand's national dishes you should try is tom yam kung (\u0e15\u0e49\u0e21\u0e22\u0e33\u0e01\u0e38\u0e49\u0e07), a sour soup with prawns, lemongrass and galangal\u2014beware, as it is very spicy! Khao man kai (\u0e02\u0e49\u0e32\u0e27\u0e21\u0e31\u0e19\u0e44\u0e01\u0e48) is another popular street food. You can identify it at stalls displaying boiled chicken. Served with a bowl of fragrant chicken soup is a mound of rice topped with sliced chicken pieces and cucumber. Side sauces are spicy and go well with the bland chicken and rice. You can sometimes add optional liver and gizzard if that is your taste. If you like sweets, try to find a kanom roti (\u0e42\u0e23\u0e15\u0e35) street vendor. The crepe-like dessert is filled with sweetened condensed milk, lots of sugar and can also have bananas inside. Also fun to watch them being made.\n\nKhao San Road is known for its carts selling bugs\u2014yes, insects. They are deep fried, nutritious and quite tasty with the soy sauce that is sprayed on them. Types available: scorpions, water beetles, grasshoppers, crickets, bamboo larvae, mealworms and some seasonal specialties. Break off the legs from grasshoppers and crickets or they will get stuck in your throat.\nAround the corner from Khao San Road in front of the department store and supermarkets the street is lined with a myriad stalls selling all manner of tempting delicacies: sweets and crackers, coconut jellies, candied fruits, fish balls on skewers, tamarind sweets dipped in chili and sugar and a host of other delights.\n\n\n=== Ethnic cuisine ===\nMain article: Thai cuisine\nThai dishes can roughly be categorised into central, northern, northeastern and southern cuisine. What's so great about Bangkok is that all these cuisines are present. Isaan food (from the northeast of Thailand) is popular; generally street restaurants serve on plenty of small plates that can be shared. Som tam (\u0e2a\u0e49\u0e21\u0e15\u0e33) is a salad made from shredded and pounded raw papaya \u2014 again, it is spicy, but oh so delicious. If you want to dine the Isaan way, also order some khao niew (sticky rice), kai yang (grilled chicken) and moo yang (grilled pork). Isaan food is very spicy; say mai pet or pet nit noy to tone it down. Southern Thai cuisine is also worth it; many of them have congregated around Wang Lang in Thonburi. At least try the massaman curry (\u0e41\u0e01\u0e07\u0e21\u0e31\u0e2a\u0e21\u0e31\u0e48\u0e19), it's delicious.\nOne of the best places to go to for Chinese food is Yaowarat. It has a range of street stalls and cheap restaurants selling expensive delicacies at affordable prices. Soi Phadung Dao is the best street for huge seafood restaurants. Try 1 kg of huge barbecued prawns for about 300 baht. That being said, due to the large Thai-Chinese population in Bangkok, Chinese influences pervade much of Bangkok's culinary scene, and even outside Chinatown, many of Bangkok's most famous street food stalls are owned by ethnic Chinese. As most of Yaowarat's residents are local-born Thai-Chinese who have been in Thailand for multiple generations, the food there has been significantly localised and differs noticeably from the original versions of the dishes you will find in China. For more authentic Chinese cuisine that is closer to what is served in China, go to Pracha Rat Bamphen in Hwai Khwang, which is home to a large number of immigrants and expatriates from China, and a large number of Chinese restaurants serving various regional Chinese cuisines to cater to that crowd.\nPhahurat, Bangkok's Little India, has some decent Indian restaurants.\n\n\n=== Fine dining ===\nBangkok is arguably the best city in Southeast Asia for fine dining, and there is no shortage of options for those who can afford to splurge the cash. Fine dining options in Bangkok include French, Italian, Chinese, Indian, Japanese and, of course, Thai. Although exorbitant by Thai standards, fine dining in Bangkok is very affordable compared to similar options in developed countries, and even the most expensive fine dining should not cost you more than 5000 baht per head.\n\n\n=== Dinner cruises ===\nDinner cruises on the Chao Phraya River are a touristy (but fun) way of spotting floodlit temples while chowing down on seafood and watching Thai cultural performances. Most operate buffet-style and the quality of the food is so-so, but there's lots of it and it's not too spicy. While the river can give a romantic experience, it can also be dirty and smelly with lots of plants floating around.\nDrinks and tips are usually not included in the listed prices below. Always make a reservation before heading out to the pier. There are many competing operators, most of them depart from the River City pier next to the Si Phraya Express Boat pier. Major operators include:\n\n Chao Phraya Princess, 723 Supakarn Building, Charoen Nakhorn Rd, \u260f +66 2 860-3700. Departure 19:30. Large operator with four modern air-conditioned boats seating up to 250 people. Departure from River City pier. 1,300 baht. \n Loy Nava, 1367 Charoen Nakhorn Rd, \u260f +66 2 437-4932. Departure 18:00 or 20:10 daily. This dinner cruise heads out with 70-seater rice barges. Departure from Si Phraya pier (near River City), and there is a free pickup from most hotels. 1,400 baht. \n Manohra, 257 Charoen Nakhorn Rd, \u260f +66 2 477-0770. Departure 19:30 daily. These restored Thai rice barges seat 40 people. Departure from Marriott Resort pier, with an optional pick-up from Saphan Taksin BTS station. 1,250-1,990 baht. \n Wan Fah, 292 Rachawongse Rd, \u260f +66 2 222-8679. Departure 19:00 daily. These 2-hr dinner cruises include a set meal of farang-friendly Thai food and seafood, live music and Thai classical dancing. Departure from River City. 1,000 baht. \n Yok Yor Marina, 885 Somdet Chao Phraya Soi 17, \u260f +66 2 863-0565. Departure 20:00. Operated by the famous seafood restaurant, this is a much more local (and cheaper) option than the tourist cruises: pay a 160 baht \"boat fee\" and then order off the menu at normal restaurant prices. Departure from Yok Yor Marina on the Thonburi side of the river. There is a free shuttle service from Saphan Taksin BTS station. \n\n\n== Drink ==\nIndividual listings can be found in Bangkok's district articles\n\nBangkok's nightlife is infamously wild, but it's not quite what it used to be. Due to social order campaigns, there have been quite a few crack-downs on opening hours, nudity, and drug use. Most restaurants, bars and clubs are now forced to close at 01:00, although quite a few are allowed to stay open till 02:00 or later. Informal roadside bars do stay open all night, particularly in Sukhumvit and Khao San Road. You must carry your passport for ID checks and police occasionally raid bars and discos, subjecting all customers to drug tests and searches, though these mostly occur at places that cater for high-society Thais.\nOne of Bangkok's main party districts is Silom, home not only to perhaps the world's most famous go-go bar strip, Patpong, but plenty of more legitimate establishments catering to all tastes. For a drink with a view, the open-air rooftop bars of Vertigo and Sirocco are particularly impressive. A large number of superhip and more expensive bars and nightclubs can be found in the higher sois of Sukhumvit, particularly the hip area of Thong Lo (Soi 55).\nHippie hangout Khao San Road is also slowly gentrifying and a score of young artsy Thai teenagers have also made their mark there. Going out in Khao San Road is mostly casual, sitting at a roadside bar watching people pass by, but the Gazebo Club is a nightclub that stays open till the sun gets up. Most of the younger Thais prefer to congregate around Ratchadaphisek, home to the Royal City Avenue strip of nightclubs where you can find popular nightclubs like 808, Route 66, Cosmic Cafe, and more.\nRCA, the Royal City Avenue strip, is home to much more than nightclubs. You will be able to find fun karaoke clubs, go-carting, arcades and bars like the Overtone Music Cave which is a place where music students to perform. The Overtone Music Cave is frequently visited by recording artists as well as music students and is becoming a real Bangkok music hot spot.\nSmoking is forbidden in all restaurants, bars and nightclubs, whether air-conditioned or non-air-conditioned. It is enforced at some venues, but the ordinance is flouted in areas such as Nana Plaza.\n\n\n=== Go-go and beer bars ===\n\nThe go-go bar is an institution of Bangkok's \"naughty nightlife\". In a typical go-go, several dozen dancers in bikinis (or less) crowd the stage, shuffling back and forth to loud music and trying to catch the eye of punters in the audience. Some also put on shows where girls perform on stage, but these are generally tamer than you'd expect. Nudity, for example, is actually illegal. These are no Western- or US-style strip clubs. Expect a stage in the middle with seating all around, and 5-10 girls just dancing or standing around on stage in various states of undress. No lap dances, but girls will sit with you for the price of a lady drink. In a beer bar, there are no stages and the girls wear \"street clothes\".\nIf this sounds like a thinly veiled veneer for prostitution, it is. Although some point to the large number of American GIs during the Vietnam War as the point of origin of the Thai sex trade, others have claimed that current Thai attitudes towards sexuality have deeper roots in Thai history. Both go-go and beer bars are squarely aimed at the foreign tourists and it's fairly safe to assume that most if not all Thais in them are on the take. That said, it's perfectly OK to check out these shows without partaking, and there are more and more curious couples and even the occasional tour group attending. The most famous is around Patpong in Silom, but the action has largely shifted to Nana Entertainment Plaza (Soi 4) and Soi Cowboy (Soi 23) in Sukhumvit. Soi 33 is packed with hostess bars, which are more upscale than the Soi Cowboy and Nana Plaza bars and do not feature go-go dancing. Before heading to these places, be sure to read the Stay safe section for some additional advice.\nAs go-go bars close around 01:00, there are so-called after-hour clubs that stay open till the sun comes up. They are not hard to find\u2014just hop in a taxi. Taxi drivers are eager to drive you there, as they get a hefty commission from club owners to bring you to them. You might even get the ride for free. These clubs generally feel grim and edgy, and there are so-called \"freelancers\" among the girls (prostitutes). Some well known after-hour clubs include Bossy Club in Pratunam, Spicy Club near Siam Square and the always famous Thermae on Sukhumvit between sois 15 and 17 in the basement underneath the Ruamchit short-time hotel.\n\n\n=== Gay nightlife ===\nThais are generally accepting of homosexuality and Bangkok has a very active gay nightlife scene, concentrated in Silom's Soi 2, Soi 4 and a short strip of gay go-go bars known as Soi Twilight (off Surawong Road). Gay strip bars all have free entry, but charge an extra 150 baht or so for drinks. The most popular gay drinking bars are The Balcony and Telephone Pub at Silom Soi 4, which are busy until 23:00. For the disco crowd, DJ Station and its late-night neighbour G.O.D. Club (Silom Soi 2) are packed every night beginning around 23:00. Between 17:00-22:00 over 200 men from around the world cruise, swim, dine, and party at the nearby Babylon, considered by many to be the best gay sauna in the world. Babylon also has budget and luxury accommodation.\nAll of these bars and clubs are aimed at gay men and the lesbian scene is much more low-key. Since the opening of full-time lesbian bars Zeta and E-Fun, a small lesbian community is starting to emerge along Royal City Avenue. Lesla (near Phahonyothin) is a lesbian bar that is open on Saturday nights only. Bring along your passport for entrance age checking (they do not allow people under 20 years old).\nIn a league of their own are Bangkok's numerous transsexuals (kathoey), both pre- and post-operative, popularly known as ladyboys. A part of Thai popular culture for ages, kathoey face increasing prejudice as Thailand imports rigid Western gender concepts. Many male Westerners obsess about the risks of \"mistaking\" a ladyboy for a \"real\" woman, in the fear that being attracted to them would make of them homosexuals. Tired clich\u00e9s about \"tall, large-handed, large breasted transsexuals with garish makeup\" are belied by the fact that most kathoeys strive to blend in with the general population. However, legal change of gender is not possible in Thailand, which means they find it difficult to access many \"respectable\" jobs. Some work in the famed transvestite cabarets and there are some dedicated kathoey bars as well.\nSome Thai regulars in the gay nightlife scene skirt the fine line between partying and prostitution, and the Western visitor, being considered richer, is expected to pay any food and drink expenses and perhaps provide some \"taxi money\" in the morning. It's usually wise to ask a boy you pick up in a bar or club if he is after money, as it's not uncommon for them to start demanding money after sex.\n\n\n== Sleep ==\nIndividual listings can be found in Bangkok's district articles\n\nBangkok has a vast range of accommodation, including some of the best hotels in the world \u2014 but also some of the worst dives. Broadly speaking, Khao San Road is backpacker city; the riverside of Silom and Thonburi is home to The Oriental and The Peninsula respectively, often ranked among the best in the world, and priced to match, Most of the city's moderate and expensive hotels can be found in Siam Square, Sukhumvit and Silom, though they also have their share of budget options.\nWhen choosing your digs, think of the amount of luxury you want to pay for \u2014 air-conditioning can be advised, as temperatures don't drop below 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) at night. Also pay careful attention to Skytrain, metro and express boat access, as a well-placed station or pier could make your stay in Bangkok much more comfortable. In general, accommodation in Bangkok is cheap. It's possible to have a decent double room with hot shower and air-conditioning for about 500 baht/night. If you want more luxury, expect to pay around 1,500 baht for a double room in the main tourist areas. Even staying at one of Bangkok's top hotels only costs around 5,000 baht \u2014 the price of a standard double room in much of Europe.\nOne Bangkok hotel phenomenon is the guest fee of around 500 baht added to your bill if you bring along a newly found friend for the night. Some hotels even refuse Thai guests altogether, especially common in Khao San Road. These rules are obviously aimed at controlling local sex workers, which is why hotel security will usually hold onto your guest's ID card for the duration of the visit, but some hotels will also apply it to Western visitors \u2014 or, more embarrassingly, try to apply it to your Thai partner. Look for the signs, or, if in doubt, ask the staff before check-in.\n\n\n== Stay safe ==\nGiven its size, Bangkok is surprisingly safe, with violent crimes like mugging and robbery unusual. Most violent crime in Bangkok is connected to disputes between organized crime syndicates; if you do not bother them, they generally will not bother you. Generally speaking, the tourists who get into trouble are the ones who get into drunken fights. One of the biggest dangers are motorbikes who ride on pavements at speed, go through red lights, undertake buses as they stop to let passengers off and generally drive far too fast especially through stationary traffic. If you are going to hire a bike, make sure you have insurance in case you are injured. You may be the world's best driver but you'll meet many of the world's worst drivers in Thailand.\nBangkok does have more than its fair share of scams, and many individuals in the tourist business do not hesitate to overcharge unwary visitors. As a rule of thumb, it is wise to decline all offers made by someone who appears to be a friendly local giving a hapless tourist some local advice. Short-changing tourists is reasonably common as well, don't hesitate to complain if you are not given the correct change.\nNever get in a tuk-tuk if someone else is trying to get you into one. Most Bangkok locals do not approach foreigners without an ulterior motive.\n\n\n=== Scams ===\n\nThere are dozens of scams in Bangkok, but by far the most widely practiced is the gem scam. Always beware of tuk-tuk drivers offering all-day tours for prices as low as 10 baht. You may indeed be taken on a full-day tour, but you will end up only visiting one gem and souvenir shop after another. Don't buy any products offered by pushy salespeople \u2014 the \"gems\" you can supposedly sell overseas for huge profits are pretty much always worthless pieces of cut glass and the suits are of deplorable quality. The tuk-tuk driver gets a commission if you buy something \u2014 and fuel coupons even if you don't. Unless the idea of travelling by tuk-tuk appeals to you, it's almost always cheaper, more comfortable and less hassle to take a metered taxi.\nBe highly skeptical when an English-speaking Thai at a popular tourist attraction approaches you out of the blue, telling that your intended destination is closed or offering discount admissions. Temples are almost always free (the main exceptions are Wat Phra Kaeo and Wat Pho) and open just about every day of the year. Anyone telling you otherwise, even if they have an official-looking identification card, is most likely out to scam you, especially if they suggest a tuk-tuk ride to some alternate sights to see until the sight re-opens. At paid admission sites, verify the operating hours at the ticket window.\n\nIf you entered one of these tuk-tuks, touts will often drop you off at a certain place, such as a genuine Buddhist temple. Here you will find a man that claims to be an official, and he guides you in a certain direction. There you will find another \"official\" who also claims that a certain attraction is closed. This way, a tourist hears the same statement by multiple people, and is more eager to believe that his or her intended destination indeed is closed. Never get involved with these scammers or believe any of their statements.\nWhen getting a taxi, it is a good idea to hail a moving taxi from the main road, walk a short distance out of a major tourist area before looking for one, or use a ride-hailing app. This is no guarantee of honesty, but greatly increases your chances of finding an honest driver, of which there are plenty in Bangkok, even if it sometimes seems that every driver is on the make. There are some taxi drivers who switch off their meters, and insist on an unreasonable price. Most of the untrustworthy drivers are the ones standing still in tourist areas. Another important rule of thumb is to insist on the meter for taxis and agree on a price in advance for tuk-tuks. If they refuse, or quote unreasonable prices, just walk out and get a different one as they're rarely in short supply. The Thai phrase to ask a driver to use the meter is mee-TOE, khap if you're male and mee-TOE, kha if you're female. Don't ask taxi drivers for recommendations, they'll take you to the place that pays the highest commission.\nAlso beware of private bus companies offering direct trips from Bangkok to other cities with \"VIP\" buses. There are a lot of scams performed by these private bus companies. The so-called direct VIP trips may end up changing three or four uncomfortable minibuses to the destination, and the 10-11-hour trip may well turn into 17\u201318 hr. Instead, try to book public Transport Co. buses from the main bus terminals. It's worth the extra shoe-leather, as there have been reports of robberies on private buses as well.\n\n\n=== Go-go bars ===\nBangkok is known for its go-go bars and the prostitution that comes along with it. Some aspects of prostitution are illegal (e.g. soliciting, pimping), but enforcement is rare, and brothels are common. It's not illegal to pay for sex or to pay a \"barfine\" (a fee the bar collects if you want to take an employee away).\nThailand's age of consent is 15 but a higher minimum age of 18 applies in the case of prostitutes. Thai penalties for sex with minors are harsh, and even if your partner is over the age of consent in Thailand, tourists who have sex with minors may be prosecuted by their home country. As far as ascertaining the age of your partner goes, all adult Thais must carry an identity card, which will state that they were born in 2550 or earlier if they were over the age of 18 on 1 Jan 2025 (in the Thai calendar, 2025 is the year 2568).\nMany hotels retain the ID cards of prostitutes for the duration of their visit. Whilst most prostitutes are employed by bars or similar businesses, some are \"freelancers\". Petty theft and other problems, such as slipping the customer sleep drugs, are allegedly more common with these freelancers (although still relatively rare). HIV and AIDS awareness is better than it used to be, but infection statistics among entertainment industry workers remain high; freelancers are the highest risk group. Almost all sex workers insist on using condoms.\nWhile walking in go-go bar areas is generally safe, you have to be cautious of touts who try to drag you into the upstairs bars with offers of ping-pong shows and 100-baht beer. The beer may well be 100 baht, but the \"show\" you'll be treated to will be 1,000 baht or more. The rule of thumb is that if you cannot see inside from street level, avoid the establishment.\n\n\n=== Animal abuse ===\nElephants are a large part of Thailand's tourist business, and the smuggling and mistreatment of elephants for tourist attractions is a widespread practice. Be aware that elephants are often separated from their mothers at a young age to be cruelly trained under captivity for the rest of their lives. Animal charities advise that elephant-friendly tourists should avoid visiting venues offering elephant rides.\nA depressingly common sight on the congested streets of Bangkok is elephant begging. During night hours, mahouts (trainers) with lumbering elephants approach tourists to feed the creatures bananas or take a photo with them for a fee. The elephants are brought to the city to beg in this way because they are out of work and are mistreated and visibly distressed under the conditions of the city. Please avoid supporting this cruelty by rejecting the mahouts as they offer you bananas to feed the elephants. This is especially common in Silom and Sukhumvit.\nDue to its location, lax laws, and resources, many illegal animal products come through Bangkok. Rare and endangered species are often sold at markets for pets, especially at Chatuchak, and many other animal products are sold as luxury items. Avoid buying rare pets, leather, ivory, talons, dried sea creatures (such as starfish), fur, feathers, teeth, wool, and other products since they are most likely the result of illegal poaching, and buying them contributes greatly to animal endangerment and abuse. You could also be arrested and charged under your country's law for trafficking endangered species.\n\n\n=== Political unrest ===\nThai politics are a rough sport and when tensions boil over, protests in Bangkok inevitably ensue and can turn violent. While tourists are rarely if ever targeted, in 2008 one faction managed to close down both of Bangkok's airports for a week, wrecking many travel plans.\nThe latest round of tension kicked off in 2020 when the reformist Future Forward Party was banned, sparking mass protests by young protesters opposed to the military junta and, even more controversially, the Thai monarchy itself. Hundreds were arrested and many charged with crimes including sedition and l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9, with one protester handed a sentence of 87 years in jail. While the COVID situation put a damper on the protests, the underlying tensions are far from resolved. Follow the independent press for the newest political developments and stay away from demonstrations.\n\n\n=== Food and water ===\nAs elsewhere in Thailand, be careful with what you eat. Outside of major tourist hotels and resorts, stay away from raw leafy vegetables, egg-based dressings like mayonnaise, unpackaged ice cream and minced meat as hot weather tends to make food go bad faster. In short, stick to boiled, baked, fried or peeled food.\nTap water in Bangkok is said to be safe when it comes out the plant, but unfortunately the plumbing along the way often is not, so do not drink it. Any water served to you in good restaurants will at least be boiled, but it's best to stick to bottled water, which is ubiquitous and cheap.\nTake care with ice, which may be made with tap water of questionable potability as above. The ice with round holes is made by commercial ice makers who purify their water. However, restaurants or stalls which buy a big block of ice and chip bits off of it for your drink may be suspect. While the big ice blocks are also commercially made from purified water, the staff may not be handling it hygenically.\nThe cheapest way to get drinking water is from streetside reverse osmosis water vending machines. You can fill your own bottles for only a few baht.\n\n\n== Connect ==\n\n\n=== Internet ===\nDue to the surge of mobile connectivity, Internet caf\u00e9s are not common as they used to be. If you look carefully, you may find them in tourist districts such as Khao San Road for around 30-60 baht per hour.\nMany caf\u00e9s and pubs do offer free Wi-Fi to their customers, including the ubiquitous Coffee World chain in all of its branches; ask staff for the password. TrueMove offers both free and paid Wi-Fi access. If you want to get online for free, you must register first, and both session and time is limited. Their network is accessible in many malls, including Siam Square, and sometimes can be available from your room if you stay in a nearby hot-spot \u2014 just look for the 'truewifi' network, you can register. Most hotels and guest houses provide free Wi-Fi.\nThere is not a lot of free Wi-Fi available in old districts like Rattanakosin or Yaowarat. Even at McDonald's and Starbucks, Wi-Fi is not free or not available at all.\nIf you are staying for more than a couple of days and prefer to stay connected without being limited to hotspots, a prepaid SIM card with mobile data is a good option. Being able to use a smartphone for navigation and reviews is very useful in a city where recommendations and directions offered by locals are not always reliable. See the Telephone section for details.\n\n\n=== Telephone ===\nThe area code for Bangkok is 02. You only need to dial the 0 if you're calling from within Thailand. Pay phones are not commonplace, as most Thais have a mobile phone. If you want to avoid high roaming costs, you can buy a local SIM card for 100 baht at Suvarnabhumi Airport or mobile phone shops throughout the city. The 100 baht is not just for the SIM card, but is immediately your first pre-paid amount. Topping it up is easy, such as at 7-Eleven convenience stores. Making international calls is also cheaper this way.\nAs of July 2014, the True booth at Suvarnabhumi Airport is offering free tourist Sim cards preloaded with 10 baht calling credit as well as 20 MB of 3G access.\n\n\n=== Post ===\n\nBangkok's red post boxes are found all over the city. There are also plenty of Thailand Post offices around for sending post and packages. In tourist areas, there are post offices in the Khao San Road area (in front of Wat Bowonniwet) and at Sukhumvit Road (between Soi 4 and 6).\nIf you're staying in Bangkok for a longer time, you might want to make use of poste restante, so other people can send you letters or parcels using a post office's address. Post offices keep the letters for at least two months. Letters sent via poste restante must have the receiver's name on it, with the family name in underlined capital letters. If you want to pick them up near Khao San Road (opposite Wat Bowonniwet), it must be addressed to Poste Restante, Banglamphubon Post Office, Bangkok, 10203, Thailand. If you want to pick up your post in the Sukhumvit area, address it to Poste Restante, Nana Post Office, Sukhumvit Road, Bangkok, 10112, Thailand.\n\n\n== Cope ==\n\n\n=== Publications ===\n Bangkok Post. One of the better English-language newspapers of the country, but also includes sections on travel, leisure, entertainment, life and classifieds in Bangkok. \n BK Magazine. Bangkok's premier city living magazine; a guide to the city's restaurants, nightlife, travel, arts and more. New additions release weekly and are distributed in selected venues. \n Sukhumvit Guide. A complete listing guide to the hotels, restaurants and bars of Sukhumvit, one of Bangkok's most vibrant districts. \n\n\n=== Medical care ===\nMany people go to Bangkok to undergo medical treatments that are a fraction of the cost charged in their home countries. While public hospitals can be understaffed and overcrowded with long wait times, private hospitals are among the best in the world. The best-regarded, and most expensive (though still affordable by Western standards), is Bumrungrad International Hospital, which attracts about 400,000 foreign patients per year or an average of 1,000+ a day. There are also other hospitals, such as Samitivej, Bangkok Hospital and BNH Hospital, that specialize in serving foreigners. Private hospitals in Thailand are accredited by the government according to international standards, and many of the doctors in Thailand hold international accreditation and relevant licences. Staff in private hospitals are generally able to speak English well, and sometimes other foreign languages as well.\nPopular treatments, ranging from cosmetic, organ transplants and orthopedic treatments to dental and cardiac surgeries, are available much cheaper than in the West. For example, Bumrungrad Hospital charges 90,000 baht for an all-inclusive breast implant package. Bangkok is also known as a centre for sexual reassignment surgery for people wishing to change their physical sex, although this falls out of the scope of a casual trip.\nThere are many dental clinics with English-speaking dentists and staff. The largest of them is the Bangkok International Dental Center along Ratchadaphisek Road. There are also plenty of well known teeth whitening, implant and orthodontic providers like BFC Dental, Smile Seasons Dental Clinic, Denta Joy, smile and co dental clinic, Cosdent by SLC, SmileDC , HeySmile Dental Funkudsmile and sivalee dental Clinic\n\n\n=== Immigration office ===\n1 Immigration Bureau, Government Bldg B, Chaeng Wattana Soi 7, \u260f +66 2 141-9889. M-F 08:30-noon, 13:00-16:30. Visas, re-entry permits and many other immigration services are available. The Visa On Arrival can be extended on a simple procedure. The modern big Government Building in Lak Si host the Immigration Division. Official name? \"Government Complex Commemorating His Majesty The King's Eighty Birthday Anniversary, 5 December, BE 2550 (2007)\" But let's just call it: \"Chaeng Watthana Government Complex\" Bus 66 and 166 enter the compounds and stop at the main door (Gate 1) It's a two Km from Lak Si train station (northern and northeaster line) which is the next one after Don Mueang Airport. The Immigration Bureau is on the big B building, it's next to the gate 2 (the southern one) \nThey will request a passport picture (facilities there, 4 pics for 100 baht) and copy of your passport (including the page where the stamp is) 4 baht per both copies. After filling the form a number will be given. If you're not an early bird, the lunch break will catch you, and you will need to wait for that hour, when everybody goes to eat on the big food courts (from 13:00 to 14:00) Supermarkets available. With the number given, and 1900 baht the new stamp will be added to your passport, with extra 30 days after the days your visa finish. The building also host many other offices, like the Consumer Protection Board, Election Commission, the Office of Justice Affairs, among many others. Worth the forced visit. Services for Burmese, Cambodian and Lao citizens remain at the central old location at Soi Suan Plu.\n\n\n=== Embassies ===\n\n\n== Go next ==\n\n\n=== Central Thailand ===\nIf you want to get out of the city for a while, there are plenty of day trip options from Bangkok.\n\nAmphawa \u2014 interesting floating market popular with the locals\nAyutthaya \u2014 ancient capital showcasing its many ruins, 1.5 hr away by bus or train\nBang Pa-In \u2014 its magnificent Summer Palace makes for a pleasant day trip\nDamnoen Saduak \u2014 picture-perfect floating market on tourist steroids\nHua Hin \u2014 beach resort town with nearby waterfalls and national parks\nKanchanaburi \u2014 the famous Bridge over the River Kwai, the Erawan Falls and Hellfire Pass\nKo Kret \u2014 rustic island to the north of Bangkok renowned for pottery making, a pleasant day trip out of the concrete jungle\nNakhon Pathom \u2014 Thailand's oldest city and site of the world's largest stupa\nPhetchaburi \u2014 relaxed historic town with the Khao Wang mountain, colourful temples and delicious desserts\n\n\n=== Further destinations ===\nBangkok is also an excellent hub for onward travel into other regions of Thailand.\n\nChiang Mai \u2014 the gateway to the north and the heart of Lanna culture\nKhao Yai National Park \u2014 stunning mountainous scenery and some of Thailand's fledgling vineyards\nKo Chang \u2014 large relatively unspoiled tropical island\nKo Samet \u2014 the closest beach island to Bangkok with white sand beaches\nKrabi Province \u2014 the beautiful beaches and islands of Ao Nang, Rai Leh, Ko Phi Phi and Ko Lanta\nNakhon Ratchasima (Khorat) \u2014 main city in the Isaan region\nPhuket \u2014 the original Thai paradise island, now very developed but still with some beautiful beaches\nSukhothai \u2014 the ruins of the ancient Sukhothai Kingdom\nSurat Thani \u2014 gateway to Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao\nIf you are considering leaving Thailand there are overland routes to the following destinations:\n\nSiem Reap \u2014 near the Angkor temples.\nPhnom Penh \u2014 capital of Cambodia\nVientiane \u2014 capital of Laos\nHo Chi Minh City \u2014 largest city in Vietnam, another foodie's paradise, some distance away but often the end point of a journey that includes Siem Reap and Phnom Penh in Cambodia; see Bangkok to Ho Chi Minh City overland."

        "title": "Vancouver",
        "extract": "Vancouver occupies an enviable spot in the world.  Blessed with miles of coastline, lush vegetation and crowned by the North Shore Mountains, it's hard to be there and not stop at some point and be amazed by what you see.\nBut scratch beneath that setting and you find a cosmopolitan city of many faces. It is a mix of old and new, a stopping place for immigrants that have infused the city's neighbourhoods, festivals and food. On one hand, Greater Vancouver is the third largest metropolitan area in Canada, the second biggest destination for visitors to the country and the economic hub of British Columbia. A modern city of glass towers with a variety of festivals, cultures and attractions, it has also been host to world events like the 1986 World Exposition and the 2010 Winter Olympics. To others, it's Vansterdam, the laid-back socially progressive city with the laissez-faire attitude to marijuana. With its Asian heritage and relative proximity to China and Japan, some see it as the gateway to Asia; often called Hongcouver due to the large number of immigrants and political refugees from Hong Kong living in the area. And with all that nature minutes from your door, Vancouver is a haven for outdoor enthusiasts.  It's one of those rare places you could ski in the mountains, hit one of the many sandy beaches and play a round of golf all in the same day. Vancouver is one of the most culturally diverse and cosmopolitan cities in the world, with just under half its residents born outside Canada.\nAll of this makes it easy to be a local. Walk the Seawall. Spend a day in one of the parks. Indulge in food and treats from around the world at a neighbourhood restaurant. Or just grab a spot at the beach or on a patio and watch it all go by \u2013 Vancouver is, after all, one of the most beautiful spots in the world.\n\n\n== Districts ==\nVancouverites broadly split the City of Vancouver in three: the Westside, the Eastside (or East Van) and city centre. This split is simply geography: everything west of Ontario St is the Westside, everything east is East Vancouver and everything north of False Creek is the city centre. Each of these areas have their own attractions and neighbourhoods, so time permitting, explore as many as you can. This list covers only the City of Vancouver. For the rest of Greater Vancouver, see Lower Mainland.\n\n\n=== City Centre ===\n\n\n=== Outside the city centre ===\n\n\n== Understand ==\nWhile Vancouver is a comparatively young city, founded in 1867, its history begins long before. The Coast Salish indigenous peoples (First Nations) have lived in the area for at least 6,000 years. The present city's namesake Captain George Vancouver sailed through the First Narrows on 13 June 1792, naming Burrard Inlet after his friend Sir Harry Burrard. The first settlement on the downtown peninsula was Granville, on the spot of today's Gastown. In 1867, the year of Canada's confederation, a saloon was built on this site and gave birth to a small shantytown of bars and stores, adjacent to the original mill, on the south shore of what is now the city's harbour. A seemingly endless supply of high-quality lumber was logged and sold through the ports of Gastown and Moodyville, across the inlet.  Some of the trees were gigantic beams which were shipped to China to construct Beijing's Imperial Palace. One account maintains that the world's windjammer fleets could not have been built without the trees of Burrard Inlet.\nVancouver's first City Hall was little more than a hand-painted sign nailed to a wooden tent post. The arrival of the transcontinental railway, a few years later, spurred growth even more, and by 1892 the area had over 20,000 residents. 18 years later, this figure was over 100,000.\nFactor in constant growth every year since (many in the double digits), and Greater Vancouver today is Canada's largest metropolitan area west of Toronto by far, with more than 2,600,000 residents, more than half of British Columbia's population as a whole. It is also the fastest growing part of Canada. During the 1980s and 1990s, Vancouver received a large number of immigrants from Hong Kong fleeing the impending handover to China. Greater Vancouver is today one of the most ethnically diverse metropolitan areas in the world, home to the second largest Chinese population in North America after the San Francisco Bay Area, and with about half its population being born outside Canada. It is also home to a large and influential Sikh community, and one of the main centres of the Khalistan movement that advocates for the carving out of an independent Sikh nation from India.\nFor many, Vancouver truly \"arrived\" in 1986, when the city hosted the Expo 86 World's Fair. Media attention from around the world was consistently positive, though many saw the resulting gentrification of poorer areas as being harmful to Vancouver's lower-class citizens, as many residents of the Downtown Eastside were evicted from their homes. Vancouver also hosted the 2010 Winter Olympics, which was largely seen as another success, though it brought some similar criticisms.\nVancouver is perhaps best known for its scenic beauty, and the opportunities afforded by its natural environment. Vancouver is one of those rare places where you could theoretically ski in the mountains, windsurf in the ocean, and play a round of golf all in the same day. Surrounded by water on three sides, and crowned by the North Shore mountains, Vancouver is a great destination, and a great starting point for discovering the area's many outdoor activities.\nVancouver is a major sea port on the Pacific Ocean, and a base for many Alaska cruise ships in the summer.  It has the same name as another city in the region, Vancouver, Washington (USA).\nVancouver is believed to be the inspiration for the fictional setting of Adventure Bay, in the animated children's television series PAW Patrol.\nVancouver's residents enjoy a high standard of living, and the city is consistently ranked among the most livable on Earth.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nDepending on who you talk to, or perhaps, when, Vancouver's climate is either much maligned or envied.  Late fall and winter are typically damp with clouds smothering the sky like a wet grey blanket (there's a reason Vancouver is sometimes referred to as the \"Wet Coast\").  But there are benefits to all that rain: it's usually not snowing (unlike most of the rest of Canada) and it leads to a gorgeous display of colour with the start of spring in early March. And that's where Vancouver really shines \u2013 the spring and summer. Springs can still be wet, but it gets warmer and the shrubs, blossom trees and flowers put on a pretty show. Summer days are long and usually sunny with little humidity. Summer daylight lasts from 5:15AM to as late as 9:15PM in late June.\nSummer temperatures from mid-June to early-Sept are mostly comfortable. Temperatures peak in late July and early August with an average daytime highs around 23 \u00b0C (73 \u00b0F) and overnight lows around 15 \u00b0C (59 \u00b0F). Some particularly hot days can see temperatures climb upwards to 26 \u00b0C (79 \u00b0F) and not go below 17 \u00b0C (63 \u00b0F) at night. Daytime summer highs increase the further east you go, with eastern areas of the city having average daytime highs around 25.6 \u00b0C (78.1 \u00b0F), climbing around to or even exceeding 31 \u00b0C (88 \u00b0F) on exceptionally hot days. \nSpring and fall are cooler and wetter, so packing a mix of cool and warm weather clothing is recommended. If visiting Vancouver between November and March, be prepared for wet weather and cool temperatures. Daytime highs are typically around 5-8\u00b0C (40-50\u00b0F) while overnight lows will get close to 0\u00b0C (32\u00b0F) and sometimes colder. December and January are the coldest months, with the most rain and a chance of snow. While Vancouver's winters are not as harsh as those in other major Canadian cities, the city does get a few days of snow in the winter months every year. Sunrises in winter are after 8AM, with darkness setting in prior to 4:15PM in December.\n\n\n=== Visitor information ===\n1 Tourism Vancouver Visitor Centre, 200 Burrard St (Plaza level, Burrard & Cordova), \u260f +1 604-683-2000, fax: +1 604-682-6839. 8:30AM-6PM.

The Domestic and International Terminal is the main terminal that most travellers will use, while the South Terminal has prop, small jet, and seaplane service to local communities in British Columbia and Yukon.   \nYVR is the second busiest airport in Canada, with frequent flights from cities in British Columbia, the rest of Canada, other North American countries, Asia, and Europe. It is also the only Canadian airport to have direct flights to Australia and New Zealand because of its westerly location.\n\nTransLink's SkyTrain (Canada Line) provides direct service to downtown Vancouver in 25 minutes. The fare from YVR to Vancouver is $9.65 (July 2024), which includes the two-zone base fare of $4.65 plus a $5 surcharge (the \"YVR AddFare\") incurred only for departures from the airport. Bus N10 runs overnight to Vancouver when the Skytrain service is closed. Route C92 connects the South Terminal with Bridgeport station on the Canada Line during limited daytime hours. \nThe typical travel time from the airport to downtown by taxi is 20-30 minutes. Fares for a taxi ride from the airport to Vancouver or Richmond are fixed and vary depending on the zone of the destination. The zone map and fixed rates are posted at YVR Taxis. Metered fares apply for all trips going to the airport, and for trips from outside the zones. All taxis that serve the airport are required to accept credit cards.\n\n\n==== Seaplane ====\nThere are floatplane facilities about 300 metres south of YVR's South Terminal and in downtown Vancouver at:\n\n2 Vancouver Harbour Flight Centre (CXH  IATA), 1055 Canada Place (Downtown Vancouver), \u260f +1 604-647-7570.   \nThese floatplane facilities offer frequent flights to downtown Vancouver and/or YVR.

Some float plane operators also offer spectacular tours of the central city and nearby attractions starting at about $80-100 per person. A great way to see a panoramic view of downtown. A quick search of Google will bring up websites for most of these float plane operators. See Vancouver International Airport for seaplane flights that land at that airport.\nSeaplane airlines operating to downtown Vancouver:\n\n Harbour Air, \u260f +1-604-274-1277, toll-free: +1-800-665-0212.

This road skirts the eastern edge of Vancouver, so if you want to get into the city, you will need to exit off it at Grandview Highway (exit 28A), 1st Avenue (exit 27) or Hastings Street (exit 26). Most major highways from interior British Columbia converge at Hope, 143 km (89 mi) east of Vancouver, then following the Trans-Canada Highway west into Vancouver.\nFrom the U.S./Canada border south of the city, Highway 99, which links up with U.S. Interstate 5, runs north to Vancouver.  The freeway ends after the Oak Street Bridge, turning into Oak Street heading north. Drivers with a downtown destination will need to get onto Granville Street (parallel to Oak St to the west), or Cambie Street (parallel to the east), in order to get on the Granville Street or Cambie Street bridges which cross False Creek into the downtown peninsula.\nIf you are coming from the North Shore or other points further north, the only way into Vancouver is by bridge. Your options are the Lions Gate Bridge (Hwy 99) which brings you into Stanley Park and Vancouver's West End or the Second Narrows Bridge/Ironworkers Memorial Bridge (Hwy 1) which brings you into the neighbourhoods of East Van.\n\n\n=== By bus ===\nMany bus services reach the Vancouver area, most of which terminate at Pacific Central Station (see \"By train\" below for the location and directions).

As a result, development has taken a different course than in most other major North American cities resulting in a relatively high use of transit and cycling, a dense, walkable core and a development model that is studied and emulated elsewhere.\n\n\n=== By public transit ===\n TransLink, \u260f +1-604-953-3333.

TransLink does not have a mobile app, but Google Maps, Transit and Citymapper all have access to TransLink's GPS data to show current route information and estimated arrival times.\n\n\n==== Fares and zones ====\n\nTransLink breaks Metro Vancouver into three fare zones; your fare depends on the number of zones you travel in. The standard adult fare is $3.20 for all bus trips across Metro Vancouver and SkyTrain travel within the City of Vancouver (Zone 1). It also covers all travel system-wide at off-peak times: weekends, holidays, and weekday evenings after 6:30PM. Travel out of Vancouver on the SkyTrain or SeaBus crosses fare zone boundaries and costs $4.65 to $6.35 on weekdays before 6:30PM.\nAfter paying fare, you can transfer or re-board an unlimited number of times at no extra charge for 90 minutes. Compass Card and Compass Ticket users have no restrictions on transferring between modes of transit, but bus riders paying cash fare can only transfer to other buses.\nUpon final tap-in within the 90-minute window, Compass Card and Compass Ticket users have an additional 120 minutes to tap out at their final destination. Tapping out after this time will result in another fare being charged.\n\nFares paid using Compass Card (see next section) are discounted and cost between $2.60 and $4.90 for an adult fare.\nConcession fares are available for youth (13-18) and seniors (65+), with ID. Children age 12 or younger are free.\n\n\n==== Paying for your fare: Compass ====\n\nCompass is the electronic fare system for buses, SkyTrain, SeaBus and the West Coast Express. Buses still accept cash when you board, but fare gates at SkyTrain and SeaBus station only accept Compass. There are two Compass choices:\n\nCompass Ticket \u2014 A white ticket that is good for one trip. The DayPass \u2013 unlimited travel on bus, SkyTrain and SeaBus across all zones for one day \u2013 can also be purchased as a Compass Ticket; and\nCompass Card \u2014 A reusable smart card that can store value, load passes and offers discounted fares. Blue cards are for adult fares, orange cards are for concession fares. See the infobox for more information.\nCompass Tickets and Adult Compass Cards can be purchased from the Compass Vending Machines in SkyTrain and SeaBus stations and some London Drugs locations. All types of cards and tickets may be purchased over the counter at some 7-Eleven, Safeway, London Drugs, Shoppers Drug Mart locations, and the TransLink Customer Service Centre at Waterfront station. TransLink's website has a handy map showing the locations of Compass retailers and Compass Vending Machines. The vending machines accept cash, Interac debit cards, and Visa or MasterCard credit card. American Express can only be used to buy a card or ticket from a retail location.\nThe purchase of a Compass Card requires a $6 deposit. The deposit is refundable if you return your Compass Card to or mail a Refund Request form to the Compass Customer Service Centre, but if your remaining cash balance is above $20, the only way to get back the balance is to have a cheque mailed out, so make sure to use up your balance before you do so.\nTap in with your Compass Card or Ticket at the start of every trip on any vehicle, and tap out every time you exit through a fare gate. Bus riders do not tap out. Doing this lets the system calculate the right fare.\nIf you're travelling in a group, Compass Tickets and Cards cannot be shared between group members. Each person will need their own ticket or card to tap in and out of the fare gates.\nMastercard and Visa credit cards can also be used at Compass readers/fare gates for an adult fare. When you tap-in, your card will be pre-authorized for a three zone fare. When you tap-out, the fare will be calculated according to the zones travelled. Mobile wallets (such as Apple Pay and Google Pay) also work, just make sure your phone will have enough battery so you can tap-out at the end of your journey. Debit cards still work at Compass vending machines, but not at Compass readers.\nFind out how to pay fares and where to buy passes and TransLink's refund policy.\n\n\n==== Passes and stored value ====\nIf you are going to make heavy use of the transit system, passes can be loaded onto a Compass Card.\n\nA DayPass is a money-saving option for travellers who will use public transit heavily for one day. For $11.50 (or $9.05 concession) (July 2024), it offers unlimited travel across Metro Vancouver on bus, SkyTrain and SeaBus until the end of the service day, late at night.\nMonthly passes can save you money if you will be using transit almost daily for a month. They cost between $107.30 and $193.80 (or $61.35 concession) depending on the number of zones.\n\n\n==== Buses ====\n\nThe bus service covers the widest area and travels along most major streets in the city. Many of the routes within the City of Vancouver are electric trolley buses, powered by overhead wires.  \nA limited stop express bus line called the RapidBus serves, not only Vancouver, but the entire lower mainland (Metro Vancouver) RapidBus gets a priority lane in traffic, There are 6 different RapidBus Routes. When boarding the RapidBus, It's all door-boarding, and passengers must either tap in with their Compass Card or Compass Ticket, buy a ticket with cash, (exact change required, coins only), or present a ticket to the driver. To buy a ticket with cash, passengers must enter through the front door. The 6 RapidBus Routes are:\n\nR1 King George Blvd (operates in Surrey)\nR2 Marine Drive (operates in North Vancouver and West Vancouver)\nR3 Lougheed Highway (operates in Coquitlam, Port Coquitlam, Pitt Meadows, Maple Ridge)\nR4 41st Ave (operates in Vancouver's UBC and South Vancouver areas)\nR5 Hastings Street (operates in Vancouver's central business district, Gastown-Chinatown and East Van, and in Burnaby)\nR6 Scott Road (operates in Surrey)\nSimilar to RapidBus, is the 99 B-Line, which is a limited stop express bus route that travels along Broadway Avenue (operates in Vancouver's UBC, Kitsilano, Mt Pleasant, and East Van). The portion of this route east of Arbutus St is to be replaced by an extension of the Millennium Line opening in 2027.   \nCash fare on any bus to anywhere at any time is a flat $3.20. Because of this, Compass Card users only tap in when boarding the bus, and never tap out when stepping off, unlike with all other modes of transit.\nEvery bus stop in Metro Vancouver has a unique five-digit bus stop number (the yellow number at the top of the bus stop sign). Send an SMS with that stop number to 33333 to get the next six scheduled bus arrival times. Standard text messaging rates apply. TransLink does not operate an app, but many third party apps (such as Google Maps) can be used to get transit times, additionally a mobile website is available. Many popular bus stops include a digital display with estimated bus arrival times. The stops for the RapidBus, have an electronic, real time, bus schedule.\n\n\n==== SkyTrain ====\nThe SkyTrain is a mostly elevated, fully automated rapid transit system connecting downtown Vancouver with some of its suburbs to the south and east. Trains depart frequently throughout the day, on tracks separated from other traffic at up to 80 km/h.\nThe Expo Line runs from Waterfront Station in downtown Vancouver through Burnaby and New Westminster to Columbia Station, where it splits with some trips going to King George Station in Surrey and the other track going to University/Production Way station in Burnaby.  An eastern extension to Langley is expected to open in 2029.\nThe Millennium Line runs east-west from VCC-Clark in East Van through northern Burnaby to Lougheed Station, and then continues on to Port Moody and Coquitlam via the Evergreen Extension.  A western extension along Broadway to Arbutus St is expected to open in 2027.\nThe Canada Line runs from Waterfront Station in downtown Vancouver south to Bridgeport Station, where it splits with some trips to Richmond's city centre and some trips to Vancouver International Airport's domestic and international terminals.\nKey SkyTrain stations include:\n\nCommercial-Broadway \u2013 accesses restaurants and shopping on Commercial Drive in East Vancouver and transfer point to the 99 B-Line bus to UBC.  Meeting point for the Expo Line and Millennium Line.\nBurrard and Granville \u2013 the most central stations in the central business district. You can also connect to the R5 Hastings Street RapidBus route at Burrard station.\nWaterfront \u2013 meeting point for Expo Line and Canada Line, the SeaBus, numerous commuter and rapid bus routes, and the commuter rail West Coast Express. It also accesses Gastown and is right next to the Canada Place Convention Centre/Cruise Ship Terminal facilities.\nThe fare on SkyTrain depends on how many zones you travel through and what time you're travelling. The City of Vancouver is Zone 1. Close-in suburbs like Burnaby, New Westminster, Richmond, and North Vancouver are Zone 2. Farther-out suburbs south of the Fraser River or east of Burnaby are Zone 3. At peak times, Compass Card users pay between $2.60 and $4.90, and riders paying cash fare pay $3.20 to $6.35 (all fares are standard adult fare). At off-peak times, passengers pay the one-zone.\nCompass Card users tap in and out each time they pass through the fare gates. If you forget to tap in or out, you will be charged the maximum fare. People choosing not to use Compass Cards can buy single-use Compass Tickets instead.\n\n\n==== SeaBus ====\nThe SeaBus is a passenger ferry that connects Waterfront Station downtown to Lonsdale Quay in North Vancouver. It generally runs every 15 minutes until the 9:16PM departure, after which it runs every 30 minutes until last sailing (M-Sa 1:22AM, Su 11:16PM).\nDuring peak times, two-zone fare is required. That is $3.85 for passengers with Compass Cards and $4.65 (July 2024) for those with Compass Tickets. At off-peak times, passengers pay one-zone fare.\n\n\n=== By ferry ===\nPrivate operators have scheduled ferry service to destinations around False Creek. A quick trip across on a cute little-boat-that-could ferry can be the most fun, traffic-free, and convenient way to get around between the following destinations (from west to east):\n\nMaritime Museum in Vanier Park on the south shore in Kitsilano (False Creek Ferries)\nAquatic Centre at Sunset Beach on the north shore in the West End (False Creek Ferries)\nHornby St on the north shore in the city centre (Aquabus)\nGranville Island and its famous Public Market on the south shore (Aquabus / False Creek Ferries at different docks)\nYaletown/Davie St. on the north shore (Aquabus / False Creek Ferries)\nStamp's Landing/Monk's and Spyglass Place on the south shore in the False Creek area (Aquabus / False Creek Ferries)\nPlaza of Nations and Edgewater Casino on the north shore in Yaletown (Aquabus / False Creek Ferries)\nScience World, the geodesic dome at the south-east end of False Creek (Aquabus / False Creek Ferries)\nService is offered by:\n\n False Creek Ferries, \u260f +1 604-684-7781. Little blue boats.   (updated Jun 2023)\n Aquabus, \u260f +1 604-689-5858. Little rainbow boats.   (updated Jun 2023)\nThe two ferries run slightly different routes, and their docks on Granville Island are on either side of the Public Market. As of Jan 2017, prices for adults are $3.25 for short routes, $5.50 for long routes, or $15 for a day pass. For seniors and children, the prices are $2, $3.75, and $11-13. Aquabus offers a 25-minute \"mini-cruise\" around False Creek for $8 per adult and $4 per child or senior.\n\n\n=== By car ===\nVancouver's road network is generally a grid system with a \"Street\" running north-south and an \"Avenue\" running east-west. Arterial roads follow the grid fairly well (although not perfectly), but side streets frequently disappear for blocks at a time and then reappear. Most of the \"Avenues\" are numbered and they always use East or West to designate whether it is on the east side or the west side of Ontario Street. Some of the major avenues use names rather than numbers (Broadway would be 9th Ave, King Edward Ave would be 25th Ave).\nDowntown Vancouver has its own grid system and doesn't follow the street/avenue format of the rest of the city. It is also surrounded by water on three sides, so most of the ways in and out require you to cross a bridge. This can cause traffic congestion, particularly at peak times (morning and evening commutes, sunny weekend afternoons, major sporting events), so factor that into any driving plans, or avoid if possible.\n\nOne of the best ways to avoid traffic congestion is to listen to traffic reports on AM730. This station reports only about traffic and can be quick to report any accidents and congestion, as well as B.C. ferry reports, bridge and tunnel updates, border wait times, and other information pertaining to getting around the city and its many suburbs. It also posts frequent weather updates and local news.\nA unique feature of Vancouver and the rest of British Columbia is intersections with flashing green traffic signals.  These do not indicate an advance left turn as it would in many other parts of North America.  Instead, a flashing green light indicates a traffic signal that can be activated only by a pedestrian or a cyclist on the side street, but not by a motor vehicle.  When the signal turns red, traffic stops as at any traffic signal.  Any side street traffic must obey the stop sign on the side street and must yield to any pedestrians crossing the side street, even if traffic is stopped on the main street.\n\n\n==== Parking ====\n\nParking downtown generally costs $1-2.50/hour or $12-20/day. Commercial areas will typically have meter parking on the street, with meters accepting Canadian and American change only (American coins accepted at par value). Residential streets may allow free parking, but some will require a permit.\nIf you do not have cash with you, most meters allow you to text the lot and stall number to PayByPhone, allowing payment through Visa or Mastercard. Each meter will specify if available.\nEasy Park lots (look for an orange circle with a big \"P\") rank as the most affordable of the parkades, but generally the cost of parking will not vary greatly among parkades within a certain area.  Most will accept payment by credit card, as well as coins.  Beware of scammers hanging around in some parkades, trying to sell parking tickets for less than their face value \u2014 typically, they have purchased the tickets with stolen credit cards. Also be careful parking overnight, as vehicle break-ins are not uncommon.\nCity meters and parking regulations are enforced regularly. Meter-related offenses will result in fines. Violations in private lots are generally unenforceable, but may result in your car being towed. If your vehicle is towed on a city street, you can recover it at the city impound lot at 425 Industrial Ave.\nSome new meters at private parking lots throughout the city no longer accept cash, make sure to also have a credit card with you. Most parking facilities also accept payment using the PayByPhone app.\n\n\n==== Car sharing ====\nVancouver is often referred to as the car share capital, with over 2,000 available vehicles. Car sharing which allow vehicle rentals by the hour and minute. With the departure of Car2Go and Zipcar, the only companies left in this space are Evo and Modo. If you are a BCAA member, you can get a free Evo membership through their website. To sign up for Modo, if your licence was issued from outside BC, you will need to put down a $750 damage deposit or provide a copy of your driving records from your home country (including a translation to English made by an approved translator if it is not already in English.)\n\n\n=== By taxi ===\n Black Top Cabs, \u260f +1 604-731-1111.

(updated Jul 2022)\n\n\n=== By bicycle ===\n\nVancouver is a very bicycle-friendly city. In addition to the extremely popular seawall bicycle routes along Stanley Park, False Creek and Kitsilano, there is a network of bicycle routes that connect the whole city, with many of the downtown bike lanes separated from traffic. The City of Vancouver provides a map of the bicycle routes that is available at most bike shops or online.  Also, all buses have bicycle racks on the front to help riders get to less accessible parts. North American visitors will find that drivers in Vancouver are more accustomed to sharing the road with cyclists than many places.\nThe city of Vancouver operates a bike share program called Mobi. A 24-hour pass costs $19 for an unlimited number of 30-minute trips, with each additional minute costing 25 cents. Monthly passes are available for $39 (30-minute trips). Trips on a monthly pass that take longer than the allowed time will be charged an extra 25 cents per minute. Bike stations are spread across downtown, the West End, Gastown, Yaletown and False Creek, Granville Island and Kitsilano. Bikes are unlocked via a user code and PIN that are provided after you complete registration on Mobi's website. It's highly recommended that visitors complete registration before their visit, as you cannot do it at bike share stations.\nLonger term bike rentals are available at a number of independent shops, where you can rent bicycles by the hour, day or week. Many places also rent tandem bikes. Shops can be found in the  central business district, the West End, Yaletown and near Granville Island. Alternatively, buy a used bicycle and either sell it on or donate it to someone in more need of it at the end of your stay.\n\n\n=== By scooter ===\nRenting a scooter is a good compromise between a bike and a car. Scooters are not allowed on the famous bike path, but it is possible to travel in the inner roads, park and walk at all the attractions.\nAverage cost is ~$80 for 24 hours + gas.\n\n Cycle BC, Location 1: (next to harbour air terminal) Location 2: 73 East 6th Ave, \u260f +1 604-709-5663. \nVanEcoRide Escooter & Ebike Rental 1020 Mainland St unit 26 +1 778-683-7711\n Vancouver Scooter Rental, 501-2050 Scotia St, \u260f +1 604-787-9177. \n\n\n== See ==\nWhile Vancouver is still a young city, it has a variety of attractions and points of interest for the visitor.\n\n\n=== Landmarks and historic buildings ===\nMany of the city's landmarks and historical buildings can be found in the central business district. Canada Place, with its distinctive sails, the nearby Olympic Cauldron, the intricate Art Deco styling of the Marine Building and the old luxury railway hotel of the Hotel Vancouver are in the central business district. Stanley Park (the city's most popular attraction), along with its neighbouring Coal Harbour walkway and the Vancouver Aquarium are in the West End.  Gastown, the original town site of Vancouver, has a number of restored buildings and its steam clock is a popular spot to visit. Modern architecture worth visiting also includes Shangri-La, the tallest building in the city, and the Sheraton Wall Centre, both located in central business district. Another popular city landmark, the bustling markets and shops of Granville Island, is just to the south of downtown in an area called South Granville.\n\n\n=== Museums and galleries ===\nIf you're looking to learn about the people of the Northwest Coast and some of its history, one good spot is the impressive Museum of Anthropology at the University of British Columbia, which houses several thousand objects from BC's First Nations. The museum is also home to significant collections of archaeological objects and ethnographic materials from other parts of the world.\nThe Vancouver Art Gallery in the central business district combines local with international through a variety of exhibitions and a permanent collection that focuses on renowned British Columbia artist, Emily Carr.\n\nThe Central Library location of the Vancouver Public Library, in the central business district at Homer and Robson Streets, is modelled after the Roman Colosseum, and houses the city's largest library.\nAnother sight in the  central business district is the small Contemporary Art Gallery on Nelson Street, which features modern art. Also nearby, on the east side of False Creek is the shiny geodesic dome of the Telus World of Science (commonly known as Science World), which has a number of exhibits, shows and galleries aimed at making science fun for kids.\nAnother great spot to check out is the BC Sports Hall of Fame and Museum at Gate A of BC Place Stadium in Yaletown. The BC Sports Hall of Fame and Museum preserves and honours BC's Sport heritage by recognizing extraordinary achievement in sport through using their collection and stories to inspire all people to pursue their dreams.\nThere are also some smaller sights in Kitsilano, including the Vancouver Maritime Museum, Museum of Vancouver, and H.R. Macmillan Space Centre.\n\n\n=== Parks ===\nThe city has a wealth of parks and gardens scattered throughout.  The most famous is Stanley Park at the tip of the West End. Its miles of trails for walking and cycling, beaches, magnificent views and the attractions (including totem poles) within the park gives it something for everyone.  The most popular trail is the Seawall, a paved trail that runs around the perimeter of Stanley Park and now joins with the seawalls in Coal Harbour and Kitsilano, 22 km in length. The Vancouver Aquarium is in Stanley Park. Other notable parks and gardens include VanDusen Botanical Garden in South Vancouver and Queen Elizabeth Park near South Main, the Nitobe Memorial Garden (commonly known as the Nitobe Japanese Garden) and UBC Botanical Garden at the University of British Columbia and the Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden in Chinatown.\nAdmission to Vancouver's various attractions can range from $10 to up to $30 per person. There are a variety of attractions passes available that help visitors save on retail admissions such as the See Vancouver Smartvisit Card.\n\n\n=== Nature ===\nFinally, a trip to Vancouver wouldn't be complete without a glimpse of the skyline and the Coast Mountains rising above the city (clouds permitting, of course!). Popular spots to view it include Stanley Park in the West End, Harbour Centre in the central business district, Spanish Banks and Jericho Beaches in Point Grey, and Lonsdale Quay in North Vancouver. Other interesting views can be seen from City Hall at 12th and Cambie in Mt Pleasant, Queen Elizabeth Park in Mt Pleasant, and East Van's CRAB Park.\n\n\n== Do ==\n\n\n=== Culture and festivals ===\nVancouver isn't all about the outdoors. It offers a variety of theatre, concerts and other cultural events.  There are symphony and opera venues in the central business district and much of the city's live theatre can be found in South Granville, particularly on Granville Island with its thriving arts scene.\nThe city's Chinese heritage comes alive during Chinese New Year.  Chinatown, in the east side of downtown, is awash in colour and has many festivities, including a parade.  June sees the annual Dragon Boat Festival on False Creek.\nThere is no shortage of festivals around the city, with many local ones particular to a neighbourhood.  The festival that draws the largest crowds is the Honda Celebration of Light, a three-night extravaganza of fireworks over English Bay in late July. Countries compete with 20-30 min displays choreographed to music.  The fireworks start at 10PM and are best viewed from Sunset Beach in the West End or Kits Beach/Vanier Park in Kitsilano. It is strongly recommended to take public transit and to get there a few hours early as the crowds are huge. Roads in the vicinity of English Bay are typically closed from 6PM onwards.\nEAT! Vancouver - The Everything Food + Cooking Festival takes place every year. The festival takes place in early November. Celebrity chefs, popular local restaurants, wineries, food & beverage manufacturers, cookbook authors, retailers, artisans, & many others from the culinary world come together for a 6-day event.\nOther notable festivals include the Vancouver International Film Festival that runs in Sept-Oct; the Fringe Festival that presents live theatre in a variety of styles and venues; Bard on the Beach Shakespeare Festival that runs May - September at Vanier Park in Kitsilano; and the three day Folk Fest on the beach in Kitsilano that features a large selection of current and upcoming folk, roots and world music acts. Another notable event is Vancouver's annual Vancouver Pride Parade, in early August, which attractsover 600,000 spectators.\n\n\n=== Laugh ===\nVancouver is also home to an enormous stand-up comedy scene. With 3 dedicated clubs, and more than two dozen venues hosting regular events, the Lower Mainland plays host to nearly 10,000 improv, stand-up, and open mic shows a year, such as by the Improv Centre on Granville Island. Catch touring comics, well-seasoned locals, or up and coming newbies at shows from theaters to pizza joints and experience some of the local, underground culture.\n\n\n=== Live music ===\nVancouver has lots and lots of live music venues ranging from BC Place (over 60,000 seats) to local bars, pubs and coffee shops.  There are also a plethora of festivals especially throughout the summer months.  The Vancouver International Jazz Festival runs for two weeks in late June and early July and attracts big name jazz and avant garde acts.\n\n\n=== Outdoor activities ===\nVancouverites love the outdoors and one of the most popular things to do is to walk, jog, bike or rollerblade the Seawall.  It starts at Canada Place downtown, wraps around Stanley Park and follows the shoreline of False Creek through Yaletown, Science World and Granville Island to Kits Beach in Kitsilano. The most popular sections are around Stanley Park and along the north shore of False Creek. Bike and rollerblade rentals are available from a few shops near the corner of Denman & West Georgia in the West End if you prefer wheeled transportation over walking.  If the weather's nice, go out to Granville Island, rent a speedboat and take a boat ride on the waters around Stanley Park and Coal Harbour. Golf courses are also abundant in the city, along with more cost-conscious pitch-and-putt courses.\nIf you'd rather lie in the sun than play in the sun, Vancouver has a number of beaches. While certainly not glamorous and lacking waves, there's sand, water and lots of people on sunny summer days. Kitsilano has a string of beaches, the most well known being Kitsilano Beach, Jericho and Spanish Banks.  Kits Beach is the most popular and has beach volleyball, Spanish Banks is a bit quieter and popular with skimboarders. There are a few beaches on the south and west sides of downtown, with English Bay Beach (near Denman & Beach in the West End) being the largest and most popular.  Finally, no discussion of Vancouver beaches would be complete without mention of Wreck Beach at the tip of Point Grey in UBC. As much rock as it is sand, it holds a place in the Vancouver identity and is the only city beach where you can bare it all. [2]\nFor many, Vancouver is synonymous with skiing and snowboarding.  While there are no ski hills within the city itself, there are three \"local\" hills (Cypress, Grouse Mountain and Seymour) across the harbour on the North Shore. And of course, Vancouver is the gateway to Whistler, the biggest and one of the most highly rated snow destinations in North America.\n\n\n=== Spectator sports ===\nWhen you tire of doing stuff outdoors, or prefer that someone else do the hard work, you can always grab a seat and take in the local sports teams.\n\n\n==== Hockey ====\nThe biggest draw in town is hockey (the variety played on ice, not a field) and the local professional team is the Vancouver Canucks. The team plays at Rogers Arena in Yaletown and the season lasts from October to April (and possibly longer when they make the play-offs). Tickets are pricey and the concessions are even worse, but it's a good game to watch live. The local junior hockey team, the Vancouver Giants, offer a cheaper but no less exciting experience, but play in the Langley Events Centre some distance from Vancouver.\n\n\n==== Football ====\nThe BC Lions, the city's Canadian Football League team (think American football with 12 players a side, three downs, a slightly larger field, and much larger end zones) plays during the summer and fall at BC Place in Yaletown.\n\n\n==== Soccer ====\nThe Vancouver Whitecaps FC, the third team to bear the \"Whitecaps\" name, began play in Major League Soccer in March 2011, becoming the second MLS team in Canada (they have since been joined by a third Canadian team). They have played at BC Place since September 2011, when that venue reopened after post-Olympics renovations. The Whitecaps initially planned to build a new stadium of their own near the waterfront, but local opposition led the Whitecaps to make BC Place their long-term home.\n\n\n==== Rugby ====\nBC Place also hosts the Canada Sevens, an annual event in the World Rugby Sevens Series (marketed as the HSBC SVNS), a worldwide series of tournaments for men's and women's national teams in rugby sevens, a variant of rugby union featuring 7 players per side instead of 15 (on the same full-size field) and halves of 7 minutes instead of 40. In the current schedule, the event is held on the last weekend of February as part of a North American swing that also includes an event in the Los Angeles suburb of Carson, California.\n\n\n==== Roller derby ====\nThe Terminal City Rollergirls are Vancouver's first female roller derby league and are members of the Women's Flat Track Derby Association. Created in 2006, the league now has four full teams (Faster Pussycats, Bad Reputations, Public Frenemy, and Riot Girls) as well as an All-Stars team made up of the best players in the league. The players are a diverse group of women, from nurses to construction workers, graphic designers, television producers, teachers, stay-at-home moms, PhD students and aspiring rock stars. The bouts are exciting and fun (there is usually an entertaining half-time show). If you're thinking about attending a bout and know nothing or very little about flat track roller derby, check out the Women\u2019s Flat Track Derby Association's (WFTDA) explanation. Bouts are generally held April to September and at various arenas around Metro Vancouver, although the PNE Forum in East Van has been a popular venue.\n\n\n==== Baseball ====\nVancouver has a single A baseball team, the Vancouver Canadians, who play out of Nat Bailey Stadium in the Mt Pleasant area.\n\n\n==== University sports ====\nThe two major universities in the Vancouver area both have comprehensive athletic programs, though not at the high profile of similar institutions south of the border:\n\n Simon Fraser Red Leafs. Represent Simon Fraser University in Burnaby. The Red Leafs sponsor teams in seven men's sports and nine women's sports. Notably, SFU is the only Canadian school that's a member of the U.S. NCAA, though they are in Division II, competing with mostly smaller, regional U.S. institutions. SFU no longer plays football, either American or Canadian; it had played under American rules in the NCAA, but logistical complications led the school to drop the sport after the 2022 season.  (updated Jun 2024)\n UBC Thunderbirds. Represent the University of British Columbia in the University Endowment Lands at the west edge of the Point Grey peninsula. The Thunderbirds field teams in 15 men's sports and 14 women's sports. Unlike SFU, UBC is a member of Canada's governing body for university sport, U Sports.  (updated Aug 2022)\n\n\n=== Tours ===\nIf you want to orient yourself in the city, there are a variety of tours \u2013 bus, walking, hop-on, hop-off \u2013 based out of the City Centre that will regale you with Vancouver lore while taking you to many of the main attractions.\n\n\n== Learn ==\nVancouver is a city with a rich assortment of educational institutions offering programs on nearly every possible occupation or avocation. There are two main universities (Simon Fraser University, and  University of British Columbia). Polytechnic institutions offer degrees in addition to certificates and diplomas.  Vancouver is also a popular destination to learn English: expect to see many learners from Asian countries, such as South Korea, and from Brazil.\nPlaces of study within the city of Vancouver include:\n\nThe University of British Columbia (UBC), is ranked as one of the world's 30 best universities and is the largest university in western Canada. It is publicly funded and has the highest student enrollment of any university in British Columbia.  More than 50,000 full-time and part-time students in numerous disciplines are enrolled at the main campus in the UBC-Point Grey area. UBC also has a downtown campus in Vancouver at Robson Square in the city centre area. This location is geared more towards adult learning, business people and foreign students.

It offers over 120 programs, including career, vocational trades and technology certificates, diplomas, and degrees across numerous disciplines.\nDouglas College is a publicly funded and offers degrees with campuses in New Westminster and Coquitlam.\nTrinity Western University (TWU) is a private Christian university with undergraduate and graduate studies programs.  Its main campus is in Langley and it has a smaller campus in Richmond.\n\n\n== Work ==\nTraditionally, much of Vancouver's industry has centred around its port facilities and the forestry and mining sectors. Although these industries are still important to the economy, Vancouver's largest employers are now the various hospitals and educational institutions in the area and companies with head offices in Vancouver such as Telus Corp and the Jim Pattison Group. Vancouver however has expanded as a centre for software development and biotechnology, while streets provide a backdrop for an active film industry. Many jobs exist in the varied small and medium sized businesses that operate in the region.  As with many cities, jobs are posted on-line or in the newspaper, but it helps if you have some contacts within the industry that can point you to the jobs that are open but not posted.\nAs with any tourist centre, there are a number of service jobs available.  The attractions, restaurants and hotels downtown frequently need staff.  Other areas to consider are Granville Island and the North Shore with its ski areas and Grouse Mountain.\n\n\n== Buy ==\nThis is only a sample of things you can look for in Vancouver. Visit the separate district pages for other info.\nTip - There are two local taxes that are charged on the vast majority of goods, the 7% PST (Provincial Sales Tax) and the 5% GST (Goods and Services Tax).\nThe PST does not apply to restaurants, motor fuel, food (including non-alcoholic drinks), vitamins, books, newspaper, magazines, bicycles, and children's clothing.\n\n Robson Street. In the City Centre is home to many touristy shops. The neighbouring Alberni intersection is also home to a variety of high-end shops such as Louis Vuitton and Herm\u00e8s.  (updated Aug 2022)\n Pacific Centre. Located in the City Centre. Has more than 150 shops, restaurants and services if you want to walk in an underground shopping centre. The shopping centre begins at its north end at Robson Street, and stretches all the way to Pender Street. There are many floors in the mall depending on where you are, and notable merchants include Holt Renfrew, Harry Rosen, Gap, H&M and Apple Store; the mall is connected to the Hudson's Bay (at Georgia and Granville streets), and Vancouver Centre (a small mall mainly consisting of a lotto centre, London Drugs, and a food court underneath Scotiabank).  (updated Mar 2023)\n\n Gastown. Is the oldest neighbourhood in Vancouver but is being reborn as a fashion and modern urban design district. Historic buildings house hip restaurants, galleries, and interior design and high-fashion shops. This area also is notable having the most tourist souvenir shops in the region.  (updated Aug 2022)\n Yaletown. Is also popular for its non-mainstream fashion boutiques and high-end salons. A few Popular Yaletown Shopping Streets are: Mainland St., Hamilton St., and Pacific Blvd. (updated Oct 2023)\n Granville Island. Is an interesting place to go if you fancy the arts. The area boasts a public market, an art school (Emily Carr University of Art + Design), shops, a world music instrument store, restaurants, theatres, galleries, a hotel, boat docks and more.  (updated Aug 2022)\n Kerrisdale (Area centred on 41st, between Maple St and Blenheim St,). Located in South Vancouver. Consisting of roughly a hundred or so boutique-like shops, restaurants, and stores (chain or otherwise) in an affluent neighbourhood.  (updated Aug 2022)\n Commercial Drive. Especially the stretch between 3rd Avenue and Venables St. in East Van, is great for people-watching, produce (Santa Barbara Market), cheese (La Grotta del Formaggio), sausage (JN&Z Deli), etc.  (updated Aug 2022)\n Main Street (South Main). Located in Mt Pleasant. South of Broadway stretching to around 30th Avenue, has a vibrant and expanding collection of independent restaurants, caf\u00e9s, high-end niche clothing stores and small boutiques.  (updated Oct 2023)\n East Hastings. Located in East Van between Renfrew and Clark offers some of the best hidden delights in the city. There are many eclectic produce stores (Donald's Market).  (updated Oct 2023)\n Chinatown (Around Main and Pender, and westwards down Pender from Main.). An old historic landmark where the first Chinese immigrants to the area settled, though these days it is a shadow of its former self, having become largely deserted and full of homeless people. Other newer and more vibrant Chinatowns have sprung up around 41st Ave. and Victoria Drive, also in Richmond and Surrey, and are much better places to go to if authentic Chinese culture and food is what you are after.  (updated Aug 2022)\n Punjabi Market. Around Main, between 41st and 49th Ave. Good, cheap Punjabi food along with some Punjabi fashion; street signs are correspondingly in Punjabi.  (updated Oct 2023)\nThere are some unique shopping areas in Kitsilano and East Van. In Kits you can visit the first store of Vancouver-born and based athletic retailer, Lululemon Athletica, sporting popular yoga-inspired apparel. Gore-tex jackets are ubiquitous in Vancouver and the best place to buy them is at Mountain Equipment Co-op, Taiga Works or one of the other outdoorsy stores clustered together on the east-west main drag called Broadway (equivalent to 9th Avenue, running between 8th and 10th) between Cambie St. and Main St., just east of the Kitsilano area.\n\n\n== Eat ==\nWhere to begin? There is something for everyone in this cosmopolitan city, and the variety of cuisines and price points have been described as a foodie's delight. In particular, you will find many different kinds of Asian food available. If you fancy sushi many places offer \"all you can eat\" lunches for $12, which offers food of a wildly varying quality. In general, the city is up there with some of the best cities in North America when it comes to food. If you can do without alcohol, you can usually have a pretty reasonable meal for under $12, and at one of the more expensive restaurants in the city, $70 will get you a four course feast with exquisite service.\nThe highest density of restaurants is in Kitsilano or the West End. The central business area has many of the high end restaurants either along Robson Street or associated with the many hotels in the downtown area. East Van tends to have many authentic ethnic restaurants.\nVancouver is also famous for its Cantonese restaurants, in particular because it received a huge number of top chefs from Hong Kong fleeing the impending handover back to China in the 1980s and 1990s. Because of this large diaspora from Hong Kong, the price and quality of dim sum, siu mei and other Cantonese dishes here is among the best in the world, with many even claiming that Vancouver's Cantonese food is better than that of Hong Kong and Guangdong. However, Vancouver's Chinatown is now a shadow of its former self, with most of the remaining restaurants being tourist traps serving mediocre food. These days, the best Chinese food can be found in the suburb of Richmond, with a majority of its inhabitants being ethnically Chinese. Restaurants are all over the place on No. 3 Rd, Westminster Hwy, Alexandra Rd, and on the many side streets just east of Richmond Centre.\nVancouver has  become a lot more vegetarian and vegan friendly. For exclusively veg-fare, there is Indigo Age downtown, the Naam in Kits, the Acorn on Main St, Meet in Gastown, Kokomo in Chinatown, Roots + Fruits in Strathcona, Eternal Abundance on the Drive, and Chomp in Hastings-Sunrise- to name only a few.\nMany Vancouver restaurants recommend you have a reservation, the majority of them use OpenTable, or other similar software; however, some require you to phone. Check on the restaurants website or Yelp page before you go to be sure you will be seated in a timely manner.\nFor budget travellers, pick up a Georgia Straight (a free local paper available all over the place), and clip two-for-one coupons from the food section.\nEvery January, the city holds a food festival with over 270 local restaurants, which offer prix-fixe menus. The program, Dine Out Vancouver, runs over 17 days and includes the cities new eateries, neighbourhood favourites and award-winners. In 2017, to will be held from January 20 to February 5.\nAlthough the vast majority of stores around Vancouver accept credit cards, small family-owned Chinese businesses and restaurants, more often than not, accept only cash. Very few businesses in the city accept cheques.\nVancouver is also known for its gourmet ice cream shops, with some of the more notable chains including Rain or Shine Ice Cream, Earnest Ice Cream and Bella Gelateria. While in Vancouver, make sure you try the \"London fog\" flavour, which is earl grey tea with fresh milk.\nFood safety inspection reports are available online from the local health authority, Vancouver Coastal Health.\n\n\n== Drink ==\nMost of the nightclubs are in the central business district, especially along the Granville Street strip, south of Robson and along Water Street in Gastown. There are a number of good local pubs in the various quieter neighbourhoods of the city, such as along Main Street or Broadway. Closing times for most of these pub-like establishments begin at 1AM; nightclubs close between 2AM-3AM with a very small number operating after-hours. Nightclubs with music, a DJ and a dance floor usually charge an entrance fee. Be aware that many nightclubs often have long lineup queues on weekends, which are usually self-imposed regardless of whether or not the establishment is near capacity to attract business. Flexibility and willingness to go early is key should nightlife become part of your travel plans.\nLiquor stores by 11PM at the latest close, while many are closed by 9PM, and there will exist no other legal options apart from drinking at an establishment beyond this time.\n\n\n=== Coffee ===\nOn Robson and Thurlow, there used to be two Starbucks kitty-corner to one another, hardly surprising as Starbucks is the most dominant of the three coffee shop chains found in Vancouver and it is claimed there are more Starbucks per capita in Vancouver than anywhere else. The other chains, Caffe Artigiano and Blenz, are found throughout downtown. JJ Bean is favoured among the locals and it's a great place to spend a few minutes to a few hours nursing a coffee and one of their ginormous muffins; there are ten locations scattered throughout the city. Bean Around the World is a popular coffee house chain with ten locations. Waves Coffee is popular with students for its 24-hour operations, and free Wi-Fi internet. For independent chains try Mario's on Dunsmuir and Howe; they have a unique feel and a slower pace than other coffee shops. Make sure not to miss Trees' cheesecakes and its roasted on-site organic coffees.\nVancouver has seen a rise of new independent coffee shops in the past three years, most of which focus on single-origin beans and a simpler approach to delicious coffee devoid of syrups and flavourings. Examples include: Matchstick, Kafka's, Revolver, 49th Parallel.\n\n\n=== Tea ===\nA distinctive local drink in Vancouver is called the London fog, which is similar to a latte except that it uses a shot of earl grey tea instead of espresso coffee. It is available at virtually every coffee shop in Vancouver.\nBubble tea (or boba tea) is also a popular drink among the Vancouver youth.  There are countless tea houses throughout Vancouver, the most notable being Dragon Ball Tea House on West King Edward Ave and Oak St.\n\n\n=== Beer ===\nVancouver offers a number of destinations for beer drinkers.  The largest is the Granville Island Brewery on Granville Island (tours are available). Other microbreweries are housed in brewpubs, popular ones include the Yaletown Brewing Company in Yaletown and Steamworks at the entrance to Gastown.  The Alibi Room, near Gastown, specializes in beers by Northwestern microbreweries as does the Cascade Room in South Main. Portland, also in South Main, is another craft beer venue that specializes in beers by Oregon based microbreweries.\nEast Vancouver, near Commercial Drive and E Hastings St, has become a hot spot for smaller craft breweries. This area is popular with locals who like to hit up a few different breweries, sampling beer and eating snacks like pepperoni sticks. There are over 10 breweries within walking distance of each other. Check out Storm Brewing, Callister Brewing, and Parallel 49 Brewing Company to name a few. $6 for a flight of 6 samples is standard, though some breweries such as Storm Brewing provide samples by donation.\nOlympic Village, in False Creek, is another craft brewing hot spot, with multiple craft breweries within walking distance of eachother, including 33 Acres Brewing Company, Brassneck Brewery, Main Street Brewing Co, and more. All of these breweries are easily accessible by public transit.\nIf you fancy a short journey outside of Vancouver proper, Port Moody is easily accessible by Skytrain and has another great strip of small local breweries. North Vancouver, a 15 min SeaBus ride from downtown, offers another cluster of breweries, cider mill, distillery, winery, and braggotery along their newly developing \"Brewery District\".\n\n\n== Sleep ==\nIn general, accommodations in Vancouver are on the expensive side. Most upscale hotel rooms begin at $200-250/night, although you can find reasonably priced ones in the $100-180 range quite often. Most motel rooms cost somewhere between $80-150/night. If you are lucky to find hostel accommodation, the cheapest of these will cost around $30/night, more reasonably between $35-50.\nThe City Centre is centrally for attractions and has the bulk of Vancouver's accommodation, including most of the high-end hotels and backpackers hostels. If you don't mind getting away from the chain hotels, there are a number of smaller boutique hotels outside of the central business district but still close to the action that are cheaper than the four and five star options downtown. Backpacker hostels are another cheap option with beds starting at $25 if you don't mind sharing a room.\nStaying outside the City Centre area may give you a wider choice of affordable accommodations. There are a few budget hotels/motels along Kingsway in East Van and Broadway in South Granville. A number of B&Bs and AirBnB rentals are also scattered throughout the city in each district.  If you want/need to stay close to the airport, Richmond has a number of hotels with varying degrees of luxury and price.\nFinally, if you don't mind driving or commuting in to see Vancouver, the suburbs also have some cheaper options. North Vancouver, Burnaby and New Westminster all have easy access to Vancouver via the public transit system. The closest Provincial Parks with campgrounds are near Maple Ridge (Golden Ears Provincial Park), Chilliwack, and Squamish.\nCamping in city parks is prohibited under Vancouver\u2019s by-laws. Travellers may hear a claim that it is legal to camp overnight in city parks in Victoria and Abbotsford; (due to court cases that permit the homeless to do); but whether this would also apply to Vancouver or extend to travellers looking to free camp is unknown. That said, a small number of mostly homeless people do camp in city parks and it seems the bylaw is not always enforced. If you decide to do this, avoid the Downtown Eastside (Gastown-Chinatown and points directly east), don\u2019t be disruptive, don\u2019t light fires and be aware of the risks of free camping/sleeping rough.\n\n\n== Connect ==\nIn an emergency, dial 9-1-1 from any phone, even mobile phones with no service. If you're subscribed to Rogers for mobile service, or you're roaming on their network, they support 1-1-2 as well as 9-1-1. All other carriers only support 9-1-1.\nThe telephone area codes 604, 778, and 236 overlap Vancouver and the surrounding area. This means the Lower Mainland requires ten-digit dialing, so you must dial the area code when making a local call. Calls out of the region (east of Langley, or north of Squamish, including to Whistler) require a 1 before the area code.\nAt payphones, local calls cost a flat 50 cents each. Be aware that many public phones have been removed, especially in the suburbs, due to the rise of cell phones. Downtown payphones are often broken, but the payphones at the downtown SkyTrain stations are almost always in service. Payphones can be used to call 911 free of charge.\nFree Wi-Fi is available at most hotels, caf\u00e9s, and restaurants, as well as practically everywhere downtown. The city operates over 500 free Wi-Fi hotspots throughout the city. A full list of the city operated wireless hotspots can be found here. Some Translink buses, skytrains, seabuses, as well as some stations and terminals also provide free Wi-Fi for transit passengers. Internet caf\u00e9s are not as popular as they once were, but several remain in Vancouver, charging hourly with all-day passes available.\n\n\n=== By mail ===\n2 Vancouver Main Post Office (Canada Post), 495 W Georgia St (W George St & Richards St). (retail counter) M-F 9AM-6PM. Postcodes for the greater Vancouver area typically range from V5J through V6Z. There are also other postcodes in the surrounding cities making up the greater Vancouver metropolitan area ranging from  V4A to V5J and from V7A to V7Y. Neighbourhood post office branches are within and operated by London Drugs, Shoppers Drug Mart, 7 Eleven and other retail stores contracted by Canada Post. They are marked with the red \"Canada Post\" signage and logo. (updated Nov 2022)\n\n\n== Stay safe ==\nVancouver is a great place to visit if you use common sense like keeping an eye on your possessions, knowing where you are going and avoiding alleys and unfamiliar areas at night should keep you out of trouble.  Unless involved in illegal activities (such as the drug trade), it is highly unlikely you will fall victim to any sort of violent crime. If you need emergency help, dial 911.\nLike any major metropolitan city, Vancouver has areas that should be travelled with caution.  The most notable is the Downtown Eastside (specifically Hastings Street between Abbott and Gore). This neighbourhood is infamous for homelessness, drug-use, and prostitution. As a result of these conditions, violence is quite a common problem. If you do accidentally stroll into the Downtown Eastside it is not difficult to find your way out, but if you get lost or feel uncomfortable the best thing to do is approach a police officer. Tourists exploring Gastown and Chinatown can easily wander into the Downtown Eastside unwittingly. Chinatown turns into a ghost town in the evening, and is mainly filled with homeless people, so you should avoid the area at night.\nIt's also wise to exercise caution in the Granville Mall area (Granville St between Smithe St and Hastings St) in the central business district on Friday and Saturday nights.  As Vancouver\u2019s bar and nightclub district, the sheer volume of people combined with alcohol consumption make disorderly conduct and rowdy behaviour fairly common. But this shouldn't act as a deterrent - if you're not looking for trouble, you probably won't find it, and there is a strong police presence. The streets at night in the Granville Mall area are usually (and quite literally) clogged with people at night time.  Such an enormous mix of people and alcohol can be a dangerous mix if you are not cautious.\nSome parts of the city have high rates of property crime. Theft from vehicles is especially problematic and parked cars with foreign or out-of-province plates are frequently targeted. The best thing is to not leave any money and valuables in plain view. Many of the locals use steering wheel locks to prevent vehicle theft.\nWhile using public transit, if you feel unsafe, approach a Transit police officer (usually at SkyTrain stations). For non-emergency requests, you can call \u260f +1-604-515-8300.\nPanhandling is common in some parts of downtown, but is unlikely to pose a problem. Don't be rude, as there may be negative consequences.\n\n\n=== Drugs ===\nCannabis can be purchased from private dispensaries or the government-run BC Cannabis stores, which also offer online sales. It's legal for adults over 19 to consume and possess up to 30 grams of cannabis. It is not permitted to smoke or vape cannabis anywhere tobacco use is prohibited.\nThere are serious penalties for driving under the influence of THC, which include fines and vehicle seizure. Also, while Washington State has legalized recreational cannabis at the state level it remains illegal to bring any cannabis products over the border in either direction. Do not buy cannabis in Canada and attempt to take it into Washington State, or vice versa, not even at out of the way crossings like Point Roberts.\nThe province of British Columbia is the first jurisdiction in the world to decriminalize possession of hard drugs. Possession of up to 2.5 grams of cocaine (crack and powder), methamphetamine, MDMA, and opioids (including heroin, fentanyl and morphine) is no longer a criminal offence. In some areas such as\nDowntown Eastside, the government provides safe injection sites where you can safely dispose off needles after injecting yourself. The exemption is scheduled to last until Jan 31, 2026. \nDriving while under the influence of drugs is a crime. Anyone caught selling drugs or trafficking them will still face criminal penalties. Possessing hard drugs at airports and many other locations remains illegal.\n\n\n== Cope ==\n\n\n=== Publications ===\n Vancouver Sun. Vancouver's biggest daily newspaper.

Another option is Public Mobile, which operates mostly online only, but SIMs can be purchased at London Drugs and generally costs less than other providers. Many wireless carriers offer out of country travel plans; inquire with your carrier regarding pricing before your trip.\n\n\n=== Religious services ===\nAnglican (Episcopal):  Christ Church Cathedral, 690 Burrard St, \u260f +1 604-682-3848.

Every winter, St. Paul's decorates the front of the Hospital with lights to encourage charitable donations.

Some of the most popular are listed below. All of these places are accessible by public transit, or if you have a car, within an hour's drive.\n\nNorth Vancouver - Take in the views from Grouse Mountain (The Peak of Vancouver), go for a walk on a suspension bridge or enjoy one of the many outdoor recreation opportunities -- hiking, mountain biking, skiing/snowboarding, kayaking -- on offer. The most popular summer activity in the area is hiking the 'Grouse Grind', a 2.9-km, 853-m elevation gain hike up the side of Grouse mountain.\nWest Vancouver - A municipality north of the Lion's gate bridge, en route to Whistler. Home to many beaches, coves, parks and expensive real estate, where breathtaking views of Vancouver can be scoped by driving its higher altitudes.\nBurnaby - Shop till you drop at Metropolis at Metrotown, the largest shopping mall in British Columbia, or relax at one of the large regional parks. Also home to Simon Fraser University's main campus (notable for its brutalist architecture), on top of Burnaby mountain.\nPort Coquitlam, Coquitlam and Port Moody (the Tri City area) - Half hour drive down Hastings street to the Barnet Highway will bring you to Port Moody, locally known as the City of the Arts.\nRichmond - City with a large Asian influence with many options for Chinese, Japanese and Korean dining and shopping, one of the largest Buddhist temples in North America and the historic seaside Steveston towards the south offers a quieter, small-town type atmosphere.\nSurrey/White Rock - A 45 minute drive away from Vancouver, famous for its moderate climate and sandy beaches.  Surrey is also the place to go for South Asian shopping and watching Bollywood movies.\nFort Langley - Village with unique shops, restaurants and the site of one of the first forts built in British Columbia.\nNew Westminster - Small city on the banks of the Fraser River that was once the capital of British Columbia.\nDelta - Made up of three communities separated by farmland; North Delta, Ladner, and Tsawwassen. Ladner has a quaint village-like atmosphere which has attracted several movies to be shot there and is the home of the George C. Reifel Migratory Bird Sanctuary. Tsawwassen has Boundary Bay Regional Park with its walking trails and bird watching opportunities.\n\n\n=== Day trips ===\nBowen Island is a popular day trip or weekend excursion offering kayaking, hiking, shops, restaurants, and more. This authentic community is in Howe Sound just off Vancouver, and is accessed by ferry from Horseshoe Bay in West Vancouver.\nFor those who enjoy outdoor activities, a trek up the Sea to Sky corridor is essential. Squamish has branded itself the \"Outdoor Recreation Capital of Canada\" and with an incredible amount of quality rock climbing, mountain biking, white water rafting, hiking, kayaking, horseback riding, fishing, golf, walking trails and more, it certainly deserves the title. Squamish is about half way between Vancouver and Whistler. Whistler (1.5-hour drive from Vancouver) is expensive but well-known because of the 2010 Winter Olympics. In the winter, enjoy some of the best skiing in North America, and in the summer try some authentic mountain biking.\nAnother good spot for outdoor activities is Mount Baker across the border in Washington. Driving time is about three hours, but border line-ups can add anywhere from a few minutes to several hours onto your trip.\nThe nearby Fraser Valley has a number of parks and lakes that are nice for fishing, hiking or relaxing.  A popular lake beach destination is in Harrison Hot Springs.\nA geopolitical oddity: Point Roberts, a village that's part of the United States but can only be reached by land through Delta, BC.\n\n\n=== Further afield ===\nVancouver Island is a good spot to move on to from Vancouver. Victoria, British Columbia's capital, is a relaxing place. Tofino is a pretty spot on the island's west coast, good for whale and storm watching and has some of Canada's best surf (if you can brave the cold water). The island is reached by ferry, seaplane and bus.\nThe Southern Gulf Islands are also a short ferry ride or float plane flight away. The Southern Gulf Islands are known for their artist communities, wineries, fromageries and farms. These islands also boast incredible opportunities for boating, kayaking, hiking, camping and wildlife viewing in the Gulf Islands National Park Reserve.\nThe Okanagan is a four to five hour drive east, with a large number of wineries, water activities in the summer and skiing in the winter.\nThe scenery of Banff, Banff National Park and the Rocky Mountains is a long day's drive (8-9 hours) east.\nTo the south, in the United States, Seattle is a two and a half hour drive and Portland is a five hour drive (excluding any border line-up)."

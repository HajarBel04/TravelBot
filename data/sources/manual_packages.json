        "title": "Lima",
        "extract": "Lima is the capital of Peru and its largest city. Founded in 1535 by the Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro, the modern city is a curious mix of the modern mega city with some 'islands of modernity', large but orderly slum areas and colonial architecture in downtown. Lima was the seat of Spanish rule for 300 years, and as such it has wonderful churches, cloisters and monasteries.\nLima is the best place to try Peruvian cuisine, which has a huge variety of ingredients from the coast, mountain and Amazon regions. The cold sea current that passes Peru's long coast makes the sea very rich in fish and seafood.\n\n\n== Districts ==\nThe following pages include the province of Callao and the province of Lima and their districts\n\n\n== Understand ==\n\nLima is a growing metropolis of about 11 million people. Many of these people have migrated from the highlands to find work in Lima, without success, leading to widespread poverty and unemployment, and sprawling shanty towns on the outskirts of the city.\nLima's pre-Hispanic and colonial architecture is beautiful and the city has several museums (such as the Museo Larco) that tells the story of a country with a long history that produced a large number of coastal and Andean civilizations (such as the Moche, Chavin, and the Incas) and many local cultures. There are several archaeological sites in and around the city (locally known as huaca).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe city is in a valley surrounded by an extremely arid desert, receiving on average no more than 3 cm of rain per year. The city is surprisingly green with many parks and trees, but all of them are artificially watered by the municipality! In the summer months, December to February, the weather is usually sunny and hot, with a UV index that is invariably extreme. Even a layer of factor 50 sun block won't offer protection for long, and it's recommended to stick to shaded areas as much as possible, which is problematic when visiting archaeological sites in the scorching sun. The rest of the year, the weather in Lima is overcast, and temperatures are between 20 - 30 C\u00b0 during day time, which seems chillier when combined with the general dampness. Air pollution in the streets of Lima can be very bad due to a combination of weather and older poorly-maintained vehicles.\n\n\n== Get in ==\n\n\n=== By plane ===\n1 Jorge Ch\u00e1vez International Airport (LIM  IATA), \u260f +51 1 511-6055. The airport is in Callao, a seaport city northwest of Lima, 11 km (6.8 mi) from the central historic core and 17 km (11 mi) from Miraflores.   (updated Jul 2015)\nThe airport is well connected with most cities in South America, and with some North American and European cities. Flights arrive daily from Amsterdam Schiphol (AMS IATA), Bogot\u00e1, Madrid Barajas(MAD IATA), Medell\u00edn, Miami Airport(MIA IATA), Quito, Santiago and Toronto. There are also regular flights from Atlanta Airport(ATL IATA), Fort Lauderdale, Houston George Bush Airport(IAH IATA), Newark Liberty Airport(EWR IATA) and London Gatwick(LGW IATA).\nLima is the hub for many national domestic flights and is served by LATAM, Jetsmart Per\u00fa, Sky Per\u00fa, and Star Per\u00fa (see below).\nThe airport has Wi-Fi (WIGO) for a fee.\n\n\n==== Airlines and destinations ====\nLATAM  (formerly LAN & TAM Airlines) - offers many international and domestic routes throughout the region, and to/from North America and Spain. It serves Antofagasta, Arequipa, Ayacucho, Barcelona, Bogot\u00e1, Bras\u00edlia, Buenos Aires\u2013Ezeiza, Cajamarca, Calama, Cali, Canc\u00fan, Cartagena, Chiclayo, Concepci\u00f3n, C\u00f3rdoba, Cuzco, Foz do Igua\u00e7u, Guayaquil, Havana, Ilo, Iquitos, Ja\u00e9n, Jauja, Juliaca, La Paz, Los Angeles, Madrid, Medell\u00edn\u2013JMC, Mendoza, Mexico City, Miami, Montego Bay, Montevideo, New York\u2013JFK, Orlando, Piura, Porto Alegre, Pucallpa, Puerto Maldonado, Punta Cana, Quito, Rio de Janeiro\u2013Gale\u00e3o, Rosario, Salta, San Jos\u00e9 (CR), San Miguel de Tucum\u00e1n, Santa Cruz de la Sierra\u2013Viru Viru, Santiago, S\u00e3o Paulo\u2013Guarulhos, Tacna, Talara, Tarapoto, Trujillo, Tumbes\nAvianca (formerly Taca Peru) serves Bogota.\nEurope is served by Air Europa, British Airways, Air France, Iberia, Plus Ultra L\u00edneas A\u00e9reas and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines\nUSA is served by American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, JetBlue, United Airlines, Spirit Airlines and LATAM\nCanada is served by Air Canada\nOther Latin American airlines include Avianca (Bogota); Copa Airlines and Wingo (Panama City); and Aerom\u00e9xico (Mexico City)); Gol (S\u00e3o Paulo\u2013Guarulhos); JetSmart  (Antofagasta, Concepci\u00f3n, and Santiago); Sky Airlines/Sky Peru (Cancun, Miami, Santiago); Avior Airlines and Estelar Latinoamerica (Caracas); and Aerol\u00edneas Argentinas (Buenos Aires)\nOther domestic carriers include:\n\nATSA (Atalaya, Chachapoyas, Hu\u00e1nuco, Tingo Mar\u00eda)\nJetsmart Peru (Arequipa, Cajamarca, Chiclayo, Cusco, Piura, Tarapoto, Trujillo)\nStar Peru (Cajamarca, Chiclayo, Huanuco, Iquitos, Pucallpa, Tarapoto)\nSKY Peru (Arequipa, Cuzco, Iquitos, Juliaca, Jauja, Piura, Pucallpa, Tarapoto, Trujillo, Tumbes)\n\n\n==== Arrival ====\nArrival at the airport can be chaotic. Most flights from overseas arrive in clumps either early in the morning or very late at night, which means that getting through immigration and customs can be tremendously time consuming; the time between arrival at the gate and exiting customs can range from 20-90 minutes.\nThe area immediately outside of customs is typically crowded, full of people waiting for arriving passengers. It's not uncommon for entire families to show up to greet a returning family member and the crowd is further swelled by pre-booked car and taxi service drivers holding up signs with passengers' names; a large area where passengers can stand freely and scan the crowd to look for people and not be accosted has been cordoned off in front of the customs exit.\nAs soon as you go outside, you will be accosted by numerous aggressive taxi drivers.  They are persistent and will keep bothering you as long as you are there.  If you are looking for a bus or shuttle, figure out in advance where you need to go, and do not allow the taxi drivers to \"help\" you find it.  If you have booked a rideshare (e.g. Uber), be aware that some taxi drivers may pretend to be your Uber driver, even holding up an Uber app on their phone.  Ask for their name and verify it is the actual driver you booked, and check the license plate.\n\n\n==== Transit ====\nIf you are transiting through Lima, the airport has a separate hall for connecting international passengers, who need not pass through Peruvian immigration or customs, but will have to pass through a security checkpoint dedicated to screening connecting passengers before they can enter the secure area of the terminal where the international gates are located. Due to congestion, the airport often does not assign gates to flights until less than two hours before departure.\n\n\n==== Taxis ====\nBe wary of taxi drivers at the airport: if you need transportation from the airport you should avoid using the informal taxis outside that will accost you.\nYou can hire a taxi and pay for it at the desks Green Taxi, Taxi365 and others inside the customs reception area at somewhat inflated fees, or book one ahead of time online with a reputable company. A trip to the Centro Historico from Green Taxi is S/55 (soles) (Feb 2018), or S/65 to Miraflores (Feb 2024). These certified companies are safe.\nOnce you leave the grounds of the airport, things get much cheaper rather rapidly and a trip to Miraflores shouldn't cost you any more than S/25-30, but it is not as safe. The area around the airport is unsafe in general and taxi drivers can be dangerous. The taxis waiting right outside the terminal but within the grounds are more safe than the ones outside and cheaper than the ones inside. Check out the tips for taking the taxi safely underneath.\nAlways make sure in which currency they are giving the price. 25 soles and 25 dollars is a big difference.\n\n\n==== Express airport bus ====\nThere is an hourly express bus between the airport and four stops in Miraflores. A one-way ticket costs 20 Soles. The last bus leaves at 10:00 PM.\n\n\n==== Car rentals ====\nCar rental is available at the airport via Avis, Budget, Hertz, National and Sixt, as well as local car rental companies. Car rental booths for all companies (except Sixt, where a representative will meet you at the arrivals hall and will then take you to your vehicle) are located after baggage claim and customs but before the exit to the arrivals hall if arriving on an international flight, or right at the arrivals hall if arriving on a domestic flight.\n\n\n=== By bus ===\nThe bus station is right outside the airport grounds exit to your right. To get into Miraflores you can take the blue 18 bus or a micro. It says Miraflores on the side but confirm with the bus driver. A ride to Miraflores will cost you S/2. The area surrounding the airport is a bit dodgy. If travelling with all or any valuables and especially at night, it is recommended to take the Airport Express Lima bus instead, which will cost you US$12 for a return ticket or a taxi within the airport grounds, which costs about US$20 one way. The public bus to Miraflores takes 1-3 hours depending on traffic, while a taxi or Airport Express Lima should take under an hour.\nMost companies have their terminals lined up along Paseo de la Republica (north & south) in La Victoria, not Lima's nicest district. However. Other stations are in the outskirts of La Victoria (Av. Javier Prado and along Paseo de la Republica), which is better. There you find some of the more reputable companies like Cruz del Sur, Tepsa, Orme\u00f1o, Linea, ITTSA, Movil Tours, Flores and Civa. Some of the same companies have multiple terminals in La Victoria, service to Gran Terminal Terrestre Plaza Norte in T\u00fapac Amaru in the northern part of town; and in/around Acotongo in the southern part of town.\nIf you are staying in the North Lima area or close to the airport, there is a modern bus terminal: Gran Terminal Terrestre Plaza Norte, which is very convenient. It should take you around 10 minutes to get there from the airport by the Avenida Tom\u00e1s Valle in a combi or taxi (there are no buses along the whole length of this avenue).\nRegular buses run up and down the roads Panamericana Sur/Norte (the local name for the Panamerican Highway), Carretera Central, Interoce\u00e1nica Sur, Interoce\u00e1nica Norte, amongst others:\n\nSouth: Pisco, Ica, Nazca, Arequipa, Tacna, Cuzco, Puerto Maldonado, Juliaca, Puno, Moquegua, Ilo.\nNorth: Huaraz, Chimbote, Trujillo, Chiclayo, Piura, Cajamarca & Tumbes.\nEast: Huancayo, Cerro de Pasco, Hu\u00e1nuco and Pucallpa.\n\n\n==== Companies and terminals ====\nSome of the major bus companies and their terminal locations:\n\n Airport Express Lima, Lima Airport (They have two ticket counters at Lima Airport), \u260f +51 1 446 55 39, info@airportexpresslima.com.

(updated Apr 2016)\n\n\n=== By train ===\nThe Peruvian rail network has been neglected for a long time and it is now used for freight and as a tourist attraction first and foremost. ferrocarril central runs the occasional passenger train from Huancayo.\n\n2 Desamparados railway station (Estaci\u00f3n de Desamparados).   (updated Apr 2021)\n\n\n== Get around ==\n\n\n=== By public transit ===\n\nLima's public transport network consists of a single metro line, modern buses, coasters and combis (which are called \"micros\" by the locals). The system can be confusing for foreign tourists.\n\n\n==== Metro ====\nThe  1 Lima Metro.    is a newish subway system that is being developed. As of 2022, only Line 1 exists; it serves 33 stations through 11 districts. It is an elevated line, which runs in the general north-south direction in the eastern part of the Lima metropolitan areas (2-3 km east of Lima's historical center and Miraflores), and, as such, does not serve many locations where tourists are likely to stay of visit. \nLine 2, to run in the east-west direction toward Callao, is under construction, and is expected to open in 2024; once it's opened, the attractiveness of the metro system for the visitors is likely to significantly increase.\n\n\n==== Bus rapid transit (Metropolitano) ====\nThe   Metropolitano.    is a modern rapid transport bus system, operated with fully wheelchair-accessible articulated (\"bendy\") buses. The stations are spaced at 1 km or so, and the buses mostly travel on their own dedicated lanes on expressways, which means that traveling on this system is indeed much faster than on regular buses.\nIt operates similarly to a subway system: you enter a station through a card-operated turnstile, travel as you wish within the system, and exit your destination system via a turnstile as well. (A card is not needed for exit, as the fare is flat is not distance-based).\nThere is basically one route, running from the northern suburbs to Lima's city center to the southern suburbs of San Isidro and Miraflores, although it splits in two for a short stretch in the city center. There are different \"services\", however, which differ primarily at which stations they stop (express vs. limited stops vs. local), and at which branch they take around the downtown.\nRechargeable cards are used as tickets; as of February 2022, one pays S/4.5 for the card (non-refundable), and S/2.50 for an adult fare. The minimum initial purchase price of a card is S/5 (S/4.50 for the card, and S/0.50 toward fares).\nIf you only need to ride the system once or twice during your trip, and don't want to buy a card, you can try to offer S/2.50 to some  passenger who's not to busy (e.g. walking out of the system) so that he or she puts the money on his or her card and then lets you into the station with his/her card. You don't need a card to leave the system.\nWhile some of the stations of the system have a single platform for northbound and southbound buses, some stations are physically split into two, one for northbound and the other for southbound buses; so make sure to read the signs before paying your fare to enter a station!\nAdditionally, the Metropolitano operates several \"feeder rutes\" (rutas alimentadoras) that  run on local streets in the vicinity of the northern and southern terminals of the main line, bringing passengers to those terminals. Those routes are numbered started with AN- and AS-, respectively.\nThe public transport authority (Autoridad de Transporte Urbano) has a smartphone app on its web site with information about both the BRT routes and other municipal buses (see below).\n\n\n==== Municipal buses ====\nBesides the BRT, the city also operates large modern buses along at least a couple of \"trunk routes\" (ruta troncal) or \"corridors\" (corredores). Known as Corredores Complementarios, they form  part of an integrated transport system with the BRT. There are at 4 corridores, including:\n\nBlue (corredor azul): along avenues Tacna, Garcilaso, and Arequipa. Particularly useful for traveling between downtown Lima and San Isidro and Miraflores); routes 301 ... 306.\nRed (corredor rojo): along Javier Prado - La Marina - red). (routes 201 ... 257)\nPurple  (corredor morado) (routes 404 ... 412)\nYellow (corredor amarillo) (route  107)\nThe municipal buses have clearly labeled stops (paraderos), with signs and benches, at least along the main corridors. The bus route number are usually made out of three digits (e.g. 301). The fare is around S/1.5, and is supposed to be paid with a card as well. However, is a passenger does not have a card, the driver will take your cash and will scan his card as well.\nThere is more information on these buses in the Spanish Wikipedia page Corredores complementarios.\n\n\n==== Private buses ====\nUnfortunately, municipal buses run far from everywhere; they don't go anywhere near the airport. Thus, most of Lima is still served primarily by small private buses, provided by a variety of companies, whose numbers usually consist of one or two letters and some digits. For example, to go from the airport to Magdalena, Miraflores or Surco, you can take the big blue bus called \"Las Flores 18\" (IM-18). The fare is S/2 (Miraflores) or S/2.50 (Surco).\nOn the side of every bus or van you will see the names of the major avenues it travels along. While Google Maps will show you where bus stops are, this is merely a suggestion; stops are not physically marked, and a bus, in general, can stop anywhere the driver feels reasonable, based on the desires of the passengers inside and the apparent existence of potential passengers outside.\nConductors generally lean out the door of the bus (which typically never closes) yelling the destinations. If this doesn't make sense, ask the conductor. Also here be aware of pickpockets.\nWhile no \"official\" system map for the private buses seems to exist, a reasonably good directory of them is maintained at the\nWikiroutes site. There is also a smartphone app, Tu Ruta.\n\n\n=== By taxi ===\nIf going further, a taxi ride between adjacent neighbourhoods costs about S/7-10 (US$2-3), if you speak Spanish well enough. A longer ride may cost from S/24-34 (US$7\u201310). A reasonable price for a taxi service between the airport and Miraflores is about S/65 (US$25), but may cost more from within the airport. By custom, taxis do not have meters; rather, the fare should be negotiated before boarding the taxi, or, if you order by phone, at booking time. If asking for a ride on the street, don't be fooled into getting into the cab before a rate is negotiated.  Be very discerning about which taxi you choose and avoid hailing random cabs off the street as much as possible.\nCaution is advised when using taxis in Lima. In Lima the shared taxis are prohibited, but there are some taxis colectivos pirata, and it might not hurt to look if there's someone hiding on the back seat or the trunk before entering.\nFirst-time travellers to Peru need nerves of steel with regard to the traffic. Lima harbours the most lunatic drivers in the world and taxi drivers are among the worst.\nMaintenance of any mechanical object in Peru, (including taxis) is only performed once it has already ceased to function.  Many cars are in very poor, even unsafe, condition. It's very common to see cars and taxis with missing windows or body parts.\nIf you don't know a trusted taxi, it's wise to use the public transport.\nTips for taking the taxi safely:\n\nDo not show any valuables (including jewelry) and try to look a bit shabby.\nSpeaking Spanish with confidence to your driver helps.\nBefore asking for a taxi, ask several people (not taxi drivers) for the regular price. If the driver you talk to goes under that price, he might be looking to make money some other way.\nTuck away your phone and passport where they will not look for it or see it.\nKnow where you are going, know the route or at least pretend you know. Always look like you are paying attention but stay calm.\nIf they start talking to you, mention that people are waiting for you, that you know local people and this is not your first time in Lima.\nKeep an eye on whether the driver is communicating with you.\nWhen in doubt, do not get in! There are literally a hundred others waiting for you. If you have doubts after entering the taxi, just get out somewhere it seems kind of safe and pay him full price. You can also ask him to take a different route that you choose.\nNever show the address or directions on your phone. Remember the address or write it down.\nThe taxi driver might take you to a location different from your destination where others are waiting and/or threaten you with a gun or knife. By the time you get to your hotel or hostel you will not have your passport, money, backpack or anything else for that matter. Even though most of the taxis in the center of the city are quite safe, be extra careful around the airport, in bad neighbourhoods and especially the bus stations.\n\n\n==== Rideshare ====\nBoth Cabify and Uber are available in Lima, although you may have to wait a few minutes at rush hour, or if your trip is too short.  Rideshare is not allowed to the airport, however.\n\n\n=== By bike ===\nBicycling is fairly popular in the Greater Lima. While the authorities of the region and those of some districts encourage bicycling, e.g. by creating bike lanes (cyclovia) on some streets, this activity remains somewhat dangerous due to the chaotic nature of the traffic throughout most of the metro area. Some of the routes, such as the one along the ocean shore, are quite pleasant though.\nThe service with a rather misleading name, City Bike Lima exists for renting bicycles from the bike parking stations. Unfortunately, it should be more properly named \"City Bike Miraflores\": as of early 2022 it only covers the single district of Miraflores. Plans exists for extending the service to the neighboring San Isidro.\nBike shops are fairly numerous, and are spread throughout the metro area. The greatest concentration of them appears to exist a few blocks east of downtown, in Jiron Luna Pizarro between Avenida Miguel Grau and Jiron Antonio Raimondi, and adjacent blocks. \n(For the map location, see, e.g., https://goo.gl/maps/vw6MnDUpGiQkREcw8 ). So this may be not a bad area to shop for spare parts, etc. This area is very busy though, as it also has a lot of bus stations; so watch out for pickpockets and other annoyances.\n\n\n=== By car ===\n\nUnless you have experience driving in extremely challenging environments it is normally not recommended to drive around Lima. Traffic jams are common everywhere, the street network is sprawling and confusingly laid out, road quality in many parts of the city is poor, and Peruvians' reputation for being some of the world's worst drivers can precede them, even in the capital. However, having a car does give the flexibility to effectively go around the city's confusing public transit system, as well as access to harder-to-reach sites like Pachacamac and points further from the city.\nSome parts of Lima are easier to drive around than others. Navigating around central Lima with its colonial-era narrow streets, heavy pedestrian traffic (including several pedestrianized streets around the Centro Hist\u00f3rico and the many street vendors in the Barrio Chino) and lack of parking can be stressful, whereas driving around newer areas of the city like Miraflores, Barranco, San Borja or Santiago de Surco with their wider streets and segregated pedestrian traffic can be somewhat easier on the nerves. Conditions can change rapidly depending on where you are driving to and which part of Lima you find yourself in. Generally, if you are staying in an area with easy access to public transit and are going somewhere that is similarly accessible, it is advisable to ditch the car and take public transit instead.\nLima is the center of Peru's highway network, with key routes like the Panamericana (Norte and Sur) converging here. Other important routes include the Costa Verde which runs along the coast, Avenida Paseo de la Rep\u00fablica (nicknamed El Zanj\u00f3n, or the Big Ditch) on which the Metropolitano runs, and the Anillo Perif\u00e9rico which runs around the city. Most highways are tolled along several stretches, and while tolls may be paid with credit cards they mostly don't work with foreign cards, so make sure to have cash handy. GPS navigation is generally accurate and can be very useful for navigating around Lima.\nPaid parking is available but expensive, usually around S/5-7 an hour, but many establishments (including tourist hotspots like the Museo Larco and Pachacamac) have free parking for guests, especially outside the city center. Designated street parking is common and usually free (exceptions include the area around the entrance to the Fortaleza del Real Felipe in Callao, where street parking is S/5 but is good for the whole day), but it is generally recommended to park in an enclosed parking garage to avoid any possible damage to your car. Despite the availability of street parking Lima drivers are notorious for parking on the street in no-parking zones, which are marked with yellow curbs and no parking signs. Even if there are cars parked on the street illegally and you see locals parking there, don't do it. Parking enforcement may be uneven, but it does happen and you risk your car being towed.\nExercise caution when driving around Lima late at night, as drivers are much more likely to violate traffic rules, including running red lights.\n\n\n== See ==\n\nThe historic downtown, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nThe Circuito M\u00e1gico del Agua (Magic Water Tour), a fountain and light display in the Parque de la Reserva and Parque Ferm\u00edn Tang\u00fcis.\nThe Parque del Amor (Lovers' Park) in Miraflores.\nThe Costa Verde, Lima's impressive green coast stretches between San Miguel and Chorrillos.\nThe tourist-friendly districts of Barranco, Miraflores and Santiago de Surco.\nThe historical sites of Pueblo Libre, including the Cruz del Viajero, a monumental Christian cross dating from the era of the Conquistadores.\nLima's best shopping malls: Plaza Norte, Jockey Plaza, Larcomar, Mall Aventura Plaza, Real Plaza Salaverry.\nHistorical churches: Lima\u00b4s Cathedral, Santo Domingo (San Mart\u00edn de Porres), Santa Rosa (Santa Rosa de Lima), Nazarenas (Se\u00f1or de los Milagros), San Francisco.\nMuseums: Museo nacional de Arqueolog\u00eda, Antropolog\u00eda e Historia (Pueblo Libre), Museo de Arte (Paseo Col\u00f3n), Museo Pedro de Osma (Barranco), Museo Rafael Larco (Pueblo Libre).\nParque Kennedy in the center of Miraflores.

You can't even change the currency from neighbouring countries (besides Chile) in normal money exchanges and banks. You might find more flexible exchange offices at the airport, but they often charge ridiculous service fees and exchange rates.\nChanging money in Miraflores can be done safely with cambistas on the street, but you must follow a few simple rules to avoid being cheated.  First, make sure that the cambista is wearing the vest-uniform indicating that he or she is an authorized, licensed cambista.  Always ask for the exchange rate (\"tipo de cambio\").  It is worth it to compare with several cambistas, especially if you are changing a significant amount of money. Some scammers do tricks with their calculators in your face and you won't notice, so the best way to know how much you should be getting is to bring a calculator yourself or use the one in your cellphone. Finally, make sure that the bills the cambista gives you have his or her seal (\"sello\") stamped on them - that way, if by chance one of them turns out to be counterfeit you can come back and complain. It is rare to get counterfeit notes from a cambista, but asking for the seal helps maintain the incentive for honesty and acts as insurance for you.\n\n\n=== Withdraw ===\nAs anywhere, your best bet is usually to draw soles from an ATM. There are banks dotted all over Lima and some of them have guarded ATMs. Chances are the bank will charge you a fortune every time you withdraw money so it is better value to get as much as possible when making a withdrawal. BCP cajeros generally allow withdrawals up to S/700. Interbank has been known to charge insane fees (around US$18 for a US$50 transaction).\nAlways be cautious when using an ATM, as you may be followed and targeted for a robbery.\n\n\n=== Shop ===\n\n\n==== Musical instruments ====\nIf you are interested in purchasing Peruvian folk musical instruments, there are stores selling charangos, quenas, antaras, etc., on Ca. Cantuarias.  If you have the time, a number of these stores can help you find a teacher to learn how to play your purchase.\n\n\n==== Handicrafts ====\nYour best bet is to head for Av. Petit Thouars in Miraflores, which is full of handicrafts stores. Or, go to Av. La Marina in Pueblo Libre.\n\n\n==== Supermarkets ====\nThe main supermarkets are Wong, Metro, Plaza Vea, Vivanda and Tottus. These can be found all over.\n\n\n== Eat ==\n\nGastronomy has been, since the days of the Spanish vice royalty, an essential aspect of life in Lima. During the last few years, the city's dining reputation has experienced a huge leap in the eyes of the world, due in part to the International Summit of Gastronomy (Madrid Fusi\u00f3n) in 2006, which declared Lima to be the \"Gastronomy Capital of the Americas\". The offerings in Lima are nowadays more varied and cover a wide range of types and cuisines, both regional and international.\nDespite the wide range of choice in Lima's many restaurants, ceviche is surely number one on the list of dishes you must get to know, not only because it happens to be the Peruvian national dish, but because of its unparalleled delicious taste. With the increasing interest in the Peruvian cuisine, ceviche is quickly making its way onto tables all over the world. But if you want to enjoy the real thing, don't miss it during your stay here in ceviche's mecca. There is at least one cevicher\u00eda in every neighbourhood. Moreover, most criollo restaurants include ceviche on their menus; indeed the dish is so popular that it is even offered at many of the more upscale nouvelle-cuisine restaurants.\nIn some places, Peruvian food tend to be spicy and heavy. Try it and ask if any dish is picante (spicy), which usually means it is going to be very spicy! A full meal may be really heavy even if it's perfectly nice and well-prepared with fresh ingredients.\nA second must goes to Chinese and Japanese cuisines, which predictably, have a strong Peruvian influence. Chifas - that is, Chinese restaurants- - which can be counted by the hundreds if not thousands, are usually down-to-earth neighbourhood eateries, offering a fare rich in seafood and chicken. Japanese restaurants, on the contrary, are less widespread, and more upscale and expensive. Their forte is, of course, a year-round supply of the freshest and most varied seafood.\nTravellers longing for a delicious falafel or shwarma sandwich will be pleased to learn there is an excellent caf\u00e9 in Parque Kennedy that serves these type of Middle Eastern foods at reasonable prices.\nThere is a heavy presence of fast-food chains such as KFC, Pizza Hut, McDonald's, Subway, Papa John's and local chain Bembos all over the city. Places such as Burger King, Chili's and TGI Friday's are scarce, but can be found around Miraflores. Also, you shouldn't miss Peruvian-style hamburgers at Bembos, and traditional Peruvian sandwiches in if you want to give your everyday fast-food a local twist.\n\n\n== Drink ==\nPisco Sour is the national drink of Peru, made with Pisco, a brandy made of grapes. It is highly recommended that all visitors to Peru try this drink at least once. Visitors might be amused to learn that Chileans claim Pisco Sour is their own, but it isn't true. There are some variations that are offered in several bars around town. Just be careful; the fresh and sweet flavour makes it very easy to drink too much, and you can so easily get drunk on it.\nInca Kola is the most popular soft drink in Peru, one of few sodas that Coca Cola couldn't defeat (until they bought the company). It's a yellow-fruit flavored drink that tastes like hierba luisa.\nJugos You can find great fresh fruit drinks all over Lima. Starting from S/0.50 for a fresh orange juice at the market to some more expensive ones. Surtidos, containing several different fruits, are quite tasty.\nChicha Morada A refreshing, purple, non-alcoholic drink high in antioxidants. It's made by boiling purple corn with pineapple, cinnamon, clove, and sugar.\nEmoliente is a hot drink prepared with barley, herbs, sugar and lemon juice. It's often sold by street vendors at night for around S/1. It's especially great in winter.\nStarbucks Coffee is predictably widespread if you really need your daily caffeine fix.\n\n\n== Sleep ==\nSurco, Miraflores, San Borja and San Isidro are some of the nicest and safest areas in the city. Although they sometimes come a bit pricier than the old city center and other parts, some budget accommodation options do exist.\nKeep in mind that the old city may not be safe for tourists at night.\n\n\n== Stay safe ==\nIf you witness a crime being committed, do not intervene unless you are really sure of what you are doing: many criminals, even pickpockets, carry guns, knives, etc., and may use them if feeling threatened.\nIn general, a tried-and-true technique for staying safe in Lima is to maintain a low profile.  Leave your fancy watch at home, don't wear a fine suit and don't carry a laptop when hailing taxis on the street, and keep a relaxed, friendly, smiling attitude.  If you do need to go out dressed like a tourist, call a taxi rather than hire one in the moment - the few moments you wait and the few extra soles you pay will be worth it.\n\n\n=== Thieves ===\nWhile there is not much violent crime against tourists, opportunistic theft is rampant. Watch out for pickpockets constantly. If you carry a purse, a camera, a backpack or just a pair of sunglasses hang on to them at all times. In crowded areas, put your back pack on your front and hold shopping close to you. Just keep your eyes open and be aware of people around you. In any case, if someone extremely friendly approaches (even wanting to stretch your hand), just try not to talk that much, and they'll go away. It's normal to find polite people around trying to help tourists, but stay away from the extremely friendly ones.\n\n\n=== Football violence ===\nAvoid the surroundings of football (soccer) stadiums before and after big matches, since \"barras bravas\" (hooligans) can be very violent. Ask for advice if you plan to go there or thereabouts. Very infrequently, but occasionally even in nicer tourist areas, gangs of young supporters of rival football clubs, or strikers involved in a labor dispute may brawl. If you find yourself caught in the middle of such a confrontation, just try to move out of the way, preferably behind a closed door. These youths generally do not carry lethal weapons, and the worst that is likely to happen is that someone will get hit with a rock before the police arrive to break it up.\n\n\n=== Districts of note ===\nSome areas of Lima are safer than others: Miraflores and San Isidro have large populations of well-to-do and wealthy Peruvians, not to mention large tourist groups, so they have a large police presence to protect the population. Other districts, such as La Victoria, are much more dangerous. Visitors would be well advised to stay out of these areas unless accompanied by an experienced native or visiting busy areas during daylight hours. Downtown Lima is normally well patrolled but be careful anyway. Callao (the port is a separate city) is rather rough: ask for advice before going there if you plan to. The area around the airport is generally safe and well guarded but use common sense while carrying your luggage outside the airport.\n\n\n=== Sex ===\nStaying safe for adults can also require an understanding of the sexual climate of Peru. In general Peru is a relatively conservative country in the sense of male and female roles, but at the same time Peruvians are extremely open to friendships with foreigners.  Thus, some men can find themselves suddenly the object of flirtation by attractive young Peruvian women, but then be suddenly rejected for having violated some unwritten line of conduct in, say, discussion topics. Women can find themselves the object of unwanted looks and stares, but at the same time the risk of violence and rape is probably not as high as in many other countries.\nA problem that can arise is the Peruvian concept of the pepera, found at certain night clubs or pubs. Peperas are usually attractive women aged 16\u201325 that deliberately entice foreign tourists and then spike their drinks with sleeping pills and rob them once they're unconscious. Usually peperas work in groups of two, although smaller and larger groups exist as well. Male \"peperos\" also spike the drinks of women but robbery is often accompanied by rape. Peperas in general are found in dense tourist areas, such as Parque Kennedy in Miraflores as well as the Plaza de Armas in central Lima. One locale in particular that is notorious for dangerous peperas is the Tequila Rock discoteca in Miraflores and its sister in Pueblo Libre (La Marina). In July 2013 cases of drink spiking, working with bar staff, occurred in Albazos Restaurant y Pisco Bar (Berlin 172 in Miraflores).\nAnother cultural concept worth learning is the \"brichera\" (or \"brichero\"). There are two types of bricheras: the first type are women that are genuinely looking to meet foreign men in the hopes of dating or marriage or even a quick fling. The second type are women that search for foreign men with the implicit purpose of exchanging sex for small gifts or money. This second type of brichera is risky, especially for foreigners lacking local sensibilities, since it involves prostitution. These bricheras do not use contraception reliably, and therefore pose a higher risk for transmitting STDs (sexually transmitted diseases). If you decide to have a fling, make sure to use a condom.\n\n\n=== Taxis ===\nAnother important point to be taken into consideration is that you should not pick up just any taxi, especially when you are leaving the airport. It is not unusual to hear news of taxi drivers cheating tourists by charging them S/100 or even S/200 for normal rides, which is well in excess of the maximum fare limit of S/50. Even though Peruvian taxi drivers normally increase their fares for gringos, it is not usually such a massive difference. It is most advisable to use one of the official taxi companies inside the airport with set fares to ensure your safety.\nTaxi drivers have also been known to participate in robberies, express kidnappings or serve as get away vehicles.  While the overwhelming majority of Lima's taxistas are honest hard working people trying to make a living, you should be alert if you are going to hail a taxi on the street, especially if you appear to be wealthy or a foreigner. Your safest bet is to have your hotel call a taxi for you or keep the numbers of official taxi companies (\"radio taxis\", which are marked with registered numbers) handy. Lima's tourist information centers will be willing to call one for you as well.\nUber (largest presence), Cabify, InDrive, Beat and Easy (smallest presence) ride share apps are available in Lima, and almost always cheaper than taxis, they're also safer, and with Beat/InDrive you get a recommended rate, but you can negotiate over the app as well. Most Peruvians use ride share apps, as even they don't enjoy negotiating with taxi drivers (there are no taxi-meters).\n\n\n=== Corrupt police ===\nWhile highly unlikely, some corrupt policemen might insist on seeing your passport to \u2018verify when you entered the country\u2019. Peru doesn't stamp passports anymore, so the victim shows the passport (if they are even carrying it on them) and of course, there will be no stamp from border control on the passport. The police will then threaten to take you to the police station or \u2018fine\u2019 you on the spot. They just want money, make sure you are nice but stand your ground. Ideally show a picture of your passport on your phone but don't show them your real passport.\n\n\n== Cope ==\n\n\n=== Embassies ===\nThe majority of embassies are clustered in San Isidro with some located in the adjacent Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda, La Victoria, Miraflores and Lima Districts:\n\n  Argentina, Calle las Flores 326, San Isidro, \u260f +51 1 441-44-44. \n  Australia, V\u00edctor A.

        "title": "Santiago",
        "extract": "Santiago is the capital and economic center of Chile. With its many museums, events, theaters, restaurants, bars and other entertainment and cultural opportunities, it is also the cultural center of the country. For visitors it's both the gateway to the country and a destination in its own right with an eclectic architecture, a vibrant culinary and cultural scene, surrounded by the mighty Andes welcoming skiers, trekkers and friends of wine. Its central location in the country makes it a great base for visiting other areas, and it is possible to ski in the nearby Andes and later be on the beach in the same day.\n\n\n== Districts ==\n\n \n\n\n== Understand ==\n\nSantiago is a fast-growing city in the Santiago Regi\u00f3n Metropolitana, in the central valley of Chile between the Andes mountain range to the east and the Coastal Range to the west. The metropolitan area has about 7 million inhabitants.\nFounded in 1541 as Santiago de Nueva Extremadura by the Spaniard Pedro de Valdivia, it has been the heart of the country since colonial times and has evolved to the cosmopolitan city it is today. \n\n\n=== History ===\nThe Santiago valley has been inhabited for thousands of years by different tribes. The Inca empire, and with them the Inca road network, extended here in the late 15th century. Not long after emerged the Spanish conquistadors, and on February 12, 1541, Pedro de Valdivia founded \"Santiago de Nueva Extremadura\" as the capital of the Captaincy General of Chile. During the following centuries functioned as the headquarters of the Spanish for their wars against the native Mapuche people further south, during which time the city was ruined two times by earthquakes.\nFrom the 19th century onwards, Santiago followed a similar path as many other South American cities. Independence was followed by rapid expansion and modernization and many of the city's major buildings, cultural institutions and parks were established at this time. Also the railway network to other parts of the country was greatly expanded. European immigration was from the 1930s onwards followed by immigrants from rural Chile and the city already had 3 million inhabitants by the middle of the 20th century.\nThe next major event in the city's history took place in 1973, when Marxist president Allende was ousted in a military coup. The military dictatorship that followed lasted until 1990. Today, Chile is a safe, democratic and stable country and one of the richest in Latin America.\n\n\n=== Geography ===\nSantiago sits in the middle of the Maipo river valley, at the place where it is joined by its tributary Mapocho, and the city is surrounded by mountains of various elevations, the highest of them Tupungato (6,570 m). Many of them are active volcanoes, and the soil has been covered in ash for millennia making it very fertile and high-quality grapes and other fruits are widely grown just outside the city.\nThe city sits between 400 and 540 meters above the sea level, but with many \"hill islands\" here and there including Santa Lucia, Cerro Calan and Cerro San Cristobal, the most emblematic top of the city. The Andes on the east side are noticeably higher than the Chilean Coastal Range on the west, wherefore east and west are often referred to as \"up\" or \"down\" by locals.\nThe administrative conurbation of Santiago is made up of 37 municipalities, of which the most important is Santiago Centro, where the main public institutions of the country and the old town are found. The east of the city is the financial center of the country.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nLike most of the central part in the country, Santiago has a typical Mediterranean climate. The climate is chilly and rainy in the winter, and temperatures can fall to around 0\u00b0C at night. It very rarely snows in the city itself, and during the winter it will more likely be raining with snow falling to the east up in the Andes. It gets progressively hotter towards the summer. Summers are fairly dry although you may experience some humidity at times, and temperatures can surpass 35\u00b0C. Due to the relative lack of vegetation in the region, temperatures fluctuate wildly between day and night year-round. It is not uncommon to suffer from the heat in shorts and a short-sleeved shirt during the day but require a jacket at night.\nSantiago is notorious for its poor air quality, which is due to the inversion effect in the basin and other factors. The air quality can be unhealthy in large part due to high concentrations of particulate matter (especially in the winter).\n\n\n=== Visitor information ===\n1 Sernatur (State Tourism Agency), Av Providencia 1550, \u260f +56 2 27318336, +56 2 27318337. The main visitor information office. \nInformation on Santiago from Chile Travel website\n\n\n== Get in ==\nUpon entry, all tourists are issued a tourist card good for 90 days. Take care not to lose the stamped tourist card as it is required to exit the country. If you happen to lose it you must get it reissued by the PDI (Polic\u00eda de Investigaciones) before attempting to leave the country.\n\n\n=== By plane ===\n\nSee also: Arturo Merino Ben\u00edtez International Airport\n1 Aeropuerto Internacional Comodoro Arturo Merino Ben\u00edtez (SCL  IATA, also known as Pudahuel Airport after the municipality it's in). Is the main Chilean gateway for international flights. The travel time to the city center has been drastically reduced with the construction of a tollway, the Costanera Norte.   \nAeropuerto Internacional Comodoro Arturo Merino Ben\u00edtez has flights from most continents, with major flight routes to North America, Europe, the Middle East and is the only South American airport to have flights to Oceania. The airport is also a major hub for Latin America.\nTravelers from Albania and Mexico, must pay a reciprocity fee upon entry to the country by air. This is in response to these same countries' visa fees for Chilean citizens. The one-time charge must be paid in cash (US dollars) or credit card before passing through immigration and is valid for the life of the passport. The fee for Albanians is US$30, and US$23 for Mexicans. There is no fee to enter by land. If paying by cash be aware that the bills must be in near \"perfect\" condition, no ripped bills.\nThere are taxis waiting immeditiately outside the terminal.\nThere are two public bus companies that run into town: Centropuerto and Turbus. You can purchase a one-way ticket for 2,000 pesos. Follow the signs to the bus terminal. It is a 5-minute walk from arrivals.\nThere is also the public Red bus line 555 that runs between the metro station Pajaritos and the parking space for the employees of the airport. It works with the Metro card and a ride with the bus (or bus+metro) counts as a standard ride (<= 800 pesos). The card can be bought and charged at Metro stations, but not in the bus. From the parking space runs a free shuttle bus to the terminals.\nTransvip and WeTransport offer shared and private transport to and from the airport.\nIf you are renting a car, the rental car company counters are all together to your left after clearing customs in the international terminal. There is a separate set of rental car counters before customs (so you can rent a car while waiting at the baggage claim), but they are not always staffed. After you get your contract, you have to walk outside, turn left, and walk east, then cross the street to the south to a small lot where the rental cars are kept and present your contract to the attendant on duty to obtain your rental car. When you return the vehicle, you must return to the same lot. Because the airport rental car lot is far too small, traffic jams and delays are frequent, so arrive early. At return, the attendant inspects the vehicle and fills out a return checklist form in carbon copy, then gives you one of the copies, which you bring back to the inside counter to close out your contract.\n\n\n=== By train ===\n\nTrenes Metropolitanos provides multiple commuter and interregional trains from the 2 Estaci\u00f3n Central  train station (Metro Estaci\u00f3n Central, Line 1) to the vast wine and agriculture valley to the south. The central station, designed by Gustave Eiffel, used to be the center of an extensive passenger railway network, which has been closed down just like in the rest of South America.\n\nMetrotren is a commuter rail that runs to San Fernando by way of Rancagua with five departures daily, prices up to 2,400 pesos.\nTerraSur runs to Chill\u00e1n with three departures daily. It is recommended to book ahead during the high season (Austral summer) as seats fill up quickly. Prices are up to 22,000 pesos for first class and 10,800 pesos for second class.\nExpreso Maule runs an interregional express service to the sixth and seventh regions (O'Higgins and Maule) once daily, prices up to 3,850 pesos.\n\n\n=== By car ===\nEntering Santiago by car, you'll probably find yourself on the Autopista Central (Ruta 5), the Chilean leg of the Pan-American Highway. To use this freeway you need a \"TAG\" toll transponder, or a day pass which you can buy from service stations. One-day passes are 7,000 pesos. You can also buy it after accidentally passing through it without one.\nIf you rent a car at the airport or anywhere in Santiago, the rental car company is required to include a TAG toll transponder in the vehicle and charge you for it.\n\n\n=== By bus ===\nBuses are the main mode of transportation between cities, and most cities in Chile have a bus connection to the capital. For some close, large cities, like Valparaiso or Vi\u00f1a del Mar there may be a bus departing as frequently as every 15 minutes. Prices of bus tickets vary according to demand and type of seat (regular seat, semi-bed or bed). Buses are in general clean and comfortable, but this may not always be the case with the toilets on board. There are several bus terminals in the city, the biggest being Terminal Santiago.\nThe bus ride between Santiago and Mendoza in Argentina has beautiful views and takes about eight hours, depending on the time spent at the Cristo Redentor checkpoint. The border crossing is at about 2,800 m in the Andes. Fruit, vegetables or animal products are not allowed in either direction; all luggage will get checked at the border. One-way fares are listed at around 21,000 pesos (semicama) 25,000 pesos (cama) in high season, but are often cheaper if booked in advance and in the off season. There are also buses to and from San Juan (one way fares listed at around 19,500 pesos) and Neuquen, Argentina. One-way fares to Lima are listed at around 85,000 pesos.\n\n3 Terminal Santiago (Estaci\u00f3n Central, ex Terminal Sur), Avda. Lib. Bernardo O'Higgins 3850, Alameda 3848, (Metro Universidad de Santiago [Line 1]), \u260f +56-2-23761750, +56 2 23761755. Bus companies serving international and domestic destinations are in the Terminal Santiago. In the terminal there is a food court with local fast food restaurants and a McDonald's. May be extremely overcrowded prior to and on national holiday. Not dangerous, but be beware of pickpockets and people trying to sell you stolen goods (iPods and cell phones are a common target). \n\n4 Terminal Alameda, Avda. Lib. Bernardo O'Higgins 3750 (Metro Universidad de Santiago, Metro Estaci\u00f3n Central [Line 1]), \u260f +56-2-22707425, +56 2 27762424. Turbus and Pullman operate at this private station for domestic and international departures. There is a hotel and a few convenience shops in the terminal. \n5 Terrapuerto Los H\u00e9roes, Tucapel Jim\u00e9nez 21 (Metro Los H\u00e9roes [Line 1]), \u260f +56-2-24239530, +56 2 24200099. A few kilometers east of the main terminals is the Terminal Los H\u00e9roes. Services to the north and to Mendoza. Of note here is the bus line Cruz del Sur, which is one of the few companies with regularly scheduled departures to towns in Argentine Patagonia and Punta Arenas. \n6 Terminal San Borja, San Borja 184 (Metro Estaci\u00f3n Central), \u260f +56-2-27760645. Services to the north of the country, Litoral Central and the western part of the Santiago region. \n7 Terminal Pajaritos (Metro Pajaritos). Services to Vi\u00f1a del Mar, Valpara\u00edso and the airport. \n\n\n== Get around ==\n\n\n=== Transantiago ===\nTransantiago runs the metro and main bus lines in the city. Fares on public transport can be paid only with a bip! card. Bip! cards can be bought and recharged at any metro station (1,550 pesos for the card, minimum recharge 1,000 pesos) or at a Centro bip!. They are good for both the metro and bus and allows you unlimited transfers between the two within a two hour period \u2014 you still have to swipe your card when boarding the next metro train or bus, but there is in general no deduction. In the peak period, when traveling with a ticket activated on a metro and you're transferring to a bus (or the other way around) there will be a small deduction.\nYou cannot return the card nor get a refund, think twice before adding too much money. However, you can use the card for several people, you just have to swipe for the second person as well. So, you might decide to only get one instead of two if you are traveling together. The free transfer between metro and bus for the other person does probably not work then.\nThe fare depends on when you've started your journey; tickets cost 800 pesos for trips commenced during the peak periods (07:00-09:00, 18:00-20:00), 720 pesos for shoulder periods (06:30-07:00, 09:00-18:00, 08:00-20:45) and 640 pesos for low periods (before 06:30 and after 20:45).\n\n\n==== By metro ====\nThe Santiago Metro system is the second largest in Latin America and has seven lines and 136 stations, with many holding rotating art exhibitions. The lines 1, 2 and 5 pass through the historical center and 4 and 4A mostly serve the east of the city. As it is a very popular mode for getting around, the metro can be crowded during rush hours.\nTrains run between roughly 06:00 and 23:00; each station posts the exact hours above the staircases leading down into the stations. Buses run parallel to subway lines after hours.\n\n\n==== By bus ====\nTransantiago buses are mostly modern and run around the clock on the main lines. If you know a little Spanish, you can find route information on the Transantiago website.\nOn Sundays 10:00\u201318:00, Transantiago operates a \"cultural circuit\" , where a specially-marked bus runs between major tourist and cultural destinations for the normal fare.\n\n\n=== By taxi ===\nTaxis are a relatively inexpensive and safe way to get around the city. Flag drop costs 300 pesos plus 120 pesos for every 100 meters. Official taxis are black and yellow and easily identifiable. Radiotaxis are also common and a good idea late at night. Suburban areas are sometimes served by taxis operating fixed routes and fixed rates. There are many Uber taxis, but they are not officially licensed in Chile, and Uber drivers will not want to pick you up or drop you off where either police or licensed taxis can see them. Getting to/from the airport by Uber is particularly awkward. Official taxis are a similar rate anyway.\n\n\n=== By bike ===\nSantiago has a rapidly-growing network of bike lanes and paths. Bicineta has an up to date map of bike routes.\n\n Bikesantiago. Bike sharing program with monthly and annual memberships. Must register to use the service. \n\n\n=== By tour bus ===\n   Turistik Santiago Hop on \u2013 Hop off, \u260f +56 2 28201000. 09:30\u201318:00. A red double-decker bus that passes through the main tourist attractions of the city, including the Central Market, Plaza de Armas, Bellavista, and Parque Metropolitana, among others. Pass is good for the day with departures every half hour during operating hours. 19,000 pesos. \n\n\n== See ==\nSee #Districts for listings.\n\nThe Historical Center is the place to go for historical sights. For over five centuries this has been a governmental seat, and you can find buildings of great historical significance here. One of them is the modernist colonial Palacio de la Moneda, built for minting of coins. From the mid-19th century it has also been the residence of the president until the coup of 1973 when it was bombed. The damage was repaired and it's still the residence of the president today.\nSouth of the palace is Alameda, the main drag of the city with the central university building (Casa Central de la Universidad de Chile), the San Francisco church and the Santa Lucia hill with great views of the old town. Plaza de Armas opposite the university building is the most lively area of the downtown and in addition to vendors you can often find artists, comedians and singers performing here. Nearby you can find the Metropolitan Cathedral, the Palace of the Royal Court (nowadays a museum) and the mayor's residence.\n\nGoing north from Plaza de Armas you'll come to the Mercado Central, with plenty of restaurants. East along the Mapocho river's southern bank you'll be at Parque Forestal and Museo de Bellas Artes as well as the vibrant neighborhood of Lastarria with plenty of caf\u00e9s, restaurants and art galleries.\nBellavista north of the river is a nightlife hotspot and there you can also visit the mythical home of the poet Pablo Neruda. You can also take the funicular or walk up the Cerro San Crist\u00f3bal for some of the best views of Santiago and the Maipo Valley. Southeast there is Providencia where you can find trendy shops and further away Sanhattan's skyscrapers including Gran Torre Santiago, the tallest in Latin America and second tallest in the Southern Hemisphere. Westwards there's Quinta Normal, a huge park surrounded by museums.\n\n\n== Do ==\nSee #Districts for listings.\n\nSantiago is known as a cultural hotspot. Among other things, the city is home to an impressive jazz scene, with several intimate clubs scattered throughout the city, a famous one being Club Jazz in the Nu\u00f1oa district. In the Providencia district a jazz festival takes place each January with both local and foreign bands playing. For current theater, dance, and concert listings can be found in the El Mercurio newspaper. For a broad variety of art and culture, visit one of several cultural centers around the city, featuring exhibitions, performances and workshops. At some of these you can buy local art and handicraft too (refer to the Buy section for more shopping).\nYou can also take a pleasant walk in one of Santiago's many parks. Some of these, like Cerro Santa Lucia and Parque Metropolitano offer great views over the city. If you want something more than just hiking or taking the cable car up a little hill, take on the higher \"hills\" outside the city. Contact one of the local mountaineering clubs and go on a trek to some of the highest mountains in the world outside Asia, or if you like skiing, hit the slopes of El Colorado (Chile).\n Vineyards. While you are outside downtown, Central Chile is also famous for its wines and wineries. Some noteworthy ones are Cousi\u00f1o Macul and Concha y Toro. Casablanca Wine Valley (e.g. Vi\u00f1a Emiliana) is only about 1 hour to the west of Santiago and home to the best white wine in the country. (updated Apr 2018)\n1 Vi\u00f1a Cousi\u00f1o Macul (reachable from the Quilin Metro station). (updated Apr 2018)\n2 Vi\u00f1a Concha y Toro (take a taxi from the end of Line 4 (Las Mercedes and Puente Alto station)). (updated Apr 2018)\n3 Vi\u00f1a Emiliana. (updated Apr 2018)\n\n4 Paso de Uspallata (between Chile and Argentina). Rent a car for 1 or 2 days from Santiago and go visit the wineries near Los Andes, the beautiful Uspallata Pass with Monumento del Cristo Redentor, the Aconcagua Provincial Park for some hiking, the impressive El Puente del Inca and/or even laid-back Mendoza and its vineyards. The pass road itself is gravel road and a detour from the tunnel which most people use between Chile and Argentina. The views from the pass into Chile and Argentina are breathtaking, and the drive itself is exciting (not just along the gravel road). If you rent the car at around 16:00 and start in the morning near Los Andes or even closer to the pass, it might be better due to lesser clouds in the morning. Note, the border crossing into Argentina, which is 10 km or so behind the actual border, can take 2-6 hr with cars queuing for many kilometres before the tunnel underneath the pass. Since you actually do not want to take the tunnel, you should find a way to pass the waiting cars, maybe with the help of a local border police car. The gravel road to the pass starts about 100 m before the tunnel. If you just go to the Uspallata Pass and return to Chile without entering Argentina, do not tell the customs office on the way back that you went to see the Christ statue\u2014it seems that the statue is on the Argentinian side. On the way back, you will be checked by customs for not allowed goods and food, even if you did not cross into Argentina\u2014so, best to leave everything (even the wine) in Chile before you go to the pass. US$30 per day car rental fee. (updated Apr 2018)\n\n\n== Work ==\nIn order to work legally in Chile, a working permit needs to be obtained, which can be accomplished with the sponsorship of an employer. Many people work illegally, but it is definitely best to have a permit.\n\n\n== Buy ==\nSee #Districts for listings.\nSantiago has a lot of shopping malls all around the city. In the malls you can find a variety of retail stores and Falabella, Par\u00eds and Ripley, the most famous department stores in Chile.\n\n\n=== Downtown and Providencia ===\nFor shopping in central Santiago, head to Paseo Ahumada, a section full of different shops between the main street Alameda and Plaza de Armas.\nIf you prefer buying handcrafts, the ones in the Centro Artesanal Santa Lucia are good and relatively cheap compared with other handcrafts stores. Other handcrafts centres are in Bellavista (though a bit more expensive).\nProvidencia has a large selection of shops along Avenida Providencia.\n\n\n=== East ===\n\nThe largest malls are Parque Arauco and Alto Las Condes, both have good restaurants and the former also has free music and shows. You can get to Parque Arauco from Metro Escuela Militar (Line 1) and to Alto Las Condes from Metro Los Dom\u00ednicos (Line 1); ask locals for directions if you're unsure of how to take buses.\nAlonso de C\u00f3rdova Street and Nueva Costanera Avenue are very exclusive areas where you can find high fashion and luxury stores like Louis Vuitton, Herm\u00e9s or local designers. In this area you find great restaurants and art galleries.\nSteps from Metro Los Dom\u00ednicos (Line 1) is Pueblito Los Dom\u00ednicos. It is more expensive but has a wide variety of local handcrafts and antiques, as well as a small exhibition room and a bonsai exhibition behind it. It is very pretty with an artificial stream in a colonial-looking atmosphere. Half of the people there are usually tourists during the summer, so you won't be alone!\nPlaza Nu\u00f1oa has some small shops in the plaza where you can buy books from Latin America (Neruda, Allende, Cortazar) and also handcrafts.\n\n\n=== North ===\nIf you're already kind of familiar with Santiago, you can also go to Barrio Patronato which is near the downtown area and it's easy to reach by metro (Metro Patronato, Line 2). There you'll find cheap clothes, food and products of all kinds, as well as some foreign stores (mainly Chinese, Koreans, Peruvians and from the Middle East), thus allowing you to save quite a bit of money. It would be better to go alongside a local, though, since it's easy to get lost due to the very short and slim streets and the very high quotient of visitors. Beware of pickpocketers.\n\n\n=== South ===\nSimilarly, those who want more surprises and know the basics about Santiago can go to the famous Persa Bio Bio in the Franklin area, also not too far from downtown and near to Metro Franklin (Line 2). It can be described as a giant flea market that opens every weekend and offers antiques, tools, handmade furniture, many food stores, etc. Again, it's not a place for novices: a local's presence would be desired.\n\n\n== Eat ==\nSee #Districts for listings.\n\nIn downtown and the east of the city you can find both global and domestic fast food chains. Why not opt for the latter and have a completo, the Chilean version of the hot dog with tomato, mayonnaise, sauerkraut or a italiano hot dog with tomato, avocado and mayonnaise. In addition there are small sandwich places known as \"picadas\" serving different kinds of sandwiches (some of them with huge steaks) and pies. There are also street food carts where you can find local specialties like sopaipillas (buns) stuffed with fried pumpkin and mote con huesillo, a soft drink with peaches and wheat.\nThe traditional cuisine of central Chile is centered around barbecued meat (beef or pork) with tomatoes, potatoes or corn. Local specialties include cazuela (a soup), porotos con riendas (beans with pasta), porotos granados (a vegetarian bean stew), charquic\u00e1n (stew of beef and potatoes, topped with an egg), pastel de choclo (corn pie) and as we're in southern South America \u2014 asado (barbecued meat). Seafood is not as common in Santiago as you might expect, though if you want some, the restaurants at the central market are the place to go.\nYou can get vegetarian and vegan food but it will likely be some version of pizza, pasta, and burgers.\n\n\n== Drink ==\nSee #Districts for listings.\nNightlife choices vary widely across the city and their location usually reflects their price and style.\n\nBarrio Bellavista and Barrio Brasil are popular spots close to downtown. The Bohemian Bellavista can be reached by Metro to Baquedano, or by bus to Plaza Italia. Cross the bridge will bring you to Pio Nono, which probably has highest density of bars, pubs, and clubs in Chile, including some LGBT places. By law, everything closes down at 05:00, though you may be able to join people for afterparties elsewhere.\nBarrio Lastarria has more sophisticated and relaxed bars, pubs, caf\u00e9s, many of which have an interesting history. It's also a district for fine dining.\nThe historic center likewise has many traditional places to have a drink, some of which have retained an ambience from the early 20th century. One of them is La Piojera, with its signature terremoto (earthquake) drink with wine, Fernet and pineapple ice cream.\nPlaza San Enrique is a park in Lo Barnechea (at the far northeast of the city) which is surrounded by nightclubs. The most popular one is Sala Murano (it can get very crowded!) People who attend are mostly aged 18-25 and it is one of the safest places to party. Most people there are from upper-middle to high class, so it is more expensive than other neighbourhoods. Typically, women get in for free, while men pay around 3,000-5,000 pesos. You can get there by buses, but though buses do pass later on, you might have to wait up to an hour for it.\nPlaza \u00d1u\u00f1oa is a district east of the central area and is another popular spot nightlife spot.\nVitacura is pretty far east (towards the Andes). It is composed of bars and some places where you can dance. The places are nice and it can be fun to go. It is more expensive that other areas of Santiago and frequented by people that live in the eastern (wealthier) side of the city. Although you can get there by bus, it will be hard to leave on anything but a taxi since buses don't run late.\n\n\n== Sleep ==\nSee #Districts for listings.\n\nAll types of accommodation, from top class hotels to backpacker hostels are available. As a general rule, lodging gets more luxurious and expensive the further east you travel.\nClassic, mid-range hotels can be found downtown, and in the nearby residential areas such as Barrio Brasil you'll find more affordable accommodation like youth hostels. Lastarria just east of downtown features small boutique hotels. In the eastern part of the city you can find hotels of international luxury chains and apartment hotels, catering to those who attend business meetings, conferences or trade shows. Still further east, outside the city and up the mountains there are the upscale ski resorts.\n\n\n== Stay safe ==\nSantiago is infamous for its smog, which is worse during the winter (May\u2013September). The locals welcome the rain which falls during winters as it cleans the air. Be sure to carry bottled water with you during the summer. Be prepared for sauna-heat on the metro during summer.\n\n\n=== When getting around ===\nBy South American standards Santiago is a safe city, but visitors should be aware of pickpocketing and other petty crimes (Chileans derogatorily refer to the pickpockets as \"lanzas\", from the verb \"lanzar\", \"to throw upon\" in English). Avoid parks at night and don't wear expensive looking jewelry or watches even during the day, unless you are in Las Condes or Vitacura. If you're alone, avoid large crowds of people, especially downtown.\nIf you happen to have bad luck and get robbed, do as you're told by the criminal and if you don't understand Spanish, give away the wallet. Not doing so can provoke an attack until you give away your wallet. Don't try to stand up to them and once again: do as you're told.\nKeep your camera concealed, use it to take a photo and then hide it while not using it. If you're getting robbed and the criminal has spotted the camera expect to give it away too if you want to stay out of trouble.\nIf someone approaches you on the streets and promises to get you better chances at changing your dollars or euros into Chilean pesos, never accept their deals. They're con-people who take advantage of foreigners not knowing the details about currency and confuse them with big words to take their cash away. Only change your money in legal currency exchange centers, which may take more time but are much more trustworthy. There's one in the airport, but they are also easy to find in the downtown and financial areas, or in the malls.\nOverall, Santiago is very safe if you travel by car.\nThe metro is regarded as safer for travelling amongst the locals, even though security has increased in the buses after the introduction of TranSantiago. But some locals still prefer using the metro especially when it gets darker, since almost all the stations have guards. Don't expect the staff to speak much English. In peak hours the metro runs really full so try to keep your backpack on the front and belongings in front pockets.\n\n\n=== Dangerous areas ===\nThere are some neighborhoods/barrios that should be avoided. The few carabineros and locals that speak English will know which areas are to be avoided since some of them can actually be accessed by metro. Some people at local Starbucks are more likely to speak English.\nIf you see fewer tall buildings and more houses with locked windows and entrances, then turn back. The changes happen very slowly, unlike some other Latin American cities, so you'd have to travel quite a lot from a wealthy safe neighbourhood to a dangerous ghetto. Avoid especially La Legua (not to be confused with La Ligua in the V Regi\u00f3n) which is famed in Chile for its high crime rates. Single police cars won't even enter the area.\nTry staying away from the following comunas: Lo Espejo, La Pintana, Puente Alto (especially the Plaza de Armas), La Cisterna, San Joaqu\u00edn, El Bosque (not to be confused with the avenue and neighbourhood around Metro El Golf, which is in Las Condes), San Ram\u00f3n, Pedro Aguirre Cerda and La Granja unless you know exactly where you're going. Though these places are not completely unsafe for the most part, they can have a few unsafe spots and don't have much touristic significance.\nThe safest comunas are Providencia, Vitacura and Las Condes. All of them have lots of local security guards, besides Carabineros, and locals are more likely to speak English, especially young people. They are not completely safe, though: petty theft still takes place, so keep your eyes open in the streets. Lo Barnechea can be tricky as it is the only comuna that has both extremely wealthy and extremely poor neighbourhoods ever since Pinochet's dictatorship; \"La Dehesa\" is wealthy and safe, \"Cerro Dieciocho\" is as dangerous as La Legua.\n\n\n=== Football ===\n\nIf you are going to see a football match, be careful with the \"barras bravas\" who are the most fanatic but also dangerous fans. They are often involved in troubles with the police both inside the stadium and outside. Avoid buying tickets in the sections where the bravas dominate, which are often behind the goals. The middle section is the safest but if you have a friend who wants to support Colo-Colo and another Universidad de Chile for example, avoid showing it. Even if the middle section is safe, showing different shirts can cause you trouble. Either go with the same shirts or dress neutral. Other football matches not being the \"Supercl\u00e1sico\" between Universidad de Chile against Colo-Colo should be pretty safe.\nWalking to the stadium you will find people begging for some pesos so they can see the match. Avoid giving them if you want to stay out of trouble.\nThe barrio around the Estadio Nacional is normally peaceful, but you have to walk purposefully and keep your eyes on other people when it's crowded. It's better to take a taxi to the arena, or a rental car if you can find a place to park it.\n\n\n=== Other ===\nNever join a protest, because it can end badly. If you are caught in one, don't hesitate to hide in a restaurant, shop or something similar.\nChilean police (carabineros) are in general trustworthy, at least in comparison to other Latin American countries. Although you can hardly find one who can speak English, they will try to answer your questions, solve your problems or give you directions. Never attempt to bribe a police officer; Chile has the least corrupt police force of Latin America.\nHowever remember that the Chilean police is a militarized police. Therefore the police special forces can be violent or unreasonable if they think you have done or will do something illegal or inappropriate, so be careful.\n\n\n== Connect ==\nIf you wish to mail a letter or postcard, the largest post office is the Correo Central on the north side of Plaza de Armas, a Neoclassical building with French influences. There are several smaller post offices around the city, often close to the larger avenues.\nHowever, Chilean mail has become infamous for not getting things delivered or mailmen opening the letters trying to find money or any valuable items (mostly on mail coming from abroad).\nThe largest and most trustworthy private mail company is Chilexpress, which has agencies in almost all mid-sized cities. Prices are a bit higher, though.\n\n\n== Cope ==\n\n\n=== Embassies ===\n  Australia, Isidora Goyenechea 3621, 12F, Las Condes, \u260f +56 2 25503500, fax: +56 2 23315960, immigration.santiago@dfat.gov.au. \n  Canada, Nueva Tajamar 481 - Piso 12, Torre Norte, Edificio World Trade Center, \u260f +56 2 26523800, fax: +56 2 26523912, stago@international.gc.ca. \n  China, Pedro de Valdivia 550, Providencia, \u260f +56 2 22339880, fax: +56 2-2341129, embajadachina@entelchile.net. \n  Czech Republic, Av.

The skiing season is from May to August.\n\nSki resorts northeast of Santiago reachable by car within an hour and a half include Farellones, Valle Nevado, La Parva and El Colorado.\nThe ski resorts of Portillo and Valle Nevado are two to three hours away on the road to Mendoza.\nRancagua is 85 km to the south and has some thermal springs and hiking opportunities nearby.\nCaj\u00f3n del Maipo, beautiful in spring, some 75 km south east of Santiago, day trip. Some nice places for lunch and tea; many of them only open on weekends.\nSierras de Bellavista (150 km south of Santiago) is a wonderful little mountain village, especially after a rainy day. Alpine scenery.\nOther nearby nature reserves include Monumento Natural El Morado, Reserva Nacional R\u00edo Clarillo and Santuario de la Naturaleza Yerba Loca\nThe villages and towns in the surrounding Maipo valley is also a great place for seeing the Chilean way of life, buying handicrafts, tasting wine and savoring local cuisine.\n\n\n=== The coast ===\nThe Pacific Ocean is less than 100 km from Santiago, and easily accessible.\n\nVina del Mar, 90 minutes away is the beach capital of the country, and it also has nice parks, gardens, restaurants, cafes and casinos.\nValpara\u00edso, next to Vina del Mar is one of the largest ports on the Pacific, but certainly not a dirty industrial behemoth. It's also a famous for its world heritage listed and very Bohemian old town on the mountain sides.\nIsla Negra, a village on the coast, south of Valpara\u00edso. The main and most beloved house of Pablo Neruda is there. This is probably the most interesting of his three houses to visit and the best conserved as it is the only one that the military didn't sack during the coup d'\u00e9tat in 1973. To get there, you can take the Pullman bus (3,700 pesos, 2 hr) from Terminal Alameda (Metro Universidad de Santiago). You can also take the Turbus bus to San Antonio (1,000-2,000 pesos, 1\u00bd hr) from Alameda as well, and then take a local bus in front of \"laPolar\" (450 pesos, 30 min) that goes along the beautiful coast. Tours of the house cost 3,000 pesos and last a half an hour. Then you can go to the beach."

        "title": "Marrakech",
        "extract": "Marrakech (Arabic: \u0645\u0631\u0627\u0643\u0634, Berber: \u2d30\u2d4e\u2d53\u2d54\u2d30\u2d3d\u2d53\u2d5b), also spelt Marrakesh, is one of the imperial cities of Morocco. Marrakech is the main tourist destination in Morocco. The city is divided into two parts: the Medina, the historical city, and the new European modern district called Gueliz or Ville Nouvelle. The Medina is full of intertwining narrow passageways and local shops full of character; it also contains the large square Djemaa El-Fna, where many hotels are located and tourists, locals and vendors congregate. In contrast, Gueliz plays host to modern restaurants, fast food chains and big brand stores.\n\n\n== Understand ==\n\nThe name Marrakech originates from the Amazigh (Berber) words mur (n) wakush, which means \"Land of God\". It is the third largest city in Morocco after Casablanca and Rabat, and lies near the foothills of the snow-capped Atlas Mountains and a few hours away from the foot of the Sahara Desert. Its location and contrasting landscape has made it an enviable destination in Morocco.\nAs the country's main tourist destination, Marrakech is where many Moroccans try to become rich fast by ripping off tourists. This mentality is so widespread that even Moroccans are now ripped off whenever possible so that they call the city \"Marrakech, Arnakech\" \u2013 which rhymes in French and translates to \"Marrakech, Scam\" (see Touts and scams below).\nFor further information, you may also visit the  1 Marrakech Tourist Information (at a small square at the intersection of Avenue Mohammed V and Rue de Yugoslavie). \n\n\n== Get in ==\n\n\n=== By plane ===\nMarrakech has an international airport with direct scheduled flights from many major European centres, including flights operated by a number of low cost carriers. Connections via Casablanca (45-min flight) are also possible.\n\n1 Marrakech-Menara Airport (RAK  IATA), \u260f +212 4444 7910.   \nMarrakech-Menara Airport has two terminals housed in one complex. Both terminals have money exchange offices, and there is an ATM in the arrivals hall of Terminal 2. On ATMs, check for the Maestro, Cirrus or Plus logos to be sure that the machine accepts foreign credit cards. Some ATMs work only in French. If your card is taken at the ATM, tell airport security and they can help you get it back. There are no potable water dispensers after the security check and the small shops only see overpriced 0.5-L water bottles.  However the tap water from the WC only tastes slightly of chlorine and is drinkable for tourists.  Gift shops, cafes and restaurants located after security (airside) usually display prices in euros only, but many will take Moroccan Dirhams in cash too, at their own exchange rate.\nFor some airlines, you can only use the smartphone or mobile app for check-in but have to arrive at the airport with a print-out of your ticket. You also need to queue at the check-in counter before entering the security check (even if you do not have drop-off luggage), to get your tickets stamped by the airline, so better arrive earlier than usual.\n\nEasyjet \u2014 flights from Manchester, Stansted and Gatwick Airport (and also from Madrid, from Lyon, Amsterdam and from Basel)\nRyanair \u2014 direct flights from Oporto (Portugal), London Luton, and London Stansted, and also from Hahn (Germany), Berlin (Germany), Alicante, Madrid and Reus (Spain), Girona (Spain), Eindhoven (the Netherlands), Bergamo (Italy) (Spain), and Dublin (Ireland)\nBritish Airways \u2014 from London Gatwick\nTUIfly \u2014 flights from Cologne and several other European destinations.\nTransavia \u2014 a low-cost airline from Air France-KLM group flying to Marrakech from several cities in Europe, including Paris\nNorwegian \u2014 direct flights from Copenhagen, Oslo and Stockholm.\nIberia \u2014 two non stop flights from Madrid.\nTAP Portugal \u2014 offers direct flights from Lisbon\nDomestic flights are operated by Royal Air Maroc, with flights from Agadir, Casablanca (daily), Fez (daily), Ouarzazate, Al Hoceima, and Tangier.\n\n\n==== Ground transport ====\n\nThe airport is about 9 km south-west of the city center (Medina), and 6.6 km from the Djemaa El-Fna square.\nThe L19 airport shuttle bus is 30 dirham one way, 50 dirham return (as of 2024). It is a great way to go from the airport to the Medina area. The 2 bus 19 departure stop is right out of the terminal (exit the arrivals hall at Terminal 2, to your left you will see the parking area, walk into it and continue across all the taxis, at the end, close to the exit, there's an empty area with a black BUS sign without signs or maps, nor a place to sit or shadow.) The bus leaves the airport every 30 minutes between 06:00 and 23:30. This bus line passes Jeema El Fna, the main bus station and it only has a couple of stops along the way, most notably the Menara Mall. The whole trip takes 15\u201320 minutes. You can see the whole route and departure times in Google Maps. Beware, some taxi drivers will approach and try to convince you to go with them, sometimes even resorting to lies (\"The bus is not running today\" or \"It comes only once an hour\") \u2013 don't listen to them.\nYou can also catch city bus #11 or city bus #12 which run from different suburbs, meet at the airport and continue to the long distance bus station at Bab Doukkala, stopping also at Jeema El Fna. They stop on Avenue Gnassa - the main road near the airport, 500 m from the terminal. This is an option only for people with convenient luggage, but it is the cheapest one - the buses cost 4 dirham, like all local buses. The driver can give change.\nBy petit taxi, the city center is a 10\u201315 min ride away. Prices directly from the airport are fixed, insanely inflated and displayed prominently just outside the airport (just like at every airport in Morocco). Walking the 200 m across the parking lot to the road and hailing a taxi there will get you a much, much better price per vehicle (about 60 dirham compared to the airport's 200 dirham). Apps like InDrive can hail unofficial taxis for slightly less, payable with cash.\nMany hotels and riads offer a shuttle service for about \u20ac15 per person. The advantage is that you avoid the hassle, and they will lead you all the way to you lodging, even if the car cannot drive there. However, you might have to wait a while for all your fellow passengers to get out of the airport.\nSeveral international rental car companies are based at the airport as well.\nIf you do not have too much luggage then it is possible to walk from the airport to the Medina even though it would take you from an hour and half to two hours. There is a footpath alongside the road all the way and the minaret of the Koutoubia mosque provides an excellent landmark to head towards. If you have enough time you can break the trip with a visit to the Menara gardens, which are between the airport and the city.\n\n\n=== By train ===\n3 Train station, Avenue Hassan II (Gu\u00e9liz district), \u260f +212 447768. For train times and schedules, check out the  Moroccan Railway website. (updated Jan 2018)\nTrains from Casablanca (2nd class 84 dirham, 1st class 150 dirham, 3 hr), Rabat and Tangier connect with most domestic rail destinations in the country, with Marrakech as the southernmost stop. Trains run regularly between Marrakech and Casablanca (including the International Airport). They arrive around every two hours and regularly from other destinations like Rabat. Every day there are 8 direct 7 hr trains to Fez via Casablanca Voyageurs station and another two direct connections to Tangier.\nFrom Tangier it's about a 10-hr journey. You can travel either by day train or night train.  During the daytime, you will need to change trains for a connection halfway through the journey creating a welcome break for about 30 min. The night trains which leaves for Marrakech from Tangier travels straight through to Marrakech without the need for a connection. The night trains do have sleeper cars on board, though you will need to pay extra for these if you want a bed (around 350 dirham).  If you're planning to go cheap and take the night train on the regular seats in second class (and planning to sleep), you'll be interrupted by movement of passengers and a few times by the ticket conductors throughout the night. It's a great way to travel but don't plan on sleeping on the train, especially if you are travelling alone.\nThere is no train line further south than Marrakech in Morocco; if you want to head south, to the desert, Atlas Mountains, Agadir or Essaouira on the coast, you'll have to get a bus, rental car or grand taxi.\nMoroccan trains do not have restaurant cars. A snack trolley makes the rounds with sandwiches, soft drinks and coffee, but bringing some food for the journey isn't a bad idea. Stops in Casablanca and Rabat usually are long enough to grab a bite in the station en route.\nSome taxi drivers will offer their services in the train station or just in front of it. They usually don't use their meter and ask for at least 50 dirham to Djemaa El-Fna. Ignore them and hail one on the main road. The metered fair to Djemaa El-Fna is about 12 dirham, if you want to avoid any discussions just offer 20 dirham upfront and take the first taxi that accepts this offer.\n\n\n=== By bus ===\n4 Gare Routi\u00e8re (ALSA) (very central next to the medina, and more convenient than CTM, near Bab Doukkala, a 20-min walk (15-20 dirham by petit taxi) from Djemaa El-Fna). Most ALSA (local destination bus company) and private bus lines depart and arrive at this bus station. Supratours (?) and Eurolines buses operate from here. It's the place to take the buses from the small companies, that go directly to small destinations. Buy your ticket inside of the terminal at the according counter. There you will also find the proper prices, outside they will just quote you arbitrary prices or tell you it is more expensive because of AC. (updated Apr 2019)\n5 Gare Voyageurs (CTM Bus Station) (one block south from the Supratours station next to the train station). CTM operates a separate bus station. You can buy the tickets in advance. The CTM's offices are better than at the Gare Routi\u00e8re, and there are no people trying to push you to their bus company. The office and station on Zerktouni street does not exist anymore. CTM has also an office at the long distance bus station (see above) if you just want to buy your tickets in advance or check the schedule.A taxi ride from the CTM station to the main square is, if metered, about 12 dirham. The taxis waiting in front of the station are operated by a gang of dishonest drivers who will charge up to 100 dirham. One can just ignore their pushy boss and loudly offer 20 dirham - usually someone will accept or walk 50 m up or down the road and hail in taxi. (updated Apr 2019)\n6 Jardin Sidi Mimoun. Jump off point for minibuses to Asni, Imlil, Ourika Valley and the High Atlas in general. (updated May 2019)\nThere are many long distance bus companies operating within Morocco which serve Marrakech and other cities.\nThe bus companies mostly used by tourists are CTM, Pullman du sud and Supratours. Other companies do exist, though these three companies are usually the safest options, but mostly not the cheapest ones.\nThe long distance bus station, CTM and private bus companies travel to destinations such as Agadir (regular, 3 hr, 80 / 100 dirham local/CTM), Safi, Casablanca (regular, 4 hr, 80-95 dirham), El Jadida, Essaouira (regular, 3 hr, 55 / 80 dirham local/CTM), Fez, Meknes, Ouarzazate (regular, 3-3.5 hr, 80 dirham), Rabat, and Taroudant. Taxi touts will often gather in the bus station to convince you that a bus to your destination is 'full' and to steer you into a grand taxi, and will attempt to sell you goods as your taxi is prepared. This can be difficult if there is nobody manning the ticket desks, and the best option is to walk out of the station to the coaches - a ticket can usually be purchased from a conductor on board.\nFor trips to Meknes (6 hr, ca 120 dirham), while seemingly shorter on the map, the mountain route via Beni Mellal takes at least 2 hr more than on the highway via Rabat and Casablanca\u200b, going there by train (6\u00bd hr, 174 dirham) is the most comfortable option, although buses might be slightly quicker.\n\n\n== Get around ==\n\nOnce in the medina, everything can be seen on foot, though you'll be doing a lot of walking.  Many tourist destinations are signposted by brown, red or green signs affixed to posts or to buildings.  Bear in mind that many of these signs don't take the direct route, and some seem to deliberately send tourists via various markets or other places money may be spent.\n\nFor exploring more of the city, buses and petits taxis are plentiful.\n\n\n=== By bus ===\nAlsa run the city buses and have maps, fares and a frequency guide on their web page.\nAlmost all buses stop at Djemaa El-Fna (the bus stop for Djemaa El-Fna is called Terminus Arset El Bilk, and it is marked on Google Maps) and Place Youssef Ben Tachfine and fares range from 2\u20135 dirham depending on the distance. Important municipal bus lines are:\n\nNo 1 - Towards Gueliz\nNo 8 - Stops at the central train station, and bus station (Gare Routiere Voyageurs Marrakech)\nNo 10 - Stops at the long distance bus station\nNo 11 - Will drop you off at the gardens of Menara\nNo 18 - Outside of Airport to Djemaa el-Fna.\nNo 19 - Airport express to Djemaa el-Fna (return for 30 dirham)\nBus No 19 leaves Djemaa el-Fna every half an hour, from 05:15 to 21:15. The trip to the airport takes about 25 minutes.\nThere is an open-topped City Sightseeing bus that will take you around the outskirts of the city, with commentary provided via headphones (supplied with your ticket) in any of 8 different languages. The best place to catch it is from the coach stops by Square de Foucauld. Tickets cost 145 dirham each and are valid for 24 hours from the time of issue, no matter how many times you get on or off.  You can get a 48-hour ticket for very little extra and as there are two distinct tours, this can be a good deal. Check the timetable carefully, as the buses can stop running earlier than you might think.\n\n\n=== By caleche ===\nAn alternative and romantic way to travel is by caleche, a small horse-drawn carriage. They can be hired at Square de Foucauld (the small park to the south of Djemaa El-Fna). It's wise to agree on a price before setting off. As a guide price, you should pay around 80 dirham per hour, per carriage.\n\n\n=== By taxi ===\nYou should always ask to use the meter (compteur in French); otherwise, you are just contributing to a culture of ripping off people. However, in the vast majority of cases, the drivers will refuse to take you if you insist on using the meter.  Even locals often have troubles with drivers in Marrakesh, that's how it is.  Even if you use the meter, the driver may try and charge extra for bags, or be lacking change in order to get a larger fare.\nYour only option to completely avoid this is using the buses which serve most destinations of interest (see above). If you accept that you have to pay a small penalty fee for being a tourist, offer 50% more than the metered ride would cost upfront (see below).\nFor petit taxi, the maximum number of passengers is three (plus the driver), i.e. one fare applies to a single person, or a group two or three people.\n\nThe meter starts from 1.70 dirham before 20:00 and 2.40 dirham after 20:00; there's no need to negotiate the price. Basically they have to use the meter even if it is midnight.\nThe minimum charge is 7 dirham before 20:00 and after will be 10 dirham.\n20 dirham is a good price for a 10-minute ride and if offered upfront will usually be accepted. If not, kindly refuse and simply take the next taxi.\nFor grand taxis (regular Mercedes taxis) there are no meters. Typically the set rate from Marrakech Airport to the Medina or Djemaa El-Fna (Main square) is 150 dirham. There also appears to be no limit to the number of people they'll attempt to squeeze in! Outside of the airport if you are a group of more than three, the maximum for a petit taxi, then do negotiate you fee before you enter the grand taxi.\n\n\n== See ==\n\nThere is much to see and do in Marrakech. An entire day can be dedicated to wandering around all the different souks, seeking out the best bargains. The city also offers several historical and architectural sites as well as some interesting museums.\n\n1 Medina. The Medina is the old city quarter located within the sandstone city walls that give Marrakech the nickname the Red City. As an ancient hub, it contains a maze of narrow streets and outdoor marketplaces. (updated Dec 2024)\n2 Djemaa El-Fna. The highlight of any Marrakech night. Musicians, dancers, and story tellers pack this square at the heart of the medina, filling it with a cacophony of drum beats and excited shouts. Scores of stalls sell a wide array of Moroccan fare (see the Eat section) and you will almost certainly be accosted by women wanting to give you a henna tattoo. Enjoy the various shows, but be prepared to give some dirham to watch or take photos. By day it is largely filled with snake charmers and people with monkeys, as well as some of the more common stalls.   (updated Nov 2019)\n3 The Souks (suuqs). Markets of Marrakech, just adjacent to Place Djemaa El-Fna, are where you can buy almost anything, from spices to shoes, jellabas to kaftans, and tea pots to tagines. Undoubtedly, being a foreigner means you will end up paying higher prices than a native would, but be sure to bargain nonetheless. If you happen to run out of dirham, you will also find plenty of people in the souks who will eagerly exchange your dollars or euros (though a fair rate here is less likely than at an official exchange). All that said, the sellers here are much less aggressive than, say, Egypt, so have fun! (updated Jan 2018)\n4 Koutoubia Mosque (right besides Djemaa El-Fna). Named after the booksellers market that used to be located here. It is said that the minaret of the Koutoubia mosque is to Marrakech as the Eiffel Tower is to Paris. The minaret is visible from Gueliz which is connected to the Medina by Avenue Mohammed V. At night, the mosque is beautifully lit. It was completed under the reign of the Berber Almohad Caliph Yaqub al-Mansur (1184 to 1199), and has inspired other buildings such as the Giralda of Seville and the Hassan Tower of Rabat. Non-Muslims are not allowed inside.   (updated Jan 2018)\n5 Tanneries. Visiting the tanneries can be an interesting experience. Even if some people tell you the area is only for locals, it is possible to visit the Tanneries without paying a youngster. After finding a tannery, ask one of the workers if you can visit it and take pictures \n6 Saadian Tombs. The tombs were built in the 16th century as the dynastic necropolis of the Saadian dynasty at the height of its power. After the dynasty's decline, the cemetery was progressively forgotten and its entrance walled off, until they were rediscovered and restored in the early 20th century. Unlike the El Badi Palace, they are very well preserved and an excellent showcase of the best architecture from this era. Inside you will find an overload of zellij (Moroccan mosaic tiles), painted wood, and carved stucco, all set within an enclosed garden. The most ornate chamber, accessible through a small opening, is the Chamber of the Twelve Columns, where Ahmad al-Mansur, the most powerful Saadian sultan, is buried. The site is small and compact, so it does not take a lot of time to explore. Also, there are no explanatory signs, so you should hire a guide or consult a guidebook to explain you what you're seeing to get the most out of your visit. 70 dirham.   (updated Jan 2018)\n7 Moroccan Culinary Arts Museum (Mus\u00e9e d'art culinaire Marocain), Rue Riad Zitoun el Jdid. If you are interested in food and eating culture, you will enjoy this museum. Audiovisual information about the rich culinary culture of Marocco, its ingredients, techniques and traditions. You can also touch and smell many things. They also sport a very well equipped cooking school. (updated Mar 2023)\n8 Majorelle Gardens (Jardin Majorelle), Rue Yves Saint Laurent (In Gueliz), \u260f +212 5 24 31 30 47, info@jardinmajorelle.com. Oct-Apr: 08:00-17:30, May-Sep: 08:00-18:00, Ramadan: 09:00-17:00. It provides an excellent respite from the hustle and bustle of the city streets, if not crowded by tourists as it sometimes is. The park was designed by the artist Jacques Majorelle in the 1920s and 1930s. Since 1980 the garden has been owned by Yves Saint-Laurent and Pierre Berg\u00e9. It boasts a collection of plants from around the globe, including what seems like every cactus species on the planet. Get here early to avoid the crowds. Inside the gardens is also the Berber Museum, which shows a slightly bigger and more modern presentation than the Dar Si Sa\u00efd. Advance bookings must be made online, it is not possible to buy a ticket at the site. 120 dirham, 30 dirham extra for the Berber Museum.   (updated Jan 2025)\n9 Yves Saint Laurent Museum, Rue Yves St Laurent (next door to Majorelle Gardens), \u260f +212 5242-98686. Th-Tu 10:00 - 18:00. Advance bookings must be made online, it is not possible to buy a ticket at the site. 120 dirham, combination ticket with Majorelle Gardens and Berber Museum 180 dirham, queues are far shorter here than at the gardens to buy tickets though you have to buy either a YSL Museum ticket or combination ticket.   (updated Jan 2025)\n10 Dar Si Sa\u00efd Museum (on Rue Riad Zitoun Jdid, is a museum 5 mins away from Djemaa El-Fna.). 10:00\u201318:00. Museum set in an old palace with beautiful gardens. While somewhat run-down, it is worth seeing and houses many different artifacts from Morocco through the ages, such as wood carvings, musical instruments, and weapons. It is dedicated to the Moroccan craft industry of wood, gathering a very beautiful collection of popular art: carpets, clothing, pottery and ceramics. All these objects are regional, coming from Marrakech and all the south, especially from Tensift, High Atlas, Soussthe, Anti Atlas, Bani, and Tafilal. Locals: adults 10 dirham, children below 12 3 dirham; tourists: adults 30 dirham. (updated Nov 2019)\n11 Ben Youssef Madrasa, Kaat Benahid. 09:00-18:00, closed for religious holidays. One of the largest madrassas in North Africa. It is a school attached to the Ben Youssef Mosque and is home to beautiful art and architecture. Build ca 1570. 50 dirham.   (updated Jan 2018)\n12 El Bahia Palace, contact@palais-bahia.com. 09:00\u201317:00. An ornate and beautiful palace, built at the end of the 19th century for grand viziers of the sultan. Popular with guided tours and stray cats. The palace is well worth a visit and gives a great impression of what it must have been like to be a 19th-century nobleman in Morocco. There is a nice garden with banana flowers, tranquil courtyards, and other lovely plants. Attention must be given in finding the entrance. The entrance is located on Riad Zitoun el Jdid, follow this listings GPS. To take photos without tour groups in them visit when it opens at 09:00 or toward the end of the day. Locals: adults 10 dirham, children below 12 3 dirham; tourists: adults 100 dirham.   (updated Nov 2019)\n13 El Badi Palace, Ksibat Nhass. 09:00-17:00. A palace now in ruins and inhabited by storks and stray cats. There are some underground passageways to explore with exhibitions within them. Note that most explanatory text is only in Arabic and French. Newer exhibitions have text in English as well but those are still the minority. The view from the terrace is majestic. The palace was built by Sultan Ahmad al-Mansur to celebrate the Saadian victory against the Portuguese army in 1578 in the Battle of the Three Kings. Its valuable materials were looted by later sultans, some of them reused in other monuments throughout Morocco. A richly-decorated wooden minbar (preaching pulpit) from the 12th century, formerly belonging to the Koutoubia Mosque, is on display in one room with some explanations. Also hosts the Marrakech Museum for Photography and Visual Arts (abbreviated MMP+), a small museum which however showcases great pieces of visual art. 70 dirham.   (updated Nov 2019)\n14 The Menara gardens (west of the city in walking distance). 09:00-17:00. A mixture of orchards and olive groves surrounding the water reservoir with the central pavilion which is a popular sight on tourist postcards. Not a decorative garden, and now quite run down. The pavilion was built during the 16th-century Saadi dynasty, and renovated in 1869. It has a small cafe, but it is not open all hours. There are no toilets open when the cafe is closed. Free admission.   (updated Jan 2018)\n15 Jewish Cemetery, Avenue Taoulat El Miara (adjacent to the mellah, within the medina). 09:00-17:00. The largest Jewish cemetery in Morocco, characterized by white-washed tombs and sandy graves. The men selling tickets are full of interesting information about the cemetery but you have to ask. 10 dirham. (updated Nov 2019)\n16 Slat Al Azama Synagogue. 09:00-19:00 (closed Sa). Synagogue which is not only a place of worship with a beautiful open courtyard, but also includes interesting displays about Judaism's varied history in Morocco, including photos of Jews in the Berber Mountains. 10 dirham.   (updated Nov 2019)\n17 Marrakech Museum, \u260f +212 24 44 18 93. 09:00-18:30. It's housed in the Dar Menebhi Palace, constructed at the end of the 19th century. 50 dirham.   (updated Jan 2018)\n18 Mus\u00e9e de la Palmeraie, Dar Tounsi, Route de F\u00e8s (in the south of the Palmeraie, it is quite off the main tourist paths, expect to travel at about an hour per direction; you must get a taxi or bus 17 towards Palmeraie (which does not run often); the route with the museum is off to the left side of the road, the crossroads just before the Atacadao supermarket; you have to head follow the road for about 500 m, there are also signs), \u260f +212-661 09 53 52, museepalmeraie@gmail.com. 09:00-18:00?. In old agricultural buildings in the Palmeraie, made out of rammed earth. The architecture itself is interesting if you haven't seen it. It offers a small collection of contemporary art, with a room dedicated to Moroccan artists (also famous ones), the international ones are rather not top-notch. The gardens are nicely made and are good place to relax in quit. 40 dirham. (updated Mar 2016)\n19 Musee Farid Belkahia, Dar Tounsi, Route de F\u00e8s (at the seat of the Fondation Farid Belkahia, which is off Route de F\u00e8s, Dar Tounsi, walking past Mus\u00e9e de la Palmeraie for further 500 m-1 km), museepalmeraie@gmail.com.

(updated Jan 2018)\n21 Maison de la Photographie, 46, Rue souk Ahal F\u00e8s (200 m behind Ben Youssef Medersa - Koranic School). A little photography museum, it has one of the highest roof terraces in the Medina. 50 dirham. (updated Dec 2019)\n22 Ali Ben Youssef Mosque. The first mosque in Marrakesh was erected at this place by the Almoravid emir Yusuf ibn Tashfin in the 1070s. However, it was almost completely rebuilt in early 19th century by the Alaouite sultan Suleiman, with hardly any trace left of its original Almoravid or Almohad design. Non-Muslims are not allowed to enter it.   (updated Jan 2018)\n23 Agdal Gardens. It consists of groves of orange, lemon, fig, apricot and pomegranate trees in rectangular plots, linked by olive-lined walkways. Together with the medina of Marrakech and the Menara Gardens, the Agdal Gardens were listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site in 1985. 70 dirham for foreign adults.   (updated Jan 2018)\n24 Almoravid Koubba. A very small but intricate domed pavilion, known for being the only surviving example of Almoravid religious architecture (early 12th century) in Marrakech. Located across the street from the Ben Youssef Mosque, it is believed to have been an annex of the former Almoravid mosque. It was excavated in the 20th century after being half-buried for centuries. The pavilion's exterior can be easily seen from the street, so paying for entry just lets you see its interior. 50 dirham. (updated Mar 2023)\n\n\n=== Day trips ===\n Jbilets Geological Site.

Horse show, acrobats on Arabian horses firing rifles in the air, horseback acrobatics, belly dancing, etc. It takes place at night in a huge imitation of an old castle. \u20ac15. \nFootball: 2 Stade de Marrakesh (\u0645\u0644\u0639\u0628 \u0645\u0631\u0627\u0643\u0634). This is multi-use but mostly for soccer, with a capacity of 41,356. It's the home ground of Kawkab, who play in Botola 2 the second tier. In Dec 2025 - Jan 2026 it hosts matches in the Africa Cup of Nations.  (updated Feb 2024)\n\n\n=== The Medina ===\nThe historic district of the city.\nThe main square in the Medina is Djemaa El-Fna. It is surrounded by endless labyrinths of souks (bazaars) and alley ways covering all of the Medina. Djemma El-Fna is a must as there is always something to see there day and night whether it be snake charmers, acrobats, sooth-sayers,or the musicians and food stalls. At night the square really comes to life as people navigate toward the exotic aromas and the entertaining sights. As the evening darkens, the hustle & bustle of activity rages on. The exotic music appears louder and more hypnotic.\nThe Medina is also the place to stay in a Riad, a Moroccan house with an internal courtyard. Most windows are inward facing towards the central atrium. This design of property suits Islamic tradition as there is no obvious wealth statement being made externally, no windows to peer through. Entering a Riad is like discovering an Aladdin's Cave in comparison to its non-descript exterior. They are great places to stay and offer an intimate and relaxing retreat.\nDirectly south of the Djemaa El-Fna is Rue Bab Agnaou. A five-min walk takes you straight to the famous Bab Agnaou entrance to the Kasbah district of the Medina. The Bab Agnaou entrance, through the ramparts, is by far the most impressive entrance of all medina rampart entrances.\nThe Kasbah, in comparison to the Derbs (streets) surrounding the Djemaa El-Fna, portrays a calmer, less abrasive atmosphere. It is home to the Royal Palace, also the former El - Badi Palace and the Saadian Tombs. This naturally creates better security, cleaner streets and a hint of being a special place within the medina. The Kasbah has its own little bazaars (Souikas), food stalls, restaurants, hotels and riads for travellers to enjoy.\n\n\n=== Hammams ===\nHammams are baths, often close to mosques to facilitate the performance of ablutions. In guidebooks and signs that call them \"Moroccan Turkish Baths\" the name \"Turkish\" is a misnomer, since Morocco (unlike Egypt or Syria) was never under Ottoman rule, but the historical role of the baths is authentic in Morocco.\n\n3 Les Bains de Marrakech, 2 Derb Sedra, Bab Agnaou (same building as Riad Mehdi) (inside Bab Agnaou), \u260f +212 438 1428, mghedira@lesbainsdemarrakech.com. 09:00-19:30.

Reception and attendants are proficient in speaking English, however, the scrubbing and massage personnel speak only very basic vocabulary.

Until 01:00. Friendly staff, however, no English or French; other customers likely to help you out. 500 dirham. (updated May 2018)\n\n\n=== Desert trekking ===\nMarrakesh is not in the desert: you will spend several hours to get to the desert and day tours are therefore pretty stressful. If you have the time, spend at least one night in the desert or in a town close to your desert trekking destination. Beware of tours that don't include meals and water as they will drop you at 100 dirham restaurants far from any other option. Because of this and the kickback from shops you will visit, multi-day trips to Merzouga can cost as little as 600 dirham if you play agencies against each other.\nA good alternative to big desert trips is a day-trip to the Agafay desert. It is rockier (less sandy), but a common trip for the locals.\n\n\n== Buy ==\n\nAlong with the major souk (Arabic for 'market') adjacent to the Djemaa El-Fna, there are a plethora of smaller souks throughout the city, where any number of products can be had. In any of them, you generally need to bargain. Keep an eye out for a wide array of hand-crafted candle-holding lanterns, as well as spectacular displays of local spices.\nMost shops sell the same handful of items. But if you wander a little off from El-Fna, you can find small workshops with real craftsmen making handmade goods. You then get to talk to craftsmen of the item you bought. If you buy shoes or clothes, they can also make alterations for you, and there are a few places that make unique products.\nArgan oil, produced only in Morocco, is used in Moroccan cooking and beauty treatments. If you enjoy its unique nutty flavor, be sure to pick some up in the souks. It will cost you about 70 dirham per 100 ml at local supermarket for cooking oil or 200 dirham for genuine cosmetic oil.\n\nMarrakech is home to a large tanning industry, and leather goods of high quality can be bought here cheaply. Check out camel leather items especially - jackets, round poufs (little ottomans), and handbags.\nFor the shoes, always check they have no paper inside sole because it is very common. Do not be fooled by demonstration of bending the shoe back and forth; try it yourself by feeling and hearing how the paper bends. For poor quality shoes you should not pay more than 40 dirham, and for a good pair no more than 90 dirham. Shop around and learn the difference in shoe quality.\nAlso of interest would be items made of the local cactus silk, which is really rayon, a natural fiber made of plant cellulose and produced in Morocco. Rayon holds the chemical dyes well, which accounts for the vibrant range of true colors (natural dyes cannot produce a \"true\" color). On offer are scarves, handbags, tablecloths, bedspreads and throws in stunning colors. Some merchants try to charge a premium price for this \"cactus silk\". Check well because there are many fakes and sellers will usually tell you any lie to get you to pay a high price.\nBe sure to wander around the potters' souk, and look for brightly colored platters and bowls, as well as tagines (large, lidded cookpots) in all sizes\nLovely cashmere shawls can also be had for less than a fiver with a little bargaining.\n\nIf you cannot stand the bargaining, there are two government-run shops where you can buy handicrafts at fixed prices. Look for boutique d'artisans. One is near Djemaa El-Fna while the other one is in the ville nouvelle.\n\n1 Les \u00e9tablissements Boucha\u00efb, 7, Derb Ba\u00efssi Kasbah Boutouil (on Rue de La Kasbah), \u260f +212 524381853. Huge two-story store with fixed prices. Carpets, spices, argon oil, jewelry, ceramics, furniture, wood handcrafts, etc. Check out the prices on the webpage before you go to get and idea of the cost of the items you are interested in. \nAn option to explore the souks in a more tranquil way is to go during the Friday prayer. Although some shops will be closed, most stay open and are significantly less crowded than at other times.\nThe Apple and Samsung smartphones being sold on Djemaa El-Fna are Chinese-built fakes; they work fine but employ less storage and cheaper components than the originals. Bargain accordingly.\n\n2 Chez Monseur Michelin, 83 Riad Zitoun. Handmade bags and fashion items made from recycled tires and inner tubes. (updated Mar 2015)\n3 Faissal, 119 Rue Mouassine (next to Maison de la Photographie), \u260f +212 696972001, bennounatheweaver@gmail.com. Tiny workshop making scarves in wool, cotton, and linen. (updated Aug 2019)\n Maison du Caftan, 65 Rue Sidi el Yamani, \u260f +212 5244-41051. 09:00-20:00. Boutique specializing in traditional Moroccan caftans. 1000 dirham. (updated Oct 2024)\n\n\n=== Cash ===\nYou will need cash in Marrakech. Restaurants accept cards but you will need cash for all shops, taxis and to pay your hotel tourist tax. You can withdraw cash from ATMs in the airport.\n\n\n=== Prices ===\nIn order to not become (heavily) overcharged: If there is no price tag, ask for the price first. This applies to both products and services.\nAs a guide for prices, maximum and generous prices you should pay.\n\nDjellaba, long coat with hood for men, made of cotton/wool. Low quality: 90 dirham. Good (thick) quality: 300 dirham.\nPaintings, depends on the quality and size but no more than 50 dirham for a 70x50cm.\nShisha, 150 dirham for the smallest ones. Prices then vary with size and quality.\nTobacco for shisha, 20 dirham. There are many flavours and decent prices at the duty-free store at the airport in Marrakech.\nShoes, for home, no more than 50 dirham for a good one, for the street no more than 90 dirham for a good quality one.\nLamp, no more than 60 dirham for a medium size lamp.\nWoven beanie, 15 dirham.\nT-shirt, no more than 50 dirham for a large.\nSmall wooden snake toys, 5 dirham.\nSmall teapot (2-3 cups), 90-100 dirham.\nMedium size cooking tagine 40 dirham. (Choose carefully, glazed tagines have a risk of releasing unsafe levels of lead.)\nDress for women, poor quality, not wool, 30 dirham.\nCarpets: 1,000 dirham for a white wool carpet that is 8 ft x 12 ft\nHenna tattoo: medium-sized design should cost no more than 50 dirham (Ask for brown henna if you are allergic to PPP black henna, the brown henna is natural and safe)\nYou can order special gold jewellery items like a chain with your name on it or using a customised design but ensure you have agreed on the price beforehand.\n250 g of gunpowder tea, 30 dirham. Although best bought at a supermarket.\nRound piece of bread, 1.5 dirham.\nSpice mixes, 80 dirham/kg. Cumin, curcuma, cinnamon, ground ginger, etc. 40-60 dirham/kg\nAlso see Morocco#Buy. Do not offer a price that you are not willing to pay. Even hostel prices can be haggled.\nRemember, sellers are just the middle man, they do not produce it, except maybe for some kinds of lamps, and they pay very little to the people who actually make it. Also, never pay in advance. And never let anyone write you an invoice. It is a bad idea and in most of the cases you will never see your goods or money back.\nMost major banks and a slew of cash exchange shops can be found in a cluster around Arset el bilk (next to the main square). Most banks don't accept Unionpay and many ATMs displaying the Unionpay logo actually don't support the cards regardless of what Unionpay or the bank's website will tell you. Apparently the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale banks can do withdrawals from 16:00-21:00.\nBe aware that if you are shopping at western stores like Zara, that the return policies are different. Contrary to many other countries, purchases by credit card can only be exchanged, not returned. However, cash purchases can be returned for a refund.\n\n\n== Eat ==\n\n\n=== How to eat (well) in the Djemaa El-Fna ===\n\nEach night in the Djemaa El-Fna rows of street stalls are set up under giant white tents. The huts targeting tourists serve similar fare and have menus printed in French, Arabic and usually English. Everyone has tajine, couscous, brochette and some variety of soups. Some have specialities like offal, egg sandwiches or special tajines. Be aware that most restaurants employ rather insistent \"greeters,\" who are very aggressive in trying to customers for their stall. The line 'we already ate' seems to work well to get them to stop. As of 2018, the \"greeters\" mentioned above have changed strategies to one of harassment and insults. They try to separate couples and corner women while hurling insults.\nIf you want to eat well in Marrakech, do what the locals do and eat at the food stalls in the square. It is a common misconception that these stalls are only here for the tourists. Actually, they have been in existence long before Marrakech became a tourist destination. All of the stalls can be regarded as perfectly safe to eat at. They are strictly licensed and controlled by the government, especially now as it is a popular destination for tourists. The locals eat at the cheaper stalls that don't employ greeters and serve the more interesting food: snails, sheep head, lentils and beans.\nSome tips:\n\nPrices tend to vary a little. Depending upon how hungry you are, you can pay anything from 10 dirham for a bread filled with freshly grilled sausages, or perhaps a bowl of harira soup to 100 dirham for a full three-course meal with salad, bread, starter, main course, and tea.\nTry harira (great soup, of lamb/beef, red lentils and vegetables) and the fried aubergines. Don't be afraid-try the lamb head: it's really tasty. The \"bull stew\" (beef stew) should also be given a chance in the same stalls.\nDon't miss the tea! There is a row of tea sellers along the front of the food stalls who each sell tea for 3 dirham each (as of 2011). Most of the tea at these stalls is actually ginseng tea with cinnamon and ginger... most delicious and welcoming. They also have cake, made of basically the same spices, which can be a bit overpowering.\nAll food stalls at Djemaa El-Fna display the price on the menus, making it less likely you'll be overcharged, but many will bring starters to you without asking, then charge for them at the end.\nDrinks are rarely on the menu so it is better to ask the price of them before ordering, as they can often be comparatively high. On the other hand, some stalls offer free mint tea to encourage you to choose them.\nEarly mornings, look for people frying riifa in the covered part opposite the Koutoubia. Riifa is dough stretched and flattened and folded over, then cooked in a frying pan, and is best described as a Moroccan version of a pancake or crepe.\n\n\n=== Budget ===\n1 Chez Chegrouni, Avenue Jamaa El Fna (near the main entrance to the market.). Their vegetarian couscous is supposedly the only true vegetarian couscous in town; it's also bland but they give you plenty of it. Prices go up if you sit on the terrace. Usually packed full of good-time tourists. 30 dirham. (updated Sep 2022)\n2 Chez Yassine, 70 Avenue Fatima Zohra (5 min north from the Koutoubia mosque, 70 Rue Fatima Zohra Rmila (next to the Bacha hamam)). Not much choice but served by very friendly people. Tajines and pizzas are great and you can also order skewers that are not on the menu. 30 dirham tagines. (updated Sep 2022)\n3 Henna Cafe, 93 Arset Aouzal Souikat, bab Doukala (go to the taxi rank at Dar El Basha and walk 100 m up towards Bab Doukala. Henna Caf\u00e9 is on the right side), \u260f +212 656566374, info@hennacafemarrakech.com. 11:00-20:00. A pretty little cafe on 3 floors with an orange sign on the berber hand-carved wooden facade opened in November 2011.

The Henna Caf\u00e9 offers safe henna body adornment as well-ranging from a 50 dirham small motif on your hand to a full arm complex design for a wedding from 500 dirham. All profits go to local causes. Henna cafe was set up by the owners of Riad Cinnamon and Riad Papillon and Vivid Trading in order to start to 'give back' to Marrakech and offer support to those who might want it. The caf\u00e9 offers free English lessons to Moroccan women so that they can find employment out of the home. 40 dirham mains. (updated Sep 2022)\n4 Chez Bismilah, 193 Souk El kebir. Amazing food and wonderful service. The owner is very kind and the fantastic chef is a humble lady who cooks perfectly all the traditional moroccan recipes. Tayine Royale is recommended.

Artisanal pizzas, traditional Italian dishes and warm atmosphere. Average of 100-200 dirham per dish. (updated Oct 2024)\n\n\n=== Mid-range ===\nFor more upscale eateries (and especially for non-Moroccan cuisine) you generally must go outside the Medina to Ville Nouvelle.\n\n6 Associacion Amal (situated at the intersection of Rue Ibn Sibna and Rue Allal Ben Ahmed), \u260f +212-5-24-44-68-96. Lunch: daily 12:00-16:00, dinner: groups of min. 10 people by reservation only. Here you can experience lunch similar to what Moroccans eat at home: this women's aid association provides women with education in exchange for food which is then sold for financing the model.

The food is not necessarily better than elsewhere, but it is one of the few restaurants that serves alcohol. It also has a completely enclosed upstairs terrace, which is ideal for views of the square when the weather is bad.

Traditional and modern Moroccan cuisine. Moroccan wine served by bottle and glass. Stylish restaurant with tall white columns. 450 dirham menu. \n\n\n== Drink ==\nStreet vendors offer fresh orange juice (jus d'Orange) by the glass for 4 dirham. Try it with a dash of salt like the locals, but be wary of vendors who try and water the juice down with tap water. Also, pay attention when you buy as they offer 2 types of orange... the blood orange juice costs 10 dirham per glass and a misunderstanding on what you want to drink could occur.\nConfirm the price of your orange juice and pay for it before you drink. Unscrupulous vendors will sometimes try to charge you 10 dirham for a 4-dirham glass of jus d'Orange, so don't accept your drink until you've paid the correct amount.\nBe wary also, that they do not always clean the glasses very well so it is possible to get an upset stomach from the juice.\nThere is a very limited selection of places selling alcohol in the Medina.\n\n1 Chesterfield Pub (Bar Anglais), 115 Avenue Mohammed V (In the Hotel Nassim). 09:00-01:00. A slightly unusual experience, apparently an 'English pub' it serves Moroccan lager and has an outside pool in a courtyard with palm trees, not an entirely English experience.

It serves a decent pint. \n2 Le Salama, 40 Rue des Banques (On Jeema El Fna, facing Cafe de France, take the road to the left of Caf\u00e9 de France (as in walking behind it).

Wherever you choose (or can afford) to stay it really is a must to visit one of the riad hotels to see this amazing style of architecture. Most riad managers will be happy to show you around provided that they are not too busy and in some riads you can even book a lunch or dinner without being a resident provided that the riad is not privately rented. For example, see Riad Cinnamon, Riad Laksiba and Riad Papillon.\nThere are three main zones to sleep: Medina, Gu\u00e9liz (also known as Ville Nouvelle), and the surroundings of the city. The Medina has the highest concentration of very cheap hotels and riads (small palaces), while Gu\u00e9liz is much more quiet and most of the hotels are mid price (including showers in the room, breakfast service), but going to the Medina from the Gu\u00e9liz by taxi costs about 10-15 dirham and can take a long time at busy periods (evenings and weekends).\nThe surroundings have all the huge tourist hotels, the ones that usually come with what the travel agencies offer. They can be further away from the medina and the rest of the city, but have big swimming pools, restaurants, and many services.\n\n\n==== Dars ====\nThe Medina is packed with Riads and Dars (old grand houses converted into hotels and inns). Traditionally, riads should have gardens; with smaller dars having open courtyards. However the term riad is now used loosely to describe any house with an internal open-air center. These are wonderful places to stay to get a feel for life in Marrakech.\n\n1 Dar Attajmil, Marrakech-Medina, 23 Rue Laksour, Bab Laksour (Once entered Bab Laksour, take the second alley right, keep on until no. 23.), \u260f +212 524 426966, contact@darattajmil.com.

Instead, Romanian citizens in need of assistance should contact the embassy in Rabat.) \n British Honorary Consulate in Marrakech, R\u00e9sidence Taib 55, Boulevard Zerktouni, Gueliz, \u260f +212 5 2442 0846, fax: +212 5 2443 5276. M-F 08:00-13:00. \nMost other foreign embassies and consulates in Morocco are in Rabat, with a few more consulates in Casablanca.\n\n\n== Stay safe ==\nMarrakech is a generally safe city, with police presence. However, staying alert about your surroundings and taking general safety precautions is always a good idea like everywhere. Here are some tips:\n\nViolent crime is normally not a major problem, but thefts are known to happen. Keep your money close and hidden, and avoid poorly lit streets or alleys at night.\nGuides offering their services should display an official badge from the local tourist authorities.\nIn the Medina, if someone tells you a street is closed, ignore them, they are lying. It is a scam to lure you into a quiet alley to mug you.\nBe especially careful about being drugged, especially as a solo traveller. The common and easy-to-make drug GHB only lasts three hours and is undetectable in the body after 7 hours, so if you are attacked, take action immediately.\nBe careful ordering room service if you are a solo traveller, as even older women can be targets for robbery. Don't ask the waiter to enter your room.\nGet one of the shopkeepers to dress you up with a berber style scarf, for men and women, it will cover your face (leaving only space for your eyes) and you can remain undetected and will definitely not be harassed by the shopkeepers, one or two beggars may catch on that you are still a tourist from the way you are dressed though, so bear that in mind.\n\n\n=== Emergency phone numbers ===\n Police, \u260f 19. \n Ambulance/ Fire, \u260f 15. \n\n\n=== Hospitals ===\n Inb Tofail Hospital, Rue Abdelouahab Derraq, \u260f +212 4444 8011. \n Polyclinique du Sud, 2 Rue Yougoslavie, Gueliz, \u260f +212 4444 7999, +212 4444 8372, fax: +212 4443 2424. In case of a medical emergency, it's always a good idea to know where to find the local physicians who speak your language. According to the U.S. Consulate website, Dr. Taarji Bel Abbass at the Polyclinique du Sud speaks \"fair to good English\". \n\n\n=== Drinking water ===\nDon\u2019t expect a good quality of tap water In Marrakech. While locals drink it with no problems, visitors often find it hard to digest and swallow. To be safe, opt for bottled mineral water, available at the numerous marketplace kiosks and food stalls. Make sure that the cap seal has not been broken, since vendors have been known to save money by refilling plastic bottles from the tap. At restaurants, ask for your drinks without ice, which are usually made with tap water.\n\n\n=== Touts and scams ===\nA Moroccan idiom is \"Marrakech, Arnakech\" (\"Marrakech, Scam\"): Marrakech is the city with the most inflated prices, the most persistent touts and the most cunning scammers. Even Moroccans who visit Marrakech complain. So all the warnings listed on main page about Morocco should be taken extra seriously. On the plus side, at least since September 2016 (and still valid in April 2017), the police cleaned up a lot; so take these items with a grain of salt and keep an open mind:\n\n\"It's closed\"/\"it is a prayer area\"/\"you cannot go there, it is not a tourist area\":  This is a common technique by scammers pretending to be tourist guides. Some will even have printed badges with photos and documents pretending to be from the Ministry of Tourism. They will ask you or guess where you are going and say that it's closed. Immediately after or later in the conversation, they will lure you to the location they want you to go, usually some sort of commerce with inflated prices. If a stranger approaches you and claims a location of interest is closed, it is very likely a scam. Shake your head, ignore possible shouting and keep walking.\n\"Only every 15 days\":  Another technique is to say a group of Berber only comes every 15 days to do commerce. Buy now, or miss the opportunity!\nTanneries: It is a common scam near the tanneries in the medina to invite tourists for a free tour to the tanneries and then aggressively demand money. You can visit the tanneries for free, but be prepared to be intimidated by fake guides. Maybe better to go only in a group. The tanneries are always open thorugh the year, so avoid people telling you that there is a short time to see/buy.\nDirections then pay: If strangers are showing you the way and following you, they may ask you for money at the end of showing directions.\nSnake charmers: Stay at a distance unless willing to pay 20 dirham.  They will put a snake around your neck for picture and expect payment.\nTaxi drivers in the \"tourist hot spots\" (train station, gare routiere, agence CTM, Djeema El-Fna), by default, do not use the meter, though they have to by law, and they overcharge a lot: Either insist on the meter (good luck with that) or agree on a flat price up front. By meter, the trip from the train station to Djeema El-Fna is 13 dirham during daytime, a price of 20 dirham is a good deal for a tourist, regular asking price is 50 to 70 dirham. If your luggage permits, just walking 100 m down the street, away from the \"tourist hot spot\", and hailing a taxi will get a cheaper fare. (or even a metered fare).\nDjeema El-Fna is now patrolled by tourist police and one can actually walk there pretty much hassle free, except for: At night time, the food stalls can be pretty \"aggressive\" when trying to convince you to eat there. \"Aggressive\" as in shoving the menu into your face, while blocking your path or grabbing your hand because they are sure you are an \"old friend\", starting a lengthy, friendly conversation. And they still try the \"complimentary XY\" trick where they'll serve you spoonfuls of fries, salads or other items while you are already eating - each tiny plate shows up as 5 dirham on the bill. The latter can be easily avoided by insisting on paying immediately when your food arrives and then just walking away after you finished your meal. On the plus side: With all the tourist police present, (April 2017) simply raising your voice when telling the same guy \"la, shokran!\" (no, thank you!) for the 3rd time or when debating a bill that lists items you did not order will probably make them stop for fear of police intervention.\nWhen ignoring touts, you might get dismissive remarks shouted after you, usually tailored to your (guessed) nationality: Unless you know at least French really well, just keep on ignoring them.\nWhen you get lost in the Medina, you should never have to pay more than 20 dirham to a random person to get you at least out of the medina to a taxi that can drop you of someplace from which you can navigate. Again, agree on a price upfront and have the exact amount ready (or change en route in some shop).\nHenna tattoos are popular with locals and tourists alike. But among the many genuine traders are some scam artists who offer a free henna tattoo only to charge ridiculous prices afterwards (up to 10 times as much as locals would have to pay). Simply refuse any \"free\" henna tattoos. And, in Marrakech more than in other places, be wary of overly good henna: It is probably regular, cheap henna, mixed with chemicals like PPD to make it appear darker (i.e. of higher quality). This is not only questionable from an overall health perspective but it can lead to serious allergic reactions.\nAlways remember: Most Moroccans are incredibly friendly, honest people, so sometimes making a fuss in public can generate unwanted attention for a scam artist and shame them into backing off.\n\n\n== Go next ==\n\nMarrakech can make a good base for exploring the High Atlas or for organizing one to four day Sahara treks. The following are towns in the High Atlas that can be seen as part of a day trip:\n\n3 Amizmiz. With one of the largest Berber souks in the High Atlas Mountains every Tuesday, Amizmiz is well-worth a trip. This is especially true for those travellers wishing to experience the less urban, less touristy mountain towns of the High Atlas. The souk itself deals mostly in the ordinary household goods that any Walmart does; plan your souvenir shopping elsewhere. \n4 Asni. A lovely rural village in the Atlas mountains. \n5 Essaouira (2\u00bd hours west by car.). Charming coastal city. You will pass the goats in the Argan trees on the way there. ~250 dirham for transport only.. (updated Feb 2015)\n6 Oukaimeden. Ski lift at 3268 m. The snow falls in the mountains just south of Marrakech every winter. And it stays. Wealthy people from all over southern Morocco have since long learned to enjoy skiing in their own country. This has given the ski resort, Ouka\u00efmeden, a distinct Moroccan touch, too. You do not need to bring your ski equipment all the way from home, all you need can be rented. You should only pay around 250 dirham for a full day here (including a lift pass). Ouka\u00efmeden and the areas around are some of the greatest in Morocco, with four seasons, and ever changing nature. In summer, few people enter this area \u2014 it is probably too well known for winter sports. But staying here a day or two is a real treat. (updated Feb 2015)\n7 Ourika Valley (in the Atlas Mountains.). Tours involve stopping several times en route to the valley to look in tourist shops, a Berber house, and a collective run for women who make products out of Argan oil. Tours will also include a walk to visit the various different waterfalls. The journey can become difficult, so wear good walking and/or climbing shoes - suitable footwear is imperative. Think of clambering up rocks at the side of the river, and eventually criss-crossing over wet rocks to travel up the mountain. tours ~ 350 dirham. (updated Feb 2015)\n8 Setti Fatma (A village at the end of the proper motor road up the Ourika Valley.). The residential part is situated above the road and is not visited too much. The attractions are the lovely valley scenery and a walk to seven waterfalls - or for most day visitors one waterfall from which others can be seen. \n Cascade d'Ouzoud. Impressive three-stage waterfalls between green and pink rock slopes has almost 100 m in height and are highest in Morocco. Ride by taxi or minivan of a local tourist company may be ordered near Djemaa El-Fna or in the streets in Medina. At least half of day need for journey but full day it is better. The way goes through picturesque valleys and takes some more than two hours on one direction. Waterfalls accessible on top and by closest downstairs till the bottom where pontoon boats offer to hike just to the place of water falling. Small cafes and food/souvenir shops available before the entrance and just on downstairs. Makakus monkeys meet mostly before sunset and walk just amongst the visitors or seat on trees and rocks. The waterfalls have full power on spring and beginning of summer and may almost dry later. Sun rays sparkly highlights the water stream before sunset."

        "title": "Kyoto",
        "extract": "Ky\u014dto (\u4eac\u90fd) was the capital of Japan for over a millennium, and carries a reputation as the nation's most beautiful city and its cultural capital - even the national government's Agency for Cultural Affairs moved there in 2023.  However, visitors may be surprised by how much work they will have to do to see Kyoto's beautiful side. Most first impressions of the city will be of the urban sprawl of central Kyoto, around the ultra-modern glass-and-steel train station, which is itself an example of a city steeped in tradition colliding with the modern world.\nNonetheless, the persistent visitor will soon discover Kyoto's hidden beauty in the temples and parks which ring the city center, and find that the city has much more to offer than immediately meets the eye.\nThe city has a multi-lingual Official Travel Guide site.\n\n\n== Districts ==\n\nThough dwarfed in size by other major Japanese cities, Kyoto is vast in terms of its rich cultural heritage - the material endowment of over a thousand years as the country's imperial capital.  The city's numerous palaces, shrines, temples and other landmarks are spread out over the following districts:\n\n\n== Understand ==\nNestled among the mountains of the Kansai region of Western Honshu, Kyoto was the capital of Japan and the residence of the Emperor from 794 until the Meiji Restoration of 1868, when the capital was moved to Tokyo.  During its millennium at the center of Japanese power, culture, tradition, and religion, it accumulated an unparalleled collection of palaces, temples and shrines, built for emperors, shoguns, and monks. Kyoto was among the few Japanese cities that escaped the allied bombings of World War II and so still has an abundance of prewar buildings, such as the traditional townhouses known as machiya. However, the city is continuously undergoing modernization with some of the traditional Kyoto buildings being replaced by newer architecture, such as the Kyoto Station complex. Kyoto is home to Japan's second most prestigious university, Kyoto University.\n\n\n=== Orientation ===\nKyoto's city planners way back in 794 decided to copy the Chinese capital Chang'an (present-day Xi'an) and adopt a grid pattern, which persists to this day in the city core.  West-east streets are numbered, with Ichij\u014d-d\u014dri (\u4e00\u6761\u901a, \"First Street\") up north and J\u016bj\u014d-d\u014dri (\u5341\u6761\u901a, \"Tenth Street\") down south, but there is no obvious pattern to the names of north-south streets.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nKyoto truly exhibits the four seasons of spring, summer, fall and winter, with many flowers in spring and changing leaves in the fall attracting hordes of tourists. Kyoto is particularly humid in summer, as the city is flanked by mountains. From about mid-June to the end of July is the rainy season, so most travelers avoid this time. The type of rain ranges from drizzles to off-and-on showers to downpours. There is another typhoon season in late August and September. Winters are generally cold but without snowfall. They usually don't start until the end of December and last until March when the plum blossoms begin to open, followed by cherry blossoms.\n\n\n== Get in ==\n\n\n=== By plane ===\n\nKyoto does not have its own airport, but is served by Osaka's two airports, Kansai International and Itami. There is an excellent road and railway network between the two cities.\n\n\n==== Through Kansai International Airport ====\n\n\n===== By train =====\nYou can fly into Kansai International Airport (KIX IATA) in Osaka Bay and then get a train to Kyoto. Kansai Airport Station is opposite the arrival lobby where the Haruka limited express train, operated by West Japan Railway (JR West), can be caught. The Haruka runs to Kyoto in 75\u201380 minutes and a one-way ticket costs \u00a52,900 for an open (non-reserved) seat or \u00a53,430 for a reserved seat.\nThere are a few ways that foreign tourists can use the Haruka at a discount. One way is to buy a one-day Kansai Area Pass. At a cost of only \u00a52,400 (\u00a52,350 if you book online), this pass costs \u00a5500 less than a regular ticket. You will need to show a passport issued by a foreign country with Japanese temporary visitor visa on it when purchasing a ticket. Note that you are limited to purchasing one pass per trip, so if you return to Kansai Airport on the Haruka you will have to pay the regular fare.\nThe above ticket can be purchased online or at the Kansai Airport train station. Some other, more expensive JR West passes where trips on the Haruka are valid include the Kansai Wide Area Pass and the Sanyo Area Pass.\nThe other train company operating out of Kansai Airport is the Nankai Railway. They offer a discounted ticket if you are interested in traveling to Central Kyoto, called the Kyoto Access Ticket. For \u00a51250 this ticket includes a journey on the Nankai Railway Airport service to Tengachaya (\u5929\u4e0b\u8336\u5c4b) station in Osaka, followed by a trip on the Osaka Sakaisuji Subway Line. With a second transfer at Awaji station you can travel to Kyoto on the Hankyu Main Line. Under this plan you can reach Central Kyoto in approximately 1 hr 45 min. You have the option to upgrade to the fastest Nankai train service, the Rapi:t, for an additional charge.\n\n\n===== By bus =====\nComfortable limousine buses run from the airport to Kyoto Station twice an hour. The ticket costs \u00a52,600 one-way or \u00a54,260 round-trip. Buses discharge at the south end of Kyoto Station; return tickets are sold from a vending machine on the first floor of the Hotel Keihan Kyoto. The ride from Terminal 1 takes 88 minutes, but can take longer when there is traffic (90 \u2013 135 min).\n\n\n==== Through Itami Airport ====\nItami Airport (ITM IATA), also called Osaka International Airport although it no longer has international flights, is Kansai region's largest domestic airport and the closest airport to Kyoto. Travelers flying from other areas in Japan will most likely arrive here. The easiest way to get to Kyoto from Itami Airport is by Limousine Bus, which generally runs every 20 min throughout the day. The trip takes about 50 min and costs \u00a51,340.\nAlternatively, you can take a combination of monorail and train, which requires one or two changes:\n\nTake the Osaka Monorail to Hotarugaike, the Hankyu Takarazuka Line to Juso, and the Hankyu Kyoto Line to Kyoto (1 hr, \u00a5670)\nTake the Osaka Monorail to Minami-Ibaraki and change to the Hankyu Kyoto Line to Kyoto (1 hr, \u00a5760)\nWhereas the Limousine Bus will leave you at Kyoto Station in the southern part of Kyoto, the Hankyu Railway runs to Shij\u014d Street in central Kyoto.\n\n\n=== By train ===\n\nMost visitors arrive at JR Kyoto Station by Shinkansen (bullet train) from Tokyo. Nozomi trains take approximately 2 hr 15 min to Kyoto and cost \u00a514170 one-way. Travel agencies in Tokyo and Kyoto sell Nozomi tickets with \u00a5700-1,000 discount. If you buy a ticket in an agency, it is \"open date\" - you can board any train as long as it is not full. All you have to do is show up at the train station, register your agency ticket and then you will be reserved a seat.\nHikari trains, which run less frequently and make a few more stops, cover the trip in around 2 hr 45 min, while all-stopping Kodama trains take around 3 hr 40 min. Only the Hikari and Kodama trains can be used by Japan Rail Pass holders unless a Nozomi supplement is paid.\nTickets can be purchased in advance through Japan Railways' official SmartEX App, available in English and other languages, with a \u00a5200 discount. Look for hayatoku fares, which can offer big savings on trips purchased at least three days in advance. For example, two passengers from Tokyo could travel for \u00a512020 each in ordinary class on the Nozomi or for \u00a511200 each in the Green Car (first class) if willing to take the all-stations Kodama service.\nTravelers can also take advantage of the Puratto (Platt) Kodama Ticket (Japanese), which offers a discount for Kodama services if you purchase at least one day in advance. You get a reserved seat and a coupon for a free drink (including beer) which can be redeemed at a \"Kiosk\" convenience counter inside the station. With this ticket a trip from Tokyo to Kyoto costs \u00a510500. There is only one Kodama service per hour from Tokyo, and a few early-morning Kodama trains cannot be used with this ticket. Travel from Nagoya with this ticket costs \u00a54400.\nDuring travel periods when the Seishun 18 Ticket is valid, you can go from Tokyo to Kyoto during the day in about 8\u00bd hours using all-local trains. Traveling in a group is the best way to get discounts. The usual fare is \u00a58360, however a party of three costs around \u00a54000 per person, and a group of five traveling together drops the price down to \u00a52410 per person.\nFor travel in the Kansai region, a cheaper and almost as fast alternative is the JR shinkaisoku (\u65b0\u5feb\u901f) rapid service, which connects to Osaka, Kobe and Himeji at the price of a local train.  For a slightly cheaper price you can use the private Hankyu or Keihan lines to Osaka and Kobe, or the Kintetsu line to Nara.  The Kansai Thru Pass includes travel on the private lines through to Kyoto, and this may prove cheaper that a JR Pass if you are staying a few days in the area.\nThose travelling from the Hokuriku region can use Thunderbird (\u30b5\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u30c9) limited express trains from Tsuruga. From Tsuruga, you can catch the Hokuriku Shinkansen to Fukui, Komatsu, Kanazawa and beyond.\n\n\n==== Hokuriku Arch Pass ====\nThe Hokuriku Arch Pass allows unlimited travel between Tokyo and the Kansai area via the Hokuriku region, using the Hokuriku Shinkansen from Tokyo to Kanazawa and the Thunderbird from Kanazawa to Kyoto and Osaka. At a cost of \u00a524500 for seven consecutive days of travel (\u00a525500 if purchased inside Japan), the Arch Pass is about half the cost of the national Japan Rail Pass. On the other hand, a trip from Tokyo to Kyoto is twice as long via Kanazawa compared to the more popular Tokaido Shinkansen, though the trip times will go down a little when the next section opens on 16 March 2024.\n\n\n==== Overnight travel ====\nDirect overnight train service between Tokyo and Kyoto were plentiful in the past decades, but as time went on services were pretty much eliminated. As a result, taking the bus is now the easiest way to travel between these two cities at night.\nOvernight travel between Tokyo and Kyoto is still possible with a stopover in another city along the way, which is easy to do with a Japan Rail Pass or a basic long-distance ticket that is valid over a period of several days.\n\n\n=== By car ===\nKyoto is easily reached by car via the Meishin Expressway between Nagoya and Osaka, but you'll definitely want to park your car on the outskirts of the city and use public transport to get around.  Most attractions are in places built well before the existence of automobiles, and the availability of parking varies between extremely limited and non-existent. Furthermore, what little parking is available might be outrageously expensive.\n\n\n=== By bus ===\n\nAs Kyoto is a major city, there are many day and overnight buses which run between Kyoto and other locations throughout Japan, which can be a cheaper alternative than shinkansen fares. As the cultural center of Japan, Kyoto's bus connections are almost as numerous as Tokyo's. There are bus operators with night buses from Yamagata, Sendai, Koriyama, Fukushima, Tochigi, Utsunomiya, Saitama (Omiya), Yokohama, Niigata, Karuizawa, Toyama, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka, Numazu, Mishima, Matsue, Izumo, Tokuyama, Yamaguchi, Imabari, Matsuyama, Kochi, Fukuoka (Hakata), Takeo, Sasebo (Huis Ten Bosch). Same-day highway buses depart from Tsu, Yokkaichi, Nagoya, Toyokawa, Toyohashi, Takayama, Okayama, Kurashiki, Tsuyama, Fukuyama, Onomichi, and Hiroshima.\nMost highway buses will pick up and drop off passengers at Kyoto Station. JR Buses congregate at the Karasuma Exit (\u70cf\u4e38\u53e3) at the north side of the station. Other companies will use the Hachijo Exit (\u516b\u6761\u53e3) on the south side, either at the station or at one of the nearby hotels.\nAnother bus stop is called Kyoto Fukakusa (\u4eac\u90fd\u6df1\u8349). This stop is nowhere close to Kyoto station, but rather is 4.5 km to the south on the Meishin Expressway. Some JR Buses heading to and from Osaka will use this stop instead of calling at Kyoto Station. The closest train stations are Fujinomori on the Keihan Line (5-10 min walk) and Takeda on the Kintetsu Line and Kyoto Subway (10-15 min walk); all can be used to reach central Kyoto. Local city buses also runs to Kyoto station from the nearby Youth Science Center a few times per hour.\n\n\n==== From Tokyo ====\nThe run between Tokyo and the Kansai region is the busiest in Japan. Buses use the Tomei or Chuo Expressway from Tokyo to Nagoya, then the Meishin Expressway to Kyoto. Trips take between 7 and 9 hours depending on the route and stops.\nFierce competition between operators has led to better amenities and lower prices. Part of this strategy is the adoption of dynamic pricing on many bus routes. This generally means that daytime trips, weekday trips, tickets bought in advance and buses carrying more passengers are cheaper, while night trips, weekend/holiday trips, walk-up fares and buses with fewer (and more comfortable) seats will be more expensive.\nAs a rule of thumb, fares for a weekday trip between Tokyo and Kyoto go for \u00a54000-6000 per person during the daytime, and \u00a55000-8000 per person for overnight trips. Children usually pay half the adult fare.\nTwo of the major bus operators between Tokyo and Kyoto are Willer Express and JR Bus. Tickets for all carriers can generally be purchased at major departure points, and can also be purchased (with some Japanese language help) at kiosks inside convenience stores.\nWiller Express runs daytime and overnight trips with a variety of seating options ranging from standard seats to luxurious shell seats. Bus journeys can be booked online in English, and Willer's Japan Bus Pass is valid on all of their routes with some exceptions. Willer's buses in Tokyo leave from the Shinjuku Highway Bus Terminal (Busta Shinjuku), above the JR tracks at Shinjuku Station, which is served by many of Japan's highway bus operators. Willer also sells tickets for other bus operators on their website, but these trips are not valid with Willer's Japan Bus Pass.\nJR Bus reservations can be made in English through their Kousoku Bus Net web site. You can also make reservations in train stations at the same \"Midori-no-Madoguchi\" ticket windows used to reserve seats on trains. Buses depart from Tokyo Station - Yaesu Exit (\u516b\u91cd\u6d32\u53e3) and from Busta Shinjuku.\n\n\n== Get around ==\n\n \nThe sheer size of the city of Kyoto, and the distribution of tourist attractions around the periphery of the city, make the city's public transport system invaluable.\nOne of the easiest ways to plan a route is through Navitime. This website contains station-to-station route plans, which reference public and private trains and subways as well as buses throughout Japan.\nIf you are planning to travel beyond city limits you might consider using the tickets from Surutto Kansai. For use in west Japan, including Kyoto, there are some other useful tickets: a rechargeable smart card, ICOCA, can be used on rail, subway and bus networks in the Kansai area and also Okayama, Hiroshima, Nagoya (Kintetsu trains) and Tokyo (JR East trains). These cards are available at vending machines at these rail stations, and cost \u00a52000, which includes a \u00a5500 deposit that will be refunded when the card is returned at JR West Station. For use in Kyoto only there are some other useful tickets:\n\nThe Kyoto Sightseeing Card can be purchased as a one-day (adults \u00a5900/children \u00a5450) or two-day pass (\u00a51700/\u00a5850). It can be used for unlimited travel on the subway and city buses as well as a part of the Kyoto bus route. The two-day pass has to be used on two consecutive days.\nThe  Traffica Kyo Card is a stored-value card in denominations of \u00a51000 or \u00a53000. It can be conveniently used up to face value on all subways and buses by simply sliding it through the ticket gate. They offer a 10% bonus value.\nCheck the Kyoto City Bus & Subway Information Guide for more information on how to use these cards.\n\n\n=== By train ===\n\nKyoto is criss-crossed by several train lines, all of which are clearly sign-posted in English. Although the lines are run independently and prices vary slightly between them, transfers can be purchased at most of the ticket machines. The Keihan train line can be useful for traveling in eastern Kyoto, while the two Keifuku (aka Randen) tram lines are an attractive way of traveling in the northwest. Across the street from the northern terminus of the Keihan Line is the Eiden line, which runs to Mount Hiei and Kurama. The Hankyu Line starts at Shijo-Kawaramachi downtown, and connects to the Karasuma Line one stop later at Karasuma. It's useful for reaching Arashiyama and the Katsura Rikyu; it runs all the way to Osaka and Kobe. JR lines run from Kyoto station to the northwest (JR Sagano line), to the southwest (JR Kyoto line) and to the southeast (JR Nara line). There are local and express trains so check if they stop at your station before you get on.\n\n\n=== By subway ===\n\nThere are two subway lines which only serve a rather small part of the city. The north-south running Karasuma Line runs under Kyoto Station, and the west-east running Tozai Line links up with it near the city center. Both are useful for travel in the city center but not really suitable for temple-hopping. The Tozai Line does connect with the Keihan Line, however, which runs parallel to the Kamo-gawa, and is convenient for reaching Gion and southern Kyoto; it also gets you within a short walk of many of the sights in eastern Kyoto.\nA one-day pass for the subway costs \u00a5800.\n\n\n=== By bus ===\n\nThe bus network is the only practical way of reaching some attractions, particularly those in north-western Kyoto. Fortunately the system is geared toward tourists, with destinations electronically displayed/announced in English as well as Japanese.  Unlike other Japanese cities, a tourist probably is advised to use the buses here.\nConfusingly however, there are two different bus companies in Kyoto, which occasionally even have overlapping line numbers.  Green-and-white Kyoto City Buses (\u5e02\u30d0\u30b9 shi-basu) travel within the city, and are the most useful for visitors; unless otherwise noted, all buses listed in this guide are city buses.  Red-and-white Kyoto Buses travel to the suburbs and are generally much less useful.\nMany buses depart from Kyoto Station, but there are well-served bus stations closer to the city center at Sanj\u014d-Kawabata just outside the Sanj\u014d Keihan subway line, and in the northern part of the city at the Kita\u014dji subway station. Most city buses and some Kyoto Buses have a fixed fare of \u00a5230, but you can also purchase a one day Kyoto bus and subway pass (\u00a51100 for adults and \u00a5550 for children under 12) with which you can ride an unlimited number of times within a one day period. The day passes can be bought from subway stations or from the bus information center just outside Kyoto Station. This is especially useful if you plan on visiting many different points of interest within Kyoto. Note that the \u00a5700 bus-only day pass was discontinued at the end of September 2023.\nThe municipal transport company publishes a very useful leaflet called Bus Navi. It contains a route map for the bus lines to most sights and information. You can pick it up at the information center in front of the main station.\n\nRaku Bus - The city has three routes (100, 101, and 102) which are specifically designed for foreign tourists wishing to hit the tourist spots quickly. The buses skip many of the non-tourist stops and are thus a faster way to get from one sight to the next. The Raku Bus #100 and #101 leave from platform D1 and B2 at Kyoto Station. The cost is \u00a5230 per ride, but the day passes are accepted as well.\nKeihan Loop Bus - Keihan operates a loop bus (300) that offers a convenient connection between Kyoto Station and the Keihan Railway. The nonstop, direct buses run every 15 minutes between the Hotel Thousand Kyoto (near Kyoto Station's Central Exit) and the Shichijo Station on the Keihan Main Line. The regular fare is \u00a5230, but if you take the bus from the Keihan Line to Kyoto Station the fare is just \u00a5100 if you buy a transfer ticket before exiting through the ticket barriers at Shichijo Station. If you are staying at the Hotel Thousand Kyoto or the adjacent Kyoto Century Hotel, you can buy a \u00a5100 ticket for the bus from your hotel. Note that several Kyoto City buses also offer a similar service (including the 206 and 208 routes) but the \u00a5100 discounted fare is only valid on the Keihan Loop Bus.\n\n\n=== By bicycle ===\nParticularly in spring and fall, but at any time of year, getting around by bicycle is an excellent option. Cycling forms a major form of personal transport year-round for locals. The city's grid layout makes navigation easy. The city is essentially flat, excepting a few places in the lower parts of the surrounding hills where you may have to climb a bit or park you bike to visit on foot. You can rent bicycles in many places in Japan for a reasonable price. During the peak tourist seasons, when roads are busy and buses tend to be crammed beyond capacity, bicycles are probably the best way to navigate Kyoto.\nKyoto's wide, straight roads make for heavy traffic in many parts of the city, but it is possible to find back alleys that are quieter and offer better chances to happen upon all sorts of sightseeing/cultural gems. Riding on major roads is OK, especially if you are confident and used to riding with traffic on the road, rather than on the sidewalk and especially again if you are used to riding/driving on the LEFT-HAND side of the road.\nBe aware that it is forbidden to park your bike where it is not explicitly authorized, in which case it could get towed and you would have to pay a fine to get it back. So you will have to find a legal bike park near the place you want to visit and pay for it. It will not be the preferred transportation mean if you have planned to go to a district and visit it by foot along a non-circular route (like the Philosopher's Path in Higashiyama).\n\n Kyoto Cycling Tour Project (KCTP), \u260f +81 75-354-3636. A five-minute walk from the North Exit (the side with the buses and Kyoto Tower) of Kyoto Station. Bikes range from \u00a51000 to \u00a52000 for an actual 27-speed mountain bike with city-tires on it; perfect for the average foreigner who is used to a 'real' bike in their home country. The following options can be added: bilingual cycling/walking map of Kyoto \u00a5100; light FREE; helmet \u00a5200; back pack; \u00a5100; rain poncho \u00a5100. They can hold on to your luggage while you are riding. There are four other locations of KCTP and you can return your bike to any location, however you will incur a \u00a5400 charge if you return the bike to a location other than the one you rented from. Guided bike tours are also available ranging from \u00a53900 (three hours) to \u00a512000 (7.5 hours) that include guide, bike rental, lunch/snacks, accident insurance and admission to some attractions on the tour. Minimum of two people to guarantee departure/maximum of 10. Needs to be reserved three days in advance if you want a tour. Don't worry if the mountain bikes sell out - Kyoto (like Tokyo) is a city with perfect kerb transitions so a 8 speed with basket and bell is fine, if a little bumpy on the river path. \nThere is a friendly bicycle rental shop across the street from the Keihan Demachiyanagi station, behind the taxi rank. \u00a5500 for a day, \u00a5750 for a day and night, and \u00a53000 for a month. \u00a53000 deposit (\u00a52000 when showing ID). Has 22\" children's bikes which come with a free helmet. Opens early (<9AM) - 7PM.\nThere is a small rental shop just north of Sanjo Keihan station on Kawabata Dori that rents bicycles, which doesn't have \"tourist signs\" attached. On the downside, they do not speak English. \u00a51000 per day.\nFor those staying more than a week or so, purchasing a used bicycle may be economical. Most bicycle shops in Kyoto offer used town bicycles with lights, bell, basket, and lock for around \u00a55000 \u2014 \u00a510,000 (plus a \u00a5500 registration fee). At least some of this cost can be made back by re-selling the bicycle just prior to departure. Cycle Eirin, a chain found throughout the city, is a good place to start.\n\n\n== Talk ==\nSee also: Kansai#Talk\nAs Kyoto is a very tourist-friendly city, staff at most of the major hotels and tourist attractions have a functional command of English, and English menus and signage are common along the tourist trail.  Outside of that, English is generally rarely spoken. Other foreign languages such as Italian, French, Korean or Mandarin may be spoken by some staff at the main tourist attractions.\nThe Japanese spoken in Kyoto is a version of the Kansai dialect spoken across Western Japan, which may be a little difficult to understand if you have just started learning Japanese. Two stereotypically Kyoto phrases are oideyasu (\u304a\u3044\u3067\u3084\u3059), meaning \"welcome\", and ookini (\u304a\u304a\u304d\u306b) for \"thank you\".  While standard Japanese is universally understood, it is not uncommon for locals to reply in dialect even when spoken to in standard Japanese. If you don't understand, just politely ask the person to repeat what they say in standard Japanese (\u6a19\u6e96\u8a9e hy\u014djungo) and they will usually oblige.\nKyoto people are also famous for their mastery of tatemae, the \"front\" used to hide their actual feelings, and you will likely be told the story of how an invitation to have some bubuzuke rice porridge is the Kyoto way of saying you've overstayed your welcome. The good news is that unless you intend to spend a couple of years working your way into Kyoto high society, you won't need to worry about this kind of thing.\n\n\n== See ==\nIndividual listings can be found in Kyoto's district articles\nKyoto offers an incredible number of attractions for tourists, and visitors will probably need to plan an itinerary in advance in order to visit as many as possible.\nJapan National Tourist Organization's self-guided \"Kyoto Walks\" pamphlet enables first time visitors to tour the city with ease and with minimum fuss by providing bus numbers, names of bus stops and clearly marked walking routes. There are a variety of self-guided walks in different districts to sample Kyoto's various sites.

Fourteen of the listed sites are in Kyoto itself, two are in the neighbouring city of Uji and one is in \u014ctsu.\nListed by location, the fourteen World Heritage Sites in the city of Kyoto are:\n\nNorthern Kyoto: Kinkaku-ji, Ry\u014dan-ji, Ninna-ji, K\u014dzan-ji, Shimogamo Shrine, Kamigamo Shrine\nCentral Kyoto: Nij\u014d Castle, Nishi Hongan-ji, T\u014d-ji\nEastern Kyoto: Kiyomizu-dera, Ginkaku-ji\nWestern Kyoto: Tenry\u016b-ji, Koke-dera\nSouthern Kyoto: Daigo-ji\n\n\n=== Imperial Palaces and Villas ===\nStroll through the regal retreats of the Imperial Palace or one of the two Imperial villas with gardens and teahouses managed by the Imperial Household Agency. These are the Imperial Palace (\u4eac\u90fd\u5fa1\u6240 Ky\u014dto-gosho) and Sent\u014d Imperial Palace (\u4ed9\u6d1e\u5fa1\u6240 Sent\u014d-gosho) in Central Kyoto, Katsura Imperial Villa (\u6842\u96e2\u5bae Katsura-riky\u016b) in Western Kyoto, and Sh\u016bgakuin Imperial Villa (\u4fee\u5b66\u9662\u96e2\u5bae Shugaku-in-riky\u016b) in Northern Kyoto. All four of these sites are open to the public by reservation through the Imperial Household Agency. The gardens located within the precincts of each palace and villa are at their most scenic during spring cherry blossom season and autumn where a riot of colors enchant visitors. Each property is still used from time to time for official state functions or for private visits by the current royal family members.\nThe Imperial Household Agency maintains a quota on the number of visitors to each site per tour. Admission is free. English guides are available at the Imperial Palace; however, tours of the Sento Imperial Palace, Katsura Villa, and Sh\u016bgakuin Villa are conducted in Japanese only (English pamphlets are given at each destination upon entry and books are available for purchase if you'd like to know more). Overseas visitors can apply online to the Imperial Household Agency in English here. On its website are write ups and videos in English for interested visitors to gauge which ones they would like to visit before making an online application. Please note that advanced applications first become available on the first day of the month, three months in advance of the applicant's preferred touring month. For example, if your preferred date of visit falls in the month of April, you can begin applying on January 1. As these visits are over subscribed by the Japanese and overseas visitors, the Imperial Household Agency has to draw lots to pick the successful applicants. All applicants are notified on the status of their applications whether they are successful or otherwise within a week after closing date. Most applicants to the Imperial Palace are accepted, and early reservation is not usually necessary; however, those planning to visit the Sent\u014d Imperial Palace, or either of the Imperial Villas should apply on the first available day of application as they are highly competitive and entire months of tours often become full within the first few days. Winter tours are typically much less competitive, but be aware that the gardens will not be as beautiful as other times of the year.\n\n Imperial household Agency Kyoto Office,, 3 Kyotogyoen, Kamigyo-ku, \u260f +81-75-211-1215. If an applicant is not successful, they can still go direct in person to the Imperial Household Agency Kyoto Office to enquire whether there are vacancies, as they typically save a few spots for walk-ins. Many people are able to do this successfully for the Imperial Palace, but it can be more of a risk for the others, so go early. \n\n\n== Do ==\nIndividual listings can be found in Kyoto's district articles\n\n\n=== Public baths ===\nPublic baths have been a cornerstone of the society for centuries in Kyoto. The first public baths, or sent\u014d (\u92ad\u6e6f), were documented in the 13th century. Soon they became one of the few places in society where social status was irrelevant. Noblemen shared baths with commoners and warriors. Today over 140 bath houses remain in Kyoto. Funaoka Onsen is the oldest of these and dubbed \"king of sent\u014d\", but newer bath houses and super sent\u014d are just as much part of the Japanese bathing culture. If you have the time, make your way to one of the many public bath houses Kyoto has to offer.\n\n1 Funaoka Onsen (\u8239\u5ca1\u6e29\u6cc9), Kyoto, Kita Ward, Murasakino Minamifunaokacho 82-1 (take bus line 206 from Kyoto station), \u260f +81-75-441-3735. 15:00 - 01:00. Funaoka Onsen is one of the oldest public bath houses in Kyoto still in operation. Its classic building is an excellent example of bath house architecture of the beginning of the 20th century. Funaoka Onsen is popular with both locals and visitors and is a must if you have an hour to spare. \u00a5430. \n\n\n=== Film industry ===\nKyoto is the traditional home of the Japanese film industry and while it has declined since its heyday in the 1950s, to this day, the majority of Japanese period dramas (\u6642\u4ee3\u5287 jidaigeki) continue to be produced in Kyoto.\n\n2 Toei Kyoto Studio Park (\u6771\u6620\u592a\u79e6\u6620\u753b\u6751 t\u014dei uzumasa eigamura), Kyoto, Ukyo Ward, Uzumasa Higashihachiokacho 10 (take bus line 75 from Kyoto station), \u260f +81-57-006-4349. 09:30 - 16:30. Toei Kyoto Studio Park is an active film studio which continues to be used for the filming of period dramas. Visitors may visit the outdoor sets used in many samurai movies, and if they are lucky, could potentially observe the filming of a period drama. \u00a52,200.   \n\n\n=== Meditation ===\nWell known for its abundance of historical sites, Kyoto often draws visitors eager to experience traditional Japanese culture. Buddhist meditation sessions are one of the most popular of these activities, and multiple options are available. In Northern Kyoto, Taizo-in and Shunko-in (both sub-temples of Myoshin-ji) offer authentic Zen meditation sessions, complete with explanations of the meaning and significance of such meditation. Reservations are necessary.\n\n\n=== Blossom viewing ===\n\n\n==== Cherry blossoms ====\n\nKyoto is arguably the most well known place in the country to view cherry blossoms, and there are certainly no lack of options. On the Official Top 100 cherry blossom spots list, three are in Kyoto (Arashiyama, Daigoji, Ninnaji).\nEastern Kyoto is particularly popular during the cherry blossom season. A walk from Nanzen-ji to Ginkaku-ji along the Philosopher's Path, lined with cherry trees, is enjoyable, as there are a variety of temples and shrines to stop at along the way. The garden of the Heian Shrine, not far from the Philosopher's Path, features colorful pink blossoms, which is a nice contrast to the white blossoms you'll see on the Philosopher's Path. The famous cherry tree in Maruyama Park is often the center of attention in the evenings when it is lit up. Vendors line the pathway leading up to it, creating a festive atmosphere. Kiyomizu-dera and Kodai-ji have extended hours during the first few days of this season offering visitors the opportunity to view them at night, lit up against the blossoms. Blossoms can also be seen along the Kamogawa River. The entire area literally blossoms in the spring!\nIn Central Kyoto the northern section of the Imperial Park is home to a variety of different types of cherry blossoms. Nijo Castle hosts its own Nijo Light-Up, in which visitors can walk the grounds of the castle at night among the cherry blossoms (typically for 10\u201314 days). You cannot enter the castle during the light-up, so those who want to enter should visit during the day to see the castle and the blossoms. Just south of Kyoto station, the grounds of Toji Temple bloom beautifully below the towering pagoda.\nIn Arashiyama, a large portion of the mountainside is bright with cherry blossoms, along with the area around Hankyu Arashiyama Station. During the day, many people enjoy viewing the blossoms on the mountainside from the \"Romantic Train\" that travels through Arashiyama. At night, the area is lit up and food stalls are set up with a variety of delicious snacks.\nNorthern Kyoto offers cherry-blossom scouts worthwhile experiences at Hirano Shrine and Kyoto Botanical Gardens, and a walk inside the large grounds of Daigo-ji in Southern Kyoto is certainly made memorable when all the blossoms are in full bloom.\n\n\n==== Plum blossoms ====\nAlthough they are less well-known to foreign tourists, who tend only to focus their attentions on seeing cherry blossoms, for those with plans to visit Kyoto from mid-February through mid-March, plum blossom viewing makes for a great alternative. Kyoto has two popular plum blossom locations; Kitano Tenmangu and the Kyoto Botanical Gardens, both in northern Kyoto. Kitano Tenmangu has a large grove of plum trees just outside the shrine entrance that, with a \u00a5600 fee, you can stroll about. Within the shrine grounds, there are many more trees (viewable for free). The shrine even hosts annual performances by geisha amidst the plum blossoms. Plum blossoms have a very pleasantly distinct fragrance. These Japanese ume trees are actually more closely related to apricot trees. However an early mistranslation by the Japanese resulted in these trees being called \"plum\" trees instead.\n\n\n=== Festivals and events ===\nSetsubun (February 3 or 4) A large bonfire and Shinto ceremony is held at Yoshida Shrine.\nCherry Blossom Season (April 1\u201315; days vary depending upon the weather) Although viewing the blossoms is enough for many, special events are often held throughout the city. (See \"Cherry Blossoms\" above)\nThe following are generally called Three Great Festivals of Kyoto (\u4eac\u90fd\u4e09\u5927\u796d\u308a Kyoto Sandai Matsuri)\n\nAoi Matsuri (\u8475\u796d, May 15) Beginning at Kyoto Imperial palace, a large procession dressed in Heian Period garbs walks to Shimogamo Shrine and finishes at Kamigamo Shrine.\nGion Matsuri (\u7947\u5712\u796d, July 17) Many Mikoshi are paraded through the streets. It is considered to be one of the top three festivals in Japan.\nJidai Matsuri (\u6642\u4ee3\u796d, October 22) People dressed in traditional garbs parade to Heian Shrine.\nAnother famous event is:\n\nDaimonji Gozan Okuribi (\u5927\u6587\u5b57\u4e94\u5c71\u9001\u308a\u706b, August 16) The hillside in Northwestern Kyoto is lit aflame in this festival honoring one's ancestors. Candle lanterns are floated out in Hirosawa Pond.\n\n\n== Learn ==\n1 Kyoto University (\u4eac\u90fd\u5927\u5b66 Ky\u014dto daigaku). One of Japan's most prestigious universities, second only to the University of Tokyo. Admissions are extremely competitive, though it may be easier for foreigners on exchange programmes. Colloquially known by the shortened form \u4eac\u5927 (Ky\u014ddai).   (updated Apr 2015)\n\n\n== Buy ==\nIndividual listings can be found in Kyoto's district articles\nThere is a nice selection of reassuringly non-tacky traditional souvenir shops around Arashiyama station in Western Kyoto, selling fans and traditional sweets. More tacky stores can be found in Gion and the approach to Kiyomizu Temple, selling keyrings, cuddly toys, and garish ornaments. Other traditional souvenirs from Kyoto include parasols and carved wooden dolls.\nMore unconventional but colorful (and relatively cheap) souvenirs are the wooden votive tablets produced by Shinto shrines, which bear an image relevant to the shrine on the reverse. Visitors write their prayers on the tablets and hang them up, but there's no rule that says you can't take it with you.\nManga and anime enthusiasts should visit Teramachi Street, a covered shopping street off the main Shijo-dori, which boasts a large manga store on two floors, as well as a two-story branch of Gamers (a chain of anime stores), and a small two-story anime and collectables store.\nMany ATMs in Kyoto do not allow non-domestic credit cards to be used, but ATMs in post offices and Seven-Eleven usually do. So if you find your card rejected or invalid in an ATM then try and get to a post office (\u90f5\u4fbf\u5c40 / yuubinkyoku or JP (in orange letters)) to use their ATMs instead. Look for the PLUS or Cirrus logos, whichever you find printed on the back of your ATM card. Another option is Citibank, which should work, too.  There is an old standby international ATM at the top floor of Takashimaya Department Store at Shijo/Kawaramachi in the \"Cash Corner.\"  The bank of ATMs in the basement of the Kyoto Tower shopping center (across the street from JR Kyoto Station) also includes one machine where international cards may be used.\n\n\n=== Splurge ===\nIn the shopping areas adjacent to Kiyomizudera (on the other side of the Kamo River), it is possible to purchase samurai swords and top-of-the-line kimono - though don't be surprised if the prices for either item exceed \u00a53,000,000. A brand new kimono can cost as much as a small car - and you may be able to find something just as good at a fraction of the price in one of Kyoto's second-hand kimono stores.\nKyoto incense is also famous. It usually has a very delicate yet fragrant bouquet.  Incense is relatively agreeable in price (\u00a5400-2000). You will be able to find it between Nishi and Higashi Hongwanji.\n\n\n=== Damascene ===\nDamascene, a special metal created by imbedding other metals, originated in Damascus, Syria over 2000 years ago and was introduced to Japan in the 8th century. Since then, it has ceased production worldwide with the exception of Kyoto city, which continues producing it today. The technique used to create Kyoto's damascene is quite complex, as it must be corroded, rusted, and boiled in tea, along with inlaying many layers of metal to produce the final product. Visitors can purchase a variety of jewelry, vases, tea utensils, lighters, and other accessories made using this technique.\n\n\n== Eat ==\nIndividual listings can be found in Kyoto's district articles\nSee also: Japanese cuisine\n\nIf you've just stepped off the train and the first thing on your mind is a bite to eat, there are several restaurants on the tenth and eleventh floors of the Isetan department store attached to Kyoto station. Most of the offerings are Japanese, including a veritable Ramen village, and there are a few casual Italian cafes.\n\n\n=== Fine dining ===\nIf you have a lot of money, Kyoto is considered by most Japanese to be the spiritual home of kaiseki (\u61d0\u77f3), which is a meal of many small courses and a quintessential type of Japanese fine dining; in Kyoto this will typically entail a private room with traditional Japanese architecture. Unfortunately, most kaiseki establishments do not accept reservations directly from foreigners, and many require new customers to be introduced by one of their regular diners in order to be allowed to dine there. Your hotel concierge may be able to make a reservation for you if you contact them well in advance, though only the most expensive luxury hotels have the necessary clout to do this. As with anywhere else in Japan, most fine dining establishments do not accept credit cards, and you will have to pay for your meal in cash.\nConsider staying at one of Kyoto's top ryokan; elaborate kaiseki dinners are an essential part of a stay in a ryokan, and there are numerous ryokan that are just as well known for their food as their lodging experience. The downside is that most ryokan only accept reservations by phone, so at least conversational Japanese-language ability is essential for you to be able to do so by yourself.\n\n\n=== Matcha ===\nKyoto and the nearby city of Uji are well known for matcha (\u62b9\u8336 maccha) or green tea, but visitors don't just come to drink the tea; there are a wide variety of matcha-flavored treats. Matcha ice cream is particularly popular, and most places selling ice cream will have it as an option. It also shows up in a variety of snacks and gifts. There is also the traditional Japanese tea ceremony (\u8336\u9053 sad\u014d) for those who want a unique experience.\n\n\n=== Yatsuhashi ===\n\nYatsuhashi (\u516b\u30c4\u6a4b or \u516b\u3064\u6a4b) is a delicious Kyoto snack, made from rice flour and sugar. There are three types of yatsuhashi: baked, raw, and raw with paste inside. The traditional hard yatsuhashi was originally made using cinnamon, and tastes like a crunchy biscuit. This is yatsuhashi in its narrowest sense. Today, while the biscuits remain the same, you can also buy hard yatsuhashi dipped in maccha and strawberry-flavored glazes. The simple raw type (nama-yatsuhashi) appeared in the 1960s.\nSoon after came the final evolution: raw yatsuhashi sandwiching sweet red bean paste. The explanatory name, (\u3042\u3093\u5165\u308a\u751f\u516b\u3064\u6a4b, an-iri nama-yatsuhashi), was too long for marketing purposes, so manufacturers began to call it in various trade names. The first to market was Otabe (\u304a\u305f\u3079). Other shops followed with Hijiri (\u8056), Yuko (\u5915\u5b50)  etc. This type is also made with cinnamon, but the cinnamon is mixed with bean paste and then folded into a triangle shape, somewhat like a gyoza. Today, you can buy a wide variety of flavors, including maccha, chocolate and banana, and black poppyseed. Many of the flavors are seasonal, such as the sakura (cherry blossom) yatsuhashi available in the spring and mango, peach, blueberry, and strawberry, available from May to October. This sandwich type became immensely popular and today the word yatsuhashi may well mean this type.\nAlthough yatsuhashi can be purchased at most souvenir shops, the best place to purchase raw yatsuhashi is the famous Honkenishio Yatsuhashi. While other stores may carry yatsuhashi, this is the place to find all of the seasonal flavors, as well as free samples. Most of these shops are in Higashiyama. The most convenient for tourists is probably the one on Kiyomizu-zaka, just below the entrance to Kiyomizu-dera.\nMany tourists find raw yatsuhashi to be a delicious (and very affordable) souvenir, but it only lasts for one week after purchase. Baked yatsuhashi on the other hand, will last for about three months.\n\n\n=== Other specialties ===\nOther Kyoto specialties include hamo (a white fish served with ume as sushi), tofu (try places around Nanzenji temple), suppon (an expensive turtle dish), kaiseki-ryori (multi-course chef's choice that can be extremely good and expensive), and vegetarian dishes (thanks to the abundance of temples), particularly the vegan sh\u014djin ry\u014dri, which isn't cheap, but has a great reputation for quality.\n\n\n== Drink ==\nIndividual listings can be found in Kyoto's district articles\nKyoto's night scene is dominated by bars catering for local needs, most of which are located in Central Kyoto around Kiyamachi, between Shijo and Sanjo. This area offers a wide variety of drinking options for all types of people. You'll also have no trouble finding the host and hostess bars, courtesy of the staff pacing around out front trying to entice visitors. There are plenty of options beyond this street in other regions, but with such a large concentration of bars along in the same area, it's easy to find a place where you feel most at home to relax for the night.\nIf you're looking for nightclubs, Kyoto has a few options, but it is not a city known for its thriving dance clubs. Those hoping to experience that part of Japanese nightlife should consider taking a train to Osaka where many of the clubs are hip and wild enough to rival any Tokyo club. (Alternately, instead of staying in Kyoto and making trips to Osaka, it may make more sense to stay in Osaka and make day trips to Kyoto.)\n\n\n=== Sake ===\nSome of Kyoto's most famous sake comes from Gekkeikan Brewery in the Fushimi area of Southern Kyoto. A 400-year-old brewery that still produces great sake, Gekkeikan also offers tours of its facilities.\n\n\n=== Whisky ===\nJapan's oldest whisky distillery, Yamazaki, is just across the prefectural border in Takatsuki, Osaka. Book ahead for factory and tasting tours.\n\n\n== Sleep ==\nIndividual listings can be found in Kyoto's district articles\n\nKyoto has a wide range of accommodation, much of it geared towards foreign visitors. During peak seasons, such as the cherry blossoms in April or during Golden Week when accommodation is difficult to get, consider staying in Osaka.  A 30-minute train ride from Kyoto Station to Osaka Station will cost you \u00a5540 one way.  Since Kyoto is a major tourist destination, demand is high and prices follow suit.\nMost of the lodging in the city is clustered near the central city, especially around Kyoto Station and the downtown area near Karasuma-Oike.  The outer areas have a scattering of their own, tending towards inexpensive but often much further from train or subway stations.\nFor those who would like to experience traditional Japanese accommodation, Kyoto is home to some of Japan's most luxurious ryokan, though prices are generally very expensive and would make economy-class plane tickets look cheap.\nThe city of Kyoto charges a hotel tax: for lodging that's less than \u00a520,000 per night, the tax is \u00a5200 per night. It may not be included in the listed rates. Starting in March 2026 the tax will be increasing under a multi-tiered system: Rooms under \u00a520,000 per night will be taxed at \u00a5400 per night (\u00a5200 for stays under \u00a56,000 per night), while more expensive accommodations will be charged a higher tax (up to \u00a510,000 per night for rooms costing at least \u00a5100,000 per night).\n\n\n=== Budget ===\n\nAt the bottom of the price scale, many temples in Kyoto own and run their own lodging complex known as shukub\u014d (\u5bbf\u574a), usually on or near temple grounds. Guests are often invited to participate in morning prayer service (otsutome) held at the temple. Unfortunately, most temple lodgings do not have English-speaking receptions, and curfews and check-in/out times tend to be strict.  Most are in the northern region of the city.\nHostels are common and popular with students.  Inexpensive hotels lack amenities but compensate with prices surprisingly low for Japan; both can be found in all regions of the city, and may be the only options available if you need to stay in an outlying ward.\nThe majority of self-named ryokan in this range are actually minshuku.  Most are small family-run operations and accustomed to dealing with foreigners.  Be prepared to pay for the full stay in advance.\n\n\n==== Internet and manga caf\u00e9s ====\nDon't fear these places. There is nothing bad about staying in these so-called \"last resorts.\" Remember, though, that most of the time people stay at such places only for a few nights at the most.\nAs in other Japanese cities, Internet caf\u00e9s and capsule hotels are available for those truly looking to stay on the cheap. Please expect to pay around \u00a52000 for a night's stay in an Internet caf\u00e9. You get a computer, a comfortable chair, and all the tea and hot chocolate you want.\nMost places have no separate space for smokers vis-\u00e0-vis non-smokers. Manga is usually only in Japanese. These places provide cushions, blankets, and free unlimited soft drinks. Showers are often available. However, there might be an additional charge for using a shower.\nCaf\u00e9s don't keep luggage during the day so either carry it with you every day, find free storage, or use a coin locker (which costs \u00a5300\u2013600 per use depending on the location and time duration). As a result, the cost of a night in a caf\u00e9 could be similar to a bed in a hostel but without identical amenities.\n\n\n=== Mid-range ===\nThe boundary between budget and midrange is often unclear, particularly among ryokan.  Hotels in this category are concentrated in Central Kyoto, serving the business market with the typical amenities and close proximity to transportation.\n\n\n=== Splurge ===\n\nSplit between the downtown and Higashiyama areas on each side of the Kamogawa River, these top-of-the-line lodgings can make your airfare look cheap.  Western-style hotels dominate in this category; unlike the midrange options, very few of the high end ryokan can be booked without a fluent command of Japanese.\n\n\n=== Machiya-stay ===\nIn Kyoto, there are traditional wooden townhouses called Kyo-Machiya or Machiya.\nKyo-Machiya defined the architectural atmosphere of downtown Kyoto for centuries, and represents the standard defining form of Machiya throughout the country.\nThere are several facilities offers those Machiya to the travellers to stay privately, and can experience the traditional living in Kyoto.\nMost of those facilities are located in central Kyoto that easy to access to any sightseeing spot.\nHowever, generally those facilities don\u2019t offer any meals, but in Kyoto, there is a delivery system from the Japanese restaurant that customer can order and eat in the Kyo-Machiya.\nDuring the guest stay, it is completely private that guests can feel like staying at their home.\nThe size of the facilities are average 80\u33a1, can stay from 2 people but it is better to use with group of 4 to 6, or with family.\nThere is a facility that guests can stay together in the same Machiya for up to 14 people.\nThe price starts at \u00a525,000.\n\n\n== Connect ==\nFree public Wi-Fi is available in many parts of Kyoto.\n\n\n== Go next ==\nUji - the best tea in Japan, the Byodo-in temple and the Nintendo Museum.\nLake Biwa - if the summer humidity has drained your will to sightsee, take a day swimming at the underrated beaches of western Lake Biwa.  Popular choices include Omi Maiko and Shiga Beach, each about 40 minutes from Kyoto on the JR Kosei Line.\nMount Hiei - an ancient hilltop temple complex that traditionally guarded (and occasionally raided) Kyoto.\nOtsu - home to some great historical temples, Mount Hiei, and one of Lake Biwa's ports.\nKoka - home of ninjas, and there is the Miho Museum.\nNara - less than an hour's journey by train on the JR Nara line from Kyoto station, Nara is an even older capital than Kyoto and has a stunning collection of temples in a giant landscaped park.\nOsaka - about half an hour from Kyoto by JR rapid train, this bustling city offers more retail opportunities and a central castle.\nAmanohashidate - literally \"the bridge to heaven\", it is considered one of Japan's top three scenic views (along with Matsushima in Miyagi prefecture and Miyajima in Hiroshima prefecture). It forms a thin strip of land straddling the Miyazu Bay in northern Kyoto Prefecture, hence the name. Visitors are asked to turn their backs toward the view, bend over, and look at it between their legs.\nHimeji - about an hour by Shinkansen west of Kyoto, Himeji boasts a spectacular traditional castle.\nSekigahara - about an hour northeast of Kyoto by train, Sekigahara is a small rural town of immense importance to the Japanese history buff, as this was the site of the battle that allowed Tokugawa Ieyasu to consolidate control of Japan and establish the Shogunate."

        "title": "Victoria Falls",
        "extract": "Victoria Falls is a town in the western portion of Zimbabwe, across the border from Livingstone, Zambia, and near Botswana. The town lies immediately next to the falls, and they are the major attraction, but this popular tourist destination offers both adventure seekers and sightseers plenty of opportunities for a longer stay.\n\n\n== Understand ==\nNo doubt about it, Mosi-oa-Tunya (meaning \"The Smoke That Thunders\") \u2013 but more commonly known as Victoria Falls \u2013 is one of the most amazing sights in the world. The Falls are twice as tall as Niagara Falls, and several times longer.  Although not the highest, widest or greatest volume of water, they have the largest sheet of water for any fall in the world, and are a sight not to be missed.\n\n\n=== History ===\nIt took thousands of years of erosion for Victoria Falls to appear as and where it does now. Mosi-oa-Tunya, or \"the smoke that thunders\u201d only became known to the western world as Victoria Falls after David Livingstone first set eyes on this astonishing natural wonder in 1855, a heartbeat ago in geological time.\nDuring the Jurassic Period (150-200 million years ago) volcanic activity resulted in thick basalt deposits covering large parts of Southern Africa. As the lava cooled and solidified, cracks appeared in the hard basalt crust, which were filled with softer clay and lime. About 2 million years ago, the land between Zimbabwe and the Kalahari Desert was lifted by the same series of earth movements that caused the Great African Rift Valley to the north. This blocked the flow of what was then the upper Limpopo River, which began to fill up a vast inland sea called Lake Makgadikgadi in the region of modern Botswana. This began to overflow in a new course over Zimbabwe's basalt plateau about 20,000 years ago.  Erosion by the mighty Zambezi River cut through the softer materials in the hard basalt, forming the first of a series of waterfalls. Over the last 20,000 years, the falls have receded 8 km upstream, as the Zambezi carved its way through seven linked gorges. This geological history can be seen in the dark basalt in the sheer rocky walls of gorges below the Falls. It is guessed that the Devil's Cataract, which is the lowest point of Victoria Falls, will eventually become the start of the next gorge as the river continues to cut its way back upstream.\nEssentially the river falls into a section of gorge along its northern side forming a waterfall a mile long.   You view the falls head on from across the gorge. \nVictoria Falls comprises eight ravines and several islands that house four endangered and migratory bird species, including the taita falcon and black eagle. Meanwhile, Victoria Falls\u2019 stunning spray mist which can be seen as far as 50km is a result of its lively ecosystem. \nThe newest waterfall can be found in Zimbabwe at The Devil\u2019s Cataract. In an aerial view of Victoria Falls, there is a great chance that there will be more waterfalls in the future.\n\n\n=== Border crossings ===\nTo cross the border from Zambia to see the falls on the Zimbabwe side you will need to pay at least US$30 for a Zimbabwe single entry visa (depending on nationality), and if you want to return to the Zambian side you will need to pay an extra US$20 for a multiple entry Zambian visa.  To cross the border from the Zimbabwean side to the Zambian side you will need to pay an at least US$20 for a single day Zambian visa, and at least an extra US$15 for a multiple entry Zimbabwean visa.  Don't forget, you will need to decide whether you are getting a single or multiple entry visa when you first apply for it.  If you are flying from South Africa just to see the falls, consider if it is worthwhile arriving on the Zimbabwean side and leaving from the Zambian, as you will minimise your visa costs this way (but may pay more for airfares).  Flying to the Zambian side usually costs less than flying into the Zimbabwe side.\nStill, for less than US$100 you can do both sides and tick another African country off your list.\n\n\n=== When to visit ===\n \nThe park is open year-round, but you will get a much different experience depending on the season in which you visit.\n\nIn the rainy season (November to March), the water volume will be higher, and the Falls will be more dramatic.  You are guaranteed to get wet if you cross the bridge or walk along the trails winding near the Falls.  On the other hand, it is precisely because the volume of water is so high that your viewing of the actual Falls will be obscured\u2014by all the water!\nIn the dry season, (April to October), the water volume will be lower, and by October Victoria Falls might just be a trickle. You will get a clearer view of the rocky ledge beneath the Falls, which is pretty spectacular, but the Falls might be somewhat underwhelming.\n\n\n== Get in ==\n\n\n=== By plane ===\n1 Victoria Falls Airport (VFA  IATA). British Airways and South African Airways offer daily flights between Johannesburg (JNB IATA) and Victoria Falls Airport. Air Zimbabwe also offers flights between Victoria Falls Airport and other destinations within Zimbabwe. Cheaper flights from South Africa are often available to neighbouring Livingstone. Kenya Airways have flights from Nairobi and Cape Town. Discover Airlines (Lufthansa's leisure airline) offers flights from Frankfurt, with a stop in Windhoek.   \n\n\n=== By train ===\nNational Railways of Zimbabwe service was suspended during the Covid-19 pandemic, and remains suspended as of July 2024.\nTrains from Zambia across the spectacular Zambezi Bridge have been suspended for a few years; however, catching a train to Livingstone and then continuing by taxi is a possibility.\n\n\n=== By car ===\nThe roads within Zimbabwe are relatively good.  The most direct way to Victoria Falls overland is from Bulawayo.  There is a good road network from the South African border at Beit Bridge right through to the Falls.\nIt's possible to drive in through Livingstone. Crossing an international border with a vehicle, however, will incur extra costs like carbon tax and insurance. Very annoying is the time consuming and disorganised procedure of obtaining a 'temporary import permit' for the car at the Zambian border posts. Once at the Zimbabwe border post, the whole procedure is to be repeated, though it is a bit faster but also expensive.\nComing from Namibia or Botswana, the best road is from Kasane in Botswana using the Kazungula border post which is about 70km from Victoria Falls.\n\n\n=== By bus ===\nBuses operated by Intercape ply the route between Windhoek in Namibia to Livingstone in Zambia three times a week. Notice that the bus stops on the Zambian side: You have to cross the border to Zimbabwe by foot or pick a taxi after crossing the Livingstone border post. A bus journey from Windhoek takes just over 14 hours and costs from R460.\nBuses operated by Intercape sometimes have a route between Bulawayo and Vic Falls.\nIntercape has the largest intercity route network in Southern Africa.\nThere are two new buslines going from Vic falls to Harare via Bulawayo Extra city and Bravo tours.\n\n\n== Get around ==\nIf you stay in the swanky hotels downtown, or even some of the budget accommodation options just outside the downtown area, walking is manageable. Most of the places are no more than 3 km away from Victoria Falls.\nSome of the hotels in Victoria Falls are not really in Vic Falls, but most of these have their own transfer services.\nCabs are plentiful, and should not cost more than $6 for a ride.\n\n\n== See ==\n\nThe obvious thing to see is of course the Victoria Falls, also known as Mosi-oa-Tunya (The Smoke That Thunders) and Shungu Namutitima (Boiling Water) in Lozi and Tonga languages respectively. Considered one of the seven natural wonder of the world. Watch and listen to the roar of 1088m\u00b3/second of water plunge into a 100m gorge below. The fall is shared by Zimbabwe and Zambia (the Zambian side is covered in the article for Livingstone). Both sides preserve the natural rainforest which is present because of the continuous spray from the falls.\n\n1 Victoria Falls National Park (Rainforest gate right by the Zimbabwe border post). 06:00-18:00. The main viewing area for the falls on the Zimbabwean side. Follow the winding path through the rainforest for several viewing angles of the falls as well as a statue of David Livingstone. Apart from the falls itself, visitors might see elephants. International Visitors: $50, SADC: $30.   (updated Jan 2021)\n2 Boiling Pot. Where the water goes after the falls. It can be seen beneath the Bridge or can be reached via a steep footpath within the park on the Zambian side, it is about 150 metres (500 ft) across. Its surface is smooth at low water, but at high water it is marked by enormous, slow swirls and heavy boiling turbulence. Objects and humans that are swept over the falls, including the occasional hippopotamus or crocodile, are frequently found swirling about here or washed up at the north-east end of the Second Gorge. This is where the bodies of Mrs Moss and Mr Orchard, mutilated by crocodiles, were found in 1910 after two canoes were capsized by a hippo at Long Island above the falls. (updated Jan 2021)\n3 Devil's Pool. Swim right up to the edge at the top of the Falls in a safe natural pool. You can look over the edge, and the guidges will take plenty of photos of you. As of July 2019, US$105 including breakfast, US$170 including lunch, and US$145 including high tea. Does not include visa or transfer. Transfer is US$15 return per person, or you could arrange it yourself for less. You could even walk it, but it's a long walk. (updated Jan 2021)\n4 Victoria Falls Bridge. Built in 1905 at the behest of Cecil Rhodes to carry the unfinished Cape to Cairo railway is an impressive steel arch which gives a glimpse of the falls from its centre. There are guided tours of the lower structure.   (updated Jan 2021)\n\n\n=== Other sights ===\n5 Jafuta Heritage Center. Small museum focused on cultural heritage of Shona, Ndebele, Tonga and Lozi people. (updated Jan 2021)\n6 The Big Tree. An ancient baobab tree estimated to be 2000 years old situated just out of town. It is possibly the oldest and biggest baobab in Zimbabwe. Get a cab there as the bush is full of wild animals.   (updated Jan 2021)\n\n\n== Do ==\nPrices for activities vary. As of July 2019 the company Wild Horizons appears to be the cheapest, but you will get cheaper prices by not going direct. Wild Horizons website\n\nBungee jumping, swing and zip wires rides take place from the bridge and the surrounding gorge. Price for a jump is $168 and for a combo $240.\nVisit the grand Victoria Falls Hotel for a magnificent view of the bridge. This first-class hotel has survived the country's woes, though it has lost its shine. The public areas and corridors are a museum of antique art, maps and photographs making it a kind of museum. You can eat there, including Afternoon Tea (see below).\nWhitewater rafting day trips sell for about $130 plus $10 National Park fees. The price includes a full day of shooting some of the best rapids in the world (including some Class V rapids!); lunch, eaten on the water and all the beer you can chug after the climb out.\nFrom wherever you stay you can easily arrange for a safari (prices vary), a sunset cruise (around $55), or a helicopter ride (for about $130 plus $8 National Park fee, well worth the price) over the falls.\nAn antique steam locomotive shunts railway carriages on to the bridge at sunset to enable fine dining with a view of the falls. This can be viewed from the trackside if you don't want to pay the high price. The British Empire era railway station is also worth a look, it has one train a day in each direction.\nThe Victoria Falls Safari Lodge has its Buffalo Bar which is quite simply the best spot to enjoy sundowners in Victoria falls. It is on a hill looking west towards a waterhole in the bush about 200 m away. At sunset see elephants and buffalo come to drink along with a wide range of smaller mammals and birds. Possibly the world's largest flying bird the, marabou stork also frequents the hole. Around noon the hotel also feeds leftover meat to the vultures, and hyenas sometimes turn up. Be prepared for the African bush squirrels to suddenly appear under your table. The hotel has an hourly free shuttle bus to town.\nThe Victoria Falls Safari Lodge and The Kingdom Hotel both have a casino on site.\nFor something different try an elephant ride ($130), or a lion walk ($130).\nThere are bush walking safaris and a horse-back safari offered by a variety of tour operators in town.\nIn town you can book a day trip to the nearby Chobe reserve in Botswana for US$150 (July 2019). The Kaza Univisa will allow you to return to Zimbabwe, but you will need to visit Zambia first as it is only available at the Zambian border.\nZambezi River above the falls, which is beautiful and full of wildlife. Best seen on a cruise, especially at sunset. Prices as of July 2019: breakfast cruise US$65, birdwatching cruise US$55, lunch cruise US$65, sunset cruise US$40, dinner cruise US$75.\n\n\n== Buy ==\nVictoria Falls is not cheap, especially if you want to do any activities.\nAs of April 2023, Zimbabwean ATMs dispense US dollars, the de facto currency of the country. Singles are difficult to come across but shops and restaurants can break the $100 notes from the ATM. In Zambia, you can withdraw kwacha and change to US dollars.\nYou will need cash for things like accommodation, and visas. For activities, you can pay by credit card in US$. Some of the supermarkets also accept credit cards and will bill you in US$. Outside Victoria Falls, foreign credit cards are rarely accepted.\nThere is substantial opportunity to shop in Victoria Falls, and you can find a good deal. The curio markets are just behind the post office and has dozens of tourist shops from which you may select wood and stone carvings, jewellery, t-shirts, curios, books, postcards, artwork, etc. (For fun, see if you can find the shop with the pictures of US Senator Hillary and Chelsea Clinton, from their visit.)\nTraders in the sculpture markets are prepared to barter trade: hats, your shoes, T-shirts, pens, batteries are in demand. But think twice before you reduce people to the level of beggars. Just negotiate what you think is a fair price.\n\n Stanbic Bank, 17-19 Phumula centre. 24 hours atm. mastercard visa card atm. (updated Oct 2022)\n Nedbank, shop 2 Sawanga Mall. 24 hours atm.. mastercard and visa card atm. (updated Aug 2023)\n\n\n== Eat ==\nThe centre has a few coffee shops, sandwich shops, and fast food options. For a few US dollars, you can feed an entire family.\nAll of the hotels have restaurants, and it is common to sample a new one each night. One place not to miss for a sundowner: The Victoria Falls Safari Lodge offers a-la-carte dinner, and the Boma offers an all-you-can-eat buffet dinner with authentic African dancing (US$45 excluding drinks, July 2019). The Ilala Lodge has a nice a la carte restaurant (a bit overpriced for the portions served; and the In-da-Belly Restaurant located in the camp site is a nice place to have simple meal and hang out at the pool and meet overland travellers from around the world.\nThere are Pick N Pay and OK supermarkets in town. Pick n Pay accept credit cards. Drinks and take-away food, snacks, camping supplies, are available.\n\nThe Boma\nMakuwa-Kuwa at the Victoria Falls Safari Lodge\nPalm Restaurant at Ilala Lodge\nLivingstone Room at the Victoria Falls Hotel\nJungle Junction at the Victoria Falls Hotel\nGarden of Eat'n - Great pizzas, breakfast and meals at Shoestring Backpackers Lodge\nThe restaurant at the Camp Site serves crocodile burgers and Warthog steak!\nRainforest Cafe in the Victoria Falls National Park.

Afternoon tea is served from 15:00-18:00 for US$15 each. They say \"minimum two people\" but don't enforce it. Stanley's Bar is by the terrace. Credit cards accepted. \n1 Lookout Caf\u00e9, \u260f +263 83 2840318. Splendid location overlooking the canyon below the falls including the bridge. The menu also includes regional specialties such as antelope and crocodile. It is not safe to walk in this area after sunset: use a car when going there for dinner. The access track forks from the main road to the bridge right before the falls car park. (updated Jul 2023)\n\n\n== Drink ==\nVictoria Falls is not known anymore for its tremendous nightlife. There are a few small bars near the  town centre, but they are not well-lit.  It might be fun to stop in, but be careful.\nThe River Brewing Co serves its own beer.\nAlternatively, all the hotels feature huge, well-stocked bars. However, the prices will be higher, and you might not feel that you are in Africa anymore.\n\n\n== Sleep ==\nPrice ranges quoted are in US dollars. \n\nThere are many types of accommodation in Victoria Falls. You can certainly find what you are looking for. Some of the accommodation options are not really in Victoria Falls so be careful, if booking in advance.\n\n\n=== Budget ===\nDorm beds from $15 a night.

A bit closer to town. \n3 The Victoria Falls Hotel, 1, Mallett Dr, \u260f +263 13 447519, reservationsl@victoriafallshotel.com. Built in 1904, this is one of the most romantic hotels in Africa with a faded grand old feeling to it. The Queen Mother herself stayed here when she visited. Views from the manicured lawns out to the railway bridge with the mist from the falls in the distance is surreal. \n4 Victoria Falls Safari Lodge, \u260f +263 13 43211-20, saflodge@saflodge.co.zw.

Located 80 km west of Victoria Falls, access is by transfer from Victoria Falls, Livingstone or Kasane. Imbabala offers not only the chance to unwind but also some of the most amazing game viewing and bird watching in the region, in the seclusion of a private National Parks concession. The 12,000 ha concession has 14 km of private Zambezi river frontage and borders the Chobe Forest Reserve, which is renowned for its massive Elephant population. Herds of up to 1500 elephants have been seen on the floodplains below the Lodge.\n\n\n== Services ==\nYou can get a haircut at the Victoria Falls Hotel salon, but it's not good. US$25, cash only. For other hair salons, turn off the main road by the Shearwater Cafe.\n\n\n== Stay safe ==\nYou can expect to be met by tourist police on your arrival in Victoria Falls.  They are plentiful around the town and the falls and can be trusted. You can identify them by their yellow vests.  Zimbabwe is very keen to keep tourists safe following a period of instability which saw visitors at risk, and tourists on the Zimbabwean side drop dramatically.  Sometimes it feels like there are more tourist police than tourists.\nIf you are staying at one of the resorts, it is likely that the guards at the resorts will keep an eye on you on the paths to the falls until you are within site of the tourist police.\nTouts are aggressive and desperate and best avoided.  They keep a distance from the tourist police and guards.  The markets are safe, and the traders there are very polite and keen for your trade.\nThe path along the side of the river to the Victoria Falls hotel from the falls is not safe to walk after dark.\n\n\n== Go next ==\nVictoria Falls is located within 100 km of the four corners of Zimbabwe, Zambia, Botswana and Namibia and thus provides access to all of these countries, but the only point of any note within a reasonable distance to the park is Chobe National Park in Botswana. It is a common destination, and most hotels will be able to book a journey on a day safari of one or two days.\n\nBulawayo"

        "title": "Los Angeles",
        "extract": "Frank Lloyd Wright is said to have quipped, \"Tip the world over on its side and everything loose will land in Los Angeles,\" a quote that has since been repeated both by those who love and hate L.A. The \"City of Angels\" is home to people who hail from all parts of the globe and an important center of culture, business, media, and international trade. However, it's most famous for being a major center of the world's television, motion picture, and music industry, which forms the base of the city's status and lures visitors for its show business history and celebrity culture. Visitors are also drawn to Los Angeles for its Mediterranean climate and numerous beaches, which gave birth to California's famed surf culture.\nCalifornia's most populous city and the second most populous city in the United States (after New York City), Los Angeles is spread across a broad basin in Southern California surrounded by vast forested mountain ranges, valleys, the Pacific Ocean, and nearby desert. Los Angeles sits at the heart of a metropolitan area of over 18 million people that spreads across Los Angeles County, Orange County, Ventura County, and the Inland Empire region of San Bernardino County and Riverside County.\n\n\n== Districts ==\nFor travel purposes, this article covers the entirety of Los Angeles County, a region of nearly 5,000 square miles in Southern California (roughly the same size as Rhode Island). There are 88 cities (municipalities) in the county; the largest, the city of Los Angeles, spreads throughout the county from the Port of Los Angeles to the San Fernando Valley.\n\n\n=== Central Los Angeles ===\n\n\n=== Los Angeles County regions ===\n\n\n== Understand ==\n\n\n=== Geography ===\nThe city of Los Angeles is huge, stretching from the suburbs of the San Fernando Valley in the north to the Port of Los Angeles in the south, a distance of almost 50 mi (80 km). And that's just the primary city; the sprawling L.A. metropolitan area spreads across portions of five counties and includes numerous smaller cities, some of which are regional centers of their own, like Burbank, Pasadena, Long Beach, Anaheim, Santa Ana, Riverside and San Bernardino. Some of these cities were founded around the end of the nineteenth century and grew alongside Los Angeles, and even today retain distinct identities.\nSuch is the nature of Los Angeles: because it is so spread out and its individual cities and neighborhoods are so distinct, the city is often thought of less as a cohesive whole than as a collection of disparate communities. Even some of the neighborhoods officially within the city of Los Angeles are so well-known that they are often thought to be distinct from the city, such as Hollywood, Van Nuys, Bel-Air, and Venice Beach, which sit astride officially independent municipalities such as West Hollywood, Santa Monica, and Beverly Hills.\nMost of the city sits in a broad basin that stretches from Santa Monica along the shoreline across the southern portion of the county and into Orange County. The basin is the most intensely developed part of the region, with a strong grid pattern of streets and freeways that's evident from the air. This basin is framed on the north by the Santa Monica Mountains, which gradually soften into a series of hills as they run east past Hollywood and Downtown L.A. and through East L.A. On the other side of these hills are two heavily developed valleys, the San Fernando Valley to the northwest of Central L.A. and the San Gabriel to the east, which today are filled with suburban neighborhoods. North of the valleys are the steep San Gabriel Mountains, which reach a high enough elevation that their peaks are sometimes coated with snow in the winter. Beyond this lies the Mojave Desert.\n\n\n=== History ===\nPrior to European contact, the Los Angeles basin was occupied by the native Tongva people, a set of hunter-gatherer tribes that were spread across much of Southern California. Portuguese explorer Juan Cabrillo was the first European to visit the region, sailing along the coast in 1542 and claiming the land for the Spanish Empire, but it took over two hundred years for the first Spanish settlement to be established, with the construction of the Mission San Gabriel by Franciscan missionaries in 1771. Ten years later, a group of Spanish settlers known as \"Los Pobladores\" (\"the townspeople\") founded a small village, El Pueblo de Los Angeles, at the site of the present-day El Pueblo district near Downtown.\nLos Angeles remained a small ranch town for several decades, passing to Mexican and then to American rule in 1847 in the wake of the Mexican\u2013American War. Los Angeles was immediately turned into a boomtown with the completion of railroads to the region, first the Southern Pacific Railroad from the north in 1876 and then the Santa Fe Railroad from the east in 1885, establishing the city as a railroad hub of the west. At the same time, city boosters sought to establish port and industrial facilities to challenge San Francisco's dominance on the west coast. Intense real estate speculation and low railroad fares attracted many \"folks\" from the Midwest and East Coast with warm winters and good job prospects. The discovery of oil in the basin and the completion of an aqueduct to provide a steady supply of water only accelerated the city's growth.\nFilmmakers began arriving in the 1900s, lured by the area's climate and varied scenery, but also to flee Thomas Edison's litigious motion picture company, whose patents weren't enforced in the west. D.W. Griffith was the first to film a motion picture in the city, heralding the arrival of Hollywood. Soon, the vast majority of the world's film industry was concentrated in Los Angeles, making the city known throughout the world. Los Angeles continued to grow, drawing waves of job seekers during the Great Depression, and by the 1940s had the largest streetcar network in the world. World War II turned the city into a major center of wartime manufacturing, with Los Angeles briefly serving as the aviation center of the nation.\nAfter World War II, Los Angeles sprawled out even further with the rise in popularity of the automobile and the concurrent expansion of the freeway system. This hastened the decline of the expansive streetcar network; in fact many of the city\u2019s major arterials follow previous streetcar lines such as Wilshire Boulevard, San Vincente Boulevard, and the Glendale freeway. This turned Los Angeles into the car-centric city it is today, with its infamous traffic jams and sprawling medium-to-low density population. Inequitable urban planning policies contributed to white flight and created racially segregated neighborhoods in much of the central, south central, gateway, and north east regions of the city. The 1960s saw racial tensions erupt with the Watts Riots, and again in 1992 with the Rodney King riots. Nevertheless, the population of the city continued to grow, drawing a remarkable diversity of immigrants from throughout the Pacific Rim and Latin America.\nSince the early 1990s, the city has seen a decrease in crime and renewed investment in urban development and revitalization. Much of the manufacturing industry has moved elsewhere, but the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach are now the largest harbor complex in the nation, handling much of the United States' imported goods. After decades of underinvestment, the city's public transit system has seen massive expansion and improvement bolstered by popular support for several countywide ballot measures to fund new construction. America's entertainment industry remains largely headquartered in Los Angeles, and between the warm weather and attractions both new and old, the city continues to draw people from around the world. In 1994, the magnitude 6.7 Northridge earthquake shook the city, causing $12.5 billion in damage and 72 deaths. In 2002, Mayor James Hahn led the campaign against secession, resulting in voters defeating efforts by the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood to secede from the city. In 2022, voters elected Karen Bass as the city's first female mayor, making Los Angeles the largest US city to have ever elected a woman as mayor. Los Angeles will host the 2028 Summer Olympics and Paralympic Games, making Los Angeles the third city to host the Olympics three times.\n\n\n=== People ===\nLos Angeles is a very diverse city with much of its population being born outside the United States. The city has the third largest Mexican population in the world, behind the Mexican cities of Mexico City and Guadalajara, the largest Iranian population outside of Iran, and is home to about a dozen other large immigrant populations, many with their own little enclaves of restaurants, shops, and places of worship; some prominent examples include Chinatown and Little Tokyo in the Downtown area, Koreatown, the Little Armenia district of East Hollywood, and Iranian, Indian, Pakistani, and Japanese enclaves in West L.A. On the south side of the county, Long Beach has a very diverse population while Carson is noted for its large Samoan population.\nThe Latino population is spread throughout the city, but is still most heavily concentrated in East L.A. South Central L.A. remains the African-American center of the city, even while experiencing an increase in the Hispanic population. Prominent gay communities can be found in West Hollywood, as well as the Silver Lake neighborhood and the broader Westside area.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nThe city enjoys a temperate Mediterranean climate most of the year. However, the climate of Southern California is somewhat complex and temperatures can fluctuate wildly depending where you are in the city, since the varied terrain results in a series of microclimates. On the same day, daytime highs can vary by as much as twenty degrees Fahrenheit between coastal locations and cities in the San Fernando and San Gabriel Valleys. The coast tends to stay a bit cooler, which helps with the summer heat, but as such is also chillier at night. Bring a sweater and pants if you stay for dinner near the coast, even in the summer.\nSummers are warm, occasionally hot, and bring the infamous dirty smog, though the air quality has significantly improved over the years. In August and September, the hottest months, average daytime highs in Downtown Los Angeles are 83\u00b0F (28\u00b0C) and nighttime lows average 63\u00b0F (17\u00b0C). Winters are mild and bring much of the annual rainfall; between December and March average daytime highs are 68\u00b0F (20\u00b0C) and nighttime lows are 49\u00b0F (9\u00b0C). Spring is a mix of gloomy rainy days and warm sunny days; like the rest of Southern California, L.A. experiences the \"May Gray\" and \"June Gloom\" marine effect, which results in frequent fog and overcast skies along the coast, so don't expect sunny beach weather if you visit during these months. Fall is typically warm and dry, with frequent wildfires. Ocean temperatures along the L.A. coast vary from an average of 58\u00b0F (14\u00b0C) in January to 68\u00b0F (20\u00b0C) in August.\nSanta Ana winds can occur at any time of the year, although they most commonly occur in the fall and winter. These winds are a reversal of the usual climate conditions, when hot, dry air blows from the desert to the coast. Milder Santa Ana winds can result in excellent dry air conditions, but powerful ones can last days on end, significantly raising temperatures, creating tremendous fire danger, and in general making life miserable.\n\n\n=== Watch ===\nSee also: Fiction tourism#Films\nLos Angeles is intimately tied to the history of the movies, given its place as the de facto headquarters of the film industry for almost a century now. As such, L.A. has served as a prominent backdrop in virtually every genre of film, from gritty noir and psychological thrillers to light-hearted romantic comedies and action-packed blockbusters. Whittling down the countless number of movies set in L.A. to a manageable list of the very best is a difficult task, and one rife with debate, but there are a few that consistently stand out for their place in L.A. mythos or for capturing some essential essence of the city that lies beyond the studio gates.\n\nLos Angeles Plays Itself (Thom Andersen, 2003). If you want to understand this city's relationship with the film industry and Hollywood's outlook on its adopted city, this documentary is a good place to start. Andersen's withering commentary underlines the tension that exists between locals and their city's most famous industry, set to a visual smorgasbord of clips from other movies that illustrate what Hollywood captures\u2014and more importantly, what it fails to capture.\nSunset Boulevard (Billy Wilder, 1950). Perhaps the definitive Hollywood movie about Hollywood, Billy Wilder's iconic classic follows a down-on-his-luck screenwriter who gets sucked into the delusions of a silent film star long past her prime.\nKiss Me Deadly (Robert Aldrich, 1955). A noir classic, this grim tale involves a thuggish private eye who takes a twisting journey through L.A. after his fateful decision to pick up a hitchhiker. Marvelous cinematography of the city abounds, from nightclubs and dark winding roads to the soon-to-be-demolished tenements of Bunker Hill.\nRebel Without a Cause (Nicholas Ray, 1955). In James Dean's most celebrated performance, an angst-ridden teenager passes from one now-iconic Los Angeles set-piece to the next, including a tragic game of chicken at a Palos Verdes cliff and a wild climax outside the Griffith Observatory.\nFar from the glamour of Hollywood, there's a set of fairly obscure but beloved neo-realist films noted for capturing a side of L.A. rarely seen, offering an intimate portrayal of life in the city's margins and a glimpse into the city's past. The Exiles (Kent MacKenzie, 1961) follows a group of young Native Americans living and partying in Downtown, with gorgeous cinematography of many places now lost to time. Killer of Sheep (Charles Burnett, 1978) is a wandering yet strikingly warm and tender view of the African American communities of 1970s Watts, while Bless Their Little Hearts (Billy Woodberry, 1984) is a poignant yet bleak look at a Watts working class family struggling to make ends meet.\nChinatown (Roman Polanski, 1974). This neo-noir flick has probably done more to shape Los Angeles' image of its past than the actual history its loosely based on. A seemingly routine case of proving adultery draws a rakish private detective into a vast conspiracy over stolen water, shady land deals, and lives ruined to cover up the sins of city leaders.\nBlade Runner (Ridley Scott, 1982). While Ridley Scott's dystopian Los Angeles bears little resemblance to the real thing, no discussion of L.A.'s depiction in film is complete without mentioning it. Critical opinion of this sci-fi noir is decidedly mixed, but many local landmarks make appearances as striking ruins, from Union Station to Los Feliz's Ennis House to Downtown's Bradbury Building.\nBoyz n the Hood (John Singleton, 1991). Released just one year prior to the Rodney King riots, this somber coming-of-age film is emblematic of the hood genre, depicting teenage life in South Central and the desperate struggle to escape the ghetto.\nThe Player (Robert Altman, 1992). Robert Altman's comeback film is a loving and humorous\u2014if slightly dark\u2014satire of Hollywood, rife with inane studio executives, obsessive screenwriters, and too many celebrity cameos to count.\nFalling Down (Joel Schumacher, 1993). William Foster (played by Michael Douglas) suffers a mental break and sets out on a violent rampage across the city to reach his ex-wife's house to celebrate his daughter's birthday, spreading chaos in his wake.\nSpeed (Jan de Bont, 1994). Many of the biggest action blockbusters of the time are set in L.A. (Die Hard, Terminator, Lethal Weapon, etc.), but few so lovingly show off Los Angeles as this goofy, relentless, and fun action flick about a bus that will explode if it drives too slow.\nL.A. Confidential (Curtis Hanson, 1997). An acclaimed neo-noir flick set in the 1950s, this cynical film juxtaposes Hollywood's glamorous image with its sordid underworld of corrupt cops, organized crime, prostitution, and media scandals, with certain real-world figures and events cropping up in the film's margins.\nQuentin Tarantino's highly influential first three films, Reservoir Dogs (1992), Pulp Fiction (1994), and Jackie Brown (1997), are all set in L.A. and make fantastic use of the decidedly non-glamorous side of the city, from its hole-in-the-wall diners and run-down apartments to its sun-baked streets and seedy pawn shops. Tarantino's film, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019), is a fictionalized version of the L.A. of 1969.\nThe Big Lebowski (Joel and Ethan Coen, 1998). A cult favorite, the Coen Brothers' madcap adventure bounces between the weird and wacky characters that make up L.A.'s fringe culture: slackers, nihilists, fascist cops, radical artists, porn kings, and the worlds that they inhabit. Fans of the Coen Brothers should also check out their 1991 flick Barton Fink, a surreal period piece about a New York playwright who moves to Hollywood.\n\n\n=== Visitor information ===\n Los Angeles Visitor Information Center (Hollywood), 6801 Hollywood Blvd (in the Hollywood and Highland Center; Metro: Hollywood/Highland), \u260f +1-323-467-6412. \n\n\n== Get in ==\n\n\n=== By plane ===\nSee also: Air travel in the United States\nThe Los Angeles metro area is served by five major commercial airports and more than a dozen private airports. Three of the major airports are in L.A. County proper while the other two are nearby.\n\nLos Angeles International Airport (LAX IATA), 1 World Way, +1-310-646-5252. LAX is one of the major ports of entry for international flights to the United States as well as a major destination for domestic flights so it can be quite busy, especially around holidays. Nearly all major airlines as well as some smaller regional airlines fly into LAX. All of the major rental car agencies have a location near the airport with hundreds of cars available for rent. Many connecting bus routes have service to destinations all over Southern California.\nHollywood Burbank Airport (BUR IATA), 2627 N Hollywood Way, Burbank, +1-818-840-8840. Has a range of flight options, mainly to Western U.S. destinations and some east coast cities. Located in the San Fernando Valley, northeast of Downtown L.A, it's closer to Hollywood and Downtown Los Angeles than LAX is. To reach Hollywood, take a free shuttle to the North Hollywood Red Line subway station and ride 2 stops south. To get to Downtown LA, take Metrolink/Amtrak train or the Red Line.\nLong Beach Airport (LGB IATA), 4100 Donald Douglas Dr., Long Beach, +1 562 570-2600. Delta, Hawaiian, and Southwest fly into this airport located in southern Los Angeles County.\nOntario International Airport (ONT IATA), 1940 East Moore Way, Ontario in adjacent San Bernardino County, Inland Empire, +1 909 937-2700. Alaska, American, Avianca El Salvador, China Airlines, Delta, JetBlue, Hawaiian, Southwest, United and Volaris serve this airport located 37 mi (59 km) east of Downtown Los Angeles, about a 40-minute drive without traffic. Omnitrans #61 bus runs to the Pomona Transit Center, with a connection to the Silver Streak to Downtown LA or the ONTConnect bus (Omnitrans #380) to the Rancho Cucamonga Metrolink Station.\nJohn Wayne Airport (SNA IATA), 18601 Airport Way, Santa Ana in adjacent Orange County, +1 949 252-5200. Alaska, Allegiant, American, Breeze Airways, Delta, Frontier, Southwest, Spirit, United, and WestJet serve this airport located 40 mi (64 km) southeast of Downtown Los Angeles, about a 45-minute drive without traffic. Closest airport for Disneyland and Knotts Berry Farm.\nLAX has historically been the main airport for the city, with frequent service and low fares, but the other regional airports are seeing increasing service. Check as one of them may be better, depending on your circumstance. These airports can save a lot of hassle because they are less busy than LAX. Also, the L.A. area is so wildly spread out and populated that going anywhere will generally require a lot of travel, as well as possibly enduring traffic jams. So using the nearest airport will only be of convenience to you.\nAll five airports lack direct train services; only the Bob Hope Airport is somewhat proximate to a Metrolink commuter rail station (not to be confused with the Metro Rail service). LAX has a comfortable, fast, and relatively frequent express bus service, the LAX FlyAway, to Union Station (in Downtown) and Van Nuys. LAX does not cater to small general aviation; Burbank (ICAO: KBUR) does, but is considered high-traffic for this type of flight; Long Beach (ICAO: KLGB) does, but has a very complicated runway system and, again, is considered high traffic. General aviation will fare much better at L.A. area airports that do not handle commercial flights at all. Much of Los Angeles is Class Bravo or other controlled airspace, but due to the number of airports and the generally good weather, Los Angeles makes a fantastic flying destination.\nPrivate pilots will prefer smaller general aviation airports such as Van Nuys (ICAO: KVNY), one of the world's busiest private jet airports, as well as Hawthorne, or any of the other small airports in the area that do not handle commercial flights; Santa Monica (ICAO: KSMO) reduced their runway length to restrict aircraft size to smaller planes. Air taxi and air charter companies including Los Angeles Private Jets can access private aircraft at any of L.A.'s private aviation airports, as well as planes in your area for flights to Los Angeles.\n\n\n=== By car ===\nSeveral major freeways enter the Los Angeles region. Interstate 5 is the primary north/south freeway through Central L.A., heading south to the Mexican border through Orange County and San Diego, and heading north through the San Joaquin Valley to Sacramento, continuing on through the Pacific Northwest before eventually reaching Canada. From the south, Interstate 405 splits off from I-5 in Orange County and is a more direct route to Long Beach, the South Bay, and the Westside, so long as you don't travel during rush hour. From the north, I-5 is the most direct option from the San Francisco Bay Area (linked to I-5 by I-580), while U.S. Highway 101 is the most direct option from California's Central Coast.\nFrom the east, Interstate 10 is the primary road into the region, heading east from L.A. through the Inland Empire and the California desert (via Palm Springs) before crossing through into Arizona and continuing across Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi and the Florida panhandle to Jacksonville, FL.\nAnd while they don't directly connect to Los Angeles proper, Interstates 15 and 40 are important links from the north and east. I-15 runs north/south through the Inland Empire (where you can connect to several freeways to L.A. proper), continuing north through Nevada and Utah (via Las Vegas and Salt Lake City) and heading on through the Rocky Mountains (Idaho and Montana) to the Canadian border. I-40 is one of the nation's primary east-west road links, cutting a long route across the middle of the country. In California, I-40 terminates at I-15 in the town of Barstow; from there, follow I-15 south into the Inland Empire and connect from there to Los Angeles.\nIf driving into or through the L.A. area, be sure to make note of when you'll be arriving so as to try to avoid one of the area's notorious traffic jams. See the Get around section below for more detailed info on getting around L.A. by car.\n\n\n=== By train ===\nSee also: Rail travel in the United States\n\n1 Union Station, 800 N. Alameda St (next to the Hollywood Freeway (US-101) in downtown Los Angeles).   (updated Oct 2023) The station is a spectacular example of Mission Revival architecture, with a spacious waiting room and courtyards with outdoor seating, as well as some eating and shopping establishments on-site. It's also well connected to L.A.'s public transit system, with a Metro Red/Purple Line subway station (in the basement), a Metro Gold Line light rail station (on platforms 1 and 2, parallel to the Amtrak and Metrolink trains), and the adjacent Patsaouras Bus Plaza (at the east portal of the station) which serves many local buses and LAX Flyaway shuttles to Los Angeles International Airport. A Budget and Hertz rental car desk is also located in the station; more rental car options are available at LAX.\nUnion Station is patrolled by private security staff and people lingering too long in the seats may be asked to show a ticket. Taxis are available at the main entrance off Alameda Street and the station is within short walking distance to the Civic Center and Olvera Street. Chinatown and Little Tokyo are also nearby. Be warned that it can get uncomfortable in the station especially when it is hot and/or there are a lot of people. Free guided tours of Union Station are available on the 2nd Sunday of each month. No reservations are required; tours begin at 10:30AM at the information booth inside the Alameda Street entrance.\nUnion Station is the region's primary train station and has the best public transit connections, but there are several other Amtrak stops within the region that may be better located to your destination, namely in the Inland Empire, Orange County, and the San Fernando Valley. L.A. is massive, so make sure you get the right stop.\n  Amtrak, \u260f +1 215-856-7924, toll-free: +1-800-872-7245. Operates train service around the United States of America.   (updated Mar 2022) Routes stopping at Union station:\n\nCoast Starlight operates daily between Seattle and Los Angeles. Stops include Tacoma, Lacey, Centralia, Kelso, Vancouver, WA, Portland, Salem, Albany, Eugene, Klamath Falls, Dunsmuir, Redding, Chico, Sacramento, Davis, Martinez, San Francisco (Emeryville), Oakland, San Jose, Salinas, Paso Robles, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Oxnard, Simi Valley, Van Nuys, and Burbank. It shares the same route as the Pacific Surfliner (see below) between Los Angeles and San Luis Obispo, but with fewer stops.\nThe Pacific Surfliner runs many trains daily between San Diego and Los Angeles, with some trains traveling north to Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo. There are several stops in the San Fernando Valley (it shares a route with the Coast Starlight but stops at more stations) and in Orange County.\nThe Southwest Chief runs daily to Chicago via Fullerton, Riverside, San Bernardino, Victorville, Barstow, Needles, Grand Canyon (at Williams/Williams Jct and Flagstaff); Albuquerque and Kansas City.\nThe Sunset Limited runs three times a week out to New Orleans via Pomona, Ontario, Palm Springs, Yuma, Tucson, El Paso and San Antonio. Additionally, Amtrak's Texas Eagle service between San Antonio and Chicago incorporates the Sunset Limited to provide a direct connection to Los Angeles.\nThe San Joaquin from Fresno and Sacramento goes no further than Bakersfield (about 115 mi (185 km) to the north). However, coordinated bus travel to Union Station on a single ticket is available from Amtrak. From the San Joaquin Valley (also known as the Central Valley), this is the only option available that involves any train service. Since the track is generally west of the State Route 99 freeway, it serves different cities than the Greyhound bus line.\nAmtrak California Thruway Buses operate buses between the San Joaquins train in Bakersfield (see above) and multiple locations (including Union Station) in the Los Angeles and Long Beach areas on multiple routes. Tickets for the Amtrak Thruway buses are included as part of the train tickets and cannot be sold as \"bus only\" tickets. See this link for the coastal Thruway connections in conjunction with the Pacific Surfliner route.\n\n Metrolink is an extensive regional train network with rail lines radiating out from Union Station to surrounding suburbs and counties, stretching as far as Perris, Lancaster, Oceanside, San Bernardino, and Oxnard.\nSeveral Metrolink lines overlap Amtrak's routes or serve the same cities via a slightly different routing, and Metrolink tickets tend to cost significantly less than Amtrak tickets. Metrolink frequency varies between lines, with service dropping considerably during the weekend; Amtrak's Pacific Surfliner runs far more frequently on the weekends and always runs later in the day than overlapping Metrolink trains.\nFares are based on how far you travel, falling in the range of $5-$15 for one-way fares. Tickets must be bought from vending machines on the platform, and are checked by fare inspectors on board. Metrolink tickets also cover free travel on many connecting local transit systems, including L.A. Metro, where a Metrolink ticket effectively works as a day pass for the date stamped on your ticket. If you're thinking of using Metrolink to day trip on the weekend, you'll want to get the $10 weekend day pass, which is good for unlimited travel on Metrolink (and connecting transit) on either Saturday or Sunday.\n\n\n=== By bus ===\nSee also: Long-distance bus travel in the United States\nMost of the buses are routed to Los Angeles from San Francisco Bay Area (via Santa Cruz, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara and/or Oxnard); Sacramento (via Modesto, Stockton, Merced and/or Bakersfield); Las Vegas (via Barstow, San Bernardino); Phoenix; and Tijuana (via San Ysidro, San Diego, and/or Santa Ana) with multiple companies.\nThe majority of the intercity bus stations and stops for the greater Los Angeles area are located in \"Skid Row\" east of downtown Los Angeles, Union Station, El Monte, Huntington Beach, east L.A.

Some of the same companies also have additional stops or depots in other areas throughout Greater Los Angeles, so check the company's website to see if there is a stop closer to your destination. When traveling to/from the bus station in the infamous \"skid-row\" it's recommended to use taxi or rideshare (Uber, Lyft, etc) as the surrounding area has become even less safe:\n\n Autobus Coordinados de Nayrit (ACN), US Eagle Travel Agency at 4425 E Olympic Blvd (E Olympic Blvd & S Marianna), \u260f +52 664 229-0487, toll-free: 01800 026-73-73.

Most prominent neighborhoods and sightseeing destinations can be reached using Metro Rail, including Downtown L.A., Koreatown, Hollywood, Universal Studios, Chinatown, Pasadena, Exposition Park, Wilshire, Culver City, Santa Monica, and Long Beach. For these areas, public transportation can be preferable to the gridlock that often occurs on freeways and streets.\nThe Metro Rail system consists of two subway lines, four light rail lines, and two bus rapid transit lines, with operating hours and frequencies varying from one line to another. Note that in 2022 lines were given letters instead of names, but the names are still in colloquial use.\n\nSubway service is provided by the  B  and  D  Lines, with the  B  running from Downtown to Hollywood, then to Universal City and North Hollywood in the San Fernando Valley, while the  D  connects Downtown to Koreatown. In Downtown, these lines overlap with a terminus at Union Station; check the train's destination signs to make sure you are on the right train.  D  Line trains outside of rush hour are only two cars in length and will not fill the length of the station; signs on the platform will help guide you to where the train will stop. Due to the traffic along the 101 freeway, it's usually faster to take the  B  Line between Hollywood and Downtown than to drive.\nThe  A  Line light rail service runs between Azusa and Long Beach through South Central Los Angeles, with a stop convenient to the Watts Towers. The  E  Line light rail service runs from East Los Angeles through Downtown Los Angeles to the University of Southern California and the museums of Exposition Park before turning west to Culver City and Santa Monica. In Downtown, these two lines overlap for a segment that includes the 7th St/Metro Center Station, where you can transfer to the  B  and  D  Lines; check the train's destination signs to make sure you are on the right train. Note that only the  A  Line serves Union Station.\nThe  C  Line is one of two light rail lines that doesn't serve Downtown, running east-west along Interstate 105 on the southern side of L.A. between LAX and Norwalk, with a transfer point to the  A  Line at Willowbrook/Rosa Parks Station in South Central L.A.\nThe  K  Line is the other of two light rail lines that doesn't serve Downtown, running north-south from the  E  Line at Crenshaw to Redondo Beach via Inglewood and LAX.\nThere are also two bus rapid transit (BRT) lines which use bus-only roadways. The  G  Line runs across the San Fernando Valley between Chatsworth (with a connection to Amtrak's Pacific Surfliner) and the terminus of the Red Line in North Hollywood. The  J  Line runs between El Monte (in the San Gabriel Valley) and San Pedro through Downtown, and requires an extra surcharge in addition to the standard Metro fare.\nThere is no direct rail connection between Downtown Los Angeles and LAX, but a free shuttle to the airport terminals is available from the Aviation/LAX Station on the  C  Line. A people mover connecting the airport to the  K  Line is scheduled to open in 2026. Until then, a much more convenient option is the direct LAX FlyAway shuttle service, which serves the airport directly from Union Station.\nDistinct from Metro is the Metrolink regional rail system, which radiates out from Union Station to many surrounding suburbs and counties. Metrolink does not accept Metro passes, but Metrolink tickets are honored as a day pass on Metro Rail and buses for the date stamped on the ticket, and are compatible with the TAP system. More detailed info on Metrolink can be found in the By train section above.\n\n\n==== By bus ====\nThe main bus system in Los Angeles is operated by Metro (+1-800-COMMUTE, or +1-800-266-6883). Many Angelenos without a car use the bus as their primary mode of transportation. There is a preponderance of frequent bus service along major north-south and east-west corridors radiating to the south and west from Downtown Los Angeles.\nService frequencies are fairly high along major streets in the L.A. basin; in general you won't wait more than 15-20 minutes for a bus. \"Rapid\" buses run more frequently than local ones and should be used when possible, given that L.A. is so huge that you'll much prefer riding buses which only stop at major intersections to ones that stop nearly every block. Check the schedules in advance as many routes change and have reduced frequency in the late hours.\nAn oddity of L.A. public transit is that there are numerous bus transit agencies, which almost always require paying an additional fare if you transfer between agencies. LADOT's DASH shuttles circulate around Downtown L.A., Hollywood and various Los Angeles neighborhoods. Santa Monica's Big Blue Bus system provides service in that city as well as linking Santa Monica with Westside L.A. districts (such as Brentwood, Westwood, and Venice Beach), Downtown L.A., and LAX. The Culver CityBus operates buses in and around Culver City and UCLA. Areas of the San Gabriel Valley east of El Monte are served by Foothill Transit. Montebello Bus Lines operates service in Montebello, Pico Rivera, Whittier, East LA, and surrounding communities. Long Beach Transit provides service in and around Long Beach while the city of Torrance have their own set of buses with Torrance Transit.\nFor service from Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), the LAX FlyAway bus is the most convenient bus service to Downtown L.A. and Van Nuys; see the LAX page for details.\n\n\n==== Public transit payment ====\nAnyone looking to use public transit in L.A. would benefit from getting a TAP card, an electronic reusable fare card which can be loaded with transit passes or cash value. A TAP card is required for entry into the Metro Rail system. TAP cards can be purchased from vending machines in Metro Rail stations, certain vendors, online from the TAP website, or at Metro Customer Centers (the main one being at Union Station). TAP cards can also be purchased from a Metro bus driver (exact change required), but only with a day pass loaded on the card. New TAP cards incur an extra fee of $1 if bought from a vending machine or a Metro bus driver, and $2 from any other source. If you have an iPhone, a digital TAP card can be loaded onto your phone's wallet for no extra charge.\nMetro fare payment works on a proof-of-payment system. When entering a bus, tap your card on the blue TAP sensor at the front door. At Metro Rail stations, there will be card sensors as you approach the platform. If transferring to another Metro Rail train, you will also have to tap at the station where you change trains, at the sensors marked \"Must Tap to Transfer.\" Remember to tap once for every vehicle you enter, as Metro police randomly check cards for valid fare on vehicles or station platforms, and they are noted for being rather aggressive in their fare enforcement; the penalty for not being able to show valid fare is $250 and up to 48 hours of community service. At certain stations, you may also need to tap your card to exit the system.\nA single-trip fare on Metro costs $1.75 and includes a two-hour transfer to other Metro rail and bus lines. On Metro buses, you can also pay with cash (exact change only), but you won't get the two-hour transfer that you would using a TAP card. Fares are subject to a fare cap of $5 a day or $18 a week, beyond which the rest of your rides are free.\nTAP cards are also good on all of the other bus transit agencies in the county; stored cash value on your card is good for fares on any participating agency. If transferring from Metro to another bus agency, be sure to get a \"Metro-to-Muni transfer\" which costs an extra $0.50, lasts for two hours, and is good on many non-Metro bus systems. These transfers can be bought at TAP vending machines or with exact change from a bus driver.\n\n\n=== By car ===\n\nLos Angeles is notorious for its traffic conditions, and its freeway system can get extremely clogged at any time. Still, automobile travel is an easy way to see many parts of the region, and the only way to reach many of the natural areas surrounding the metropolitan area.\n\n\n==== Navigation ====\nIf you are going to drive, make sure you have access to a smartphone. Google Maps, Waze, and Apple Maps track traffic for the area and work to reroute you from traffic and provide an accurate ETA that includes traffic delays. You can plan your route in advance, schedule your departure to get an accurate ETA, and access transit information with these apps and a cellular data connection.\nEach freeway is identified by a number, and usually one or two names. When giving directions, most locals refer to a freeway by its number and the definite article, e.g. \"the 405 freeway\" or just \"the 405.\" It's recommended that you familiarize yourself with your chosen route before setting out on your trip and pay close attention to traffic and road signs. One particularly annoying aspect of L.A. freeways is finding an onramp; onramps are marked with small green signs marked \"Freeway Entrance\" but these can be frustratingly difficult to find.\nAlthough L.A.'s traffic jams are legendary, the freeway grid provides for an effective movement of traffic and a variety of alternatives. Be sure to have an alternative route planned out in advance; many freeways run parallel to one another and serve as viable alternatives, especially in long-distance trips. You can check sites like Go511 orSigAlert for current traffic information before your trip.\n\n\n==== Dealing with traffic ====\nOn average, residents of Los Angeles County spend an estimated four days a year stuck in traffic. Despite the impressive gains of Metro, dealing with traffic is an inescapable part of many Angelinos lives, especially in suburban areas, and something many visitors may not be able to avoid.\nListening to a radio station is helpful for any long trip through L.A. since most stations regularly disseminate traffic information during the daylight hours. KNX 1070 AM and 97.1 FM, Los Angeles' 24-hour news station, has traffic reports \"on the fives\" (:05, :15, :25, :35, :45, and :55 of each hour) when they aren't running the simulcast of 60 Minutes (7PM on Sunday) or \"Weekly Roundup\". KFI 640 AM and KABC 790 AM run traffic reports four times an hour, usually during commercial breaks of their talk shows. The radio station web sites often have links to graphics showing traffic speeds and the accident logs of the highway patrol. Traffic reports will often use the verbal name for a freeway (e.g., \"westbound Santa Monica Freeway\") instead of the number of the freeway.\nDespite the infamy of Los Angeles' traffic, the only real issues are the sheer length of the rush hour and the volume of traffic. The assertions of driving difficulty and danger will most likely seem unfounded to residents of other large cities, especially comparatively frantic East Coast cities, who often see Los Angeles traffic as relatively easy-going. When traveling on a Los Angeles freeway, remember that slower traffic keeps to the right. Many Angelenos do well over 20 mph of the posted speed limit and cutting them off or remaining in the fast lane at a slow pace will frustrate native drivers.\nIt's actually very easy to drive around Los Angeles in the late night/early morning hours (from around 11PM to 5AM), when driving times can easily be less than a third of what they are during peak hours. However, late hours are when partiers are most likely to be returning from clubs, so be vigilant for drunk drivers. In addition, a lot of construction is scheduled during these off-peak times, so be ready to plan alternative routes. Anyone planning on visiting by car may wish to seriously consider scheduling the trip so as to arrive or depart in the early morning, as this can prevent a great deal of frustration. This is also an excellent time of day to find your way around, memorize your routes, and explore.\n\n\n==== Driving on surface streets ====\nMost cities in Greater Los Angeles have well-maintained streets, but streets within the city of Los Angeles itself tend to have a lot of cracks and potholes. Wilshire Boulevard is particularly notorious for extremely bumpy conditions.\nUnlike most other American cities, most major Los Angeles intersections do not have dedicated left-turn traffic lights, allowing for so-called \"protected\" left turns. Instead, they operate under the rule where you must yield to opposing traffic and turn only when it is safe to do so. But some Los Angeles streets are so congested that it is impossible to turn until the traffic light reaches the yellow (caution) phase. Therefore, it is customary in Los Angeles for as many as two or three vehicles to creep into the middle of such intersections in order to turn against opposing traffic on a yellow light. If you are a first-time visitor, you may find yourself being honked at by other drivers until you become accustomed to this.\nDriving around Downtown L.A. can be frustrating. Even when few vehicles are present, drivers still tend to go slower in this area because of the numerous turns and exits. Additionally, parking in Downtown is very expensive. Many hotels in Downtown and other high-density areas (such as LAX, Hollywood, and Century City) have parking garages but will charge you exorbitant daily parking fees. Even worse, they may have only valet parking, meaning you will also be expected to tip the valet. If you plan to drive around Los Angeles, consider looking for hotels that have free parking or at least reasonable fees for self-parking garages. If you are heading to a high-density area for a short trip, you may want to park at a Metro station and ride the train the rest of the way.\nMany Los Angeles intersections have red light enforcement cameras, linked to sensor loops which are energized about a third of a second after the traffic light turns red. You will know the camera activated when it flashes its strobe light at you to obtain a clear view of your face (which is required along with a picture of the license plate to issue a ticket under California law). These intersections are sometimes marked in advance by signs and should be approached carefully to avoid a fine.\n\n\n==== Freeways ====\n\nIn a general way, freeway names usually identify where the freeway goes from Central Los Angeles. This can be confusing to out-of-towners, as names may change when there is a better-known and closer target; for example, the portion of the 110 north of Downtown is the Pasadena Freeway, while the portion south of Downtown is the Harbor Freeway. Also a numbered freeway can change names; for example, the 101 jumps from the Hollywood Freeway to the Ventura Freeway as it passes through Studio City.\nMany freeways have carpool lanes, which may be entered if you have two or more occupants in a vehicle, or if you're riding a motorcycle. Only enter carpool lanes at designated areas; don't cross double yellow lines into the carpool lane. Portions of the 10 and 110 freeways have toll lanes called Metro ExpressLanes which require a FastTrak transponder in your car to enter (motorcycles require these as well); see the website for details.\nHere are some of the more notable freeways in Los Angeles:\n\n 1 - Pacific Coast Highway (or more commonly PCH): Not actually a freeway, but worth noting as it's convenient for the beach towns since it sticks close to the coast through the county and is a scenic way to tour the L.A. coastline. However, it's usually slower than the 405, as it is riddled with traffic signals. Begins in south Orange County, and runs near on along the beaches in Los Angeles County, and then passes through Malibu.\n 2 - Glendale Freeway: Begins near Echo Park and Dodger Stadium (a few miles NW of downtown) via Glendale Blvd. and goes north to the City of Glendale before merging into the Foothill Freeway.\n 5 - Golden State/Santa Ana Freeway: The main north/south freeway through central L.A., passing through Downtown L.A. and along the east end of the San Fernando Valley. Although this is one of the busiest and most direct freeways in the region, it is also one of the oldest, and is occasionally only three lanes in either direction, though it is being upgraded to four (watch for construction). Known as the Santa Ana Freeway south of downtown, and as the Golden State Freeway north of downtown, but the all the northbound signs read \"I-5 North - Sacramento.\"\n 10 - Santa Monica/San Bernardino Freeway: The main east/west freeway through central L.A., passing by Downtown L.A. This is the main route between central L.A. and Santa Monica, and is a primary route between central L.A. and the Inland Empire to the east.\n 60 - Pomona/Moreno Valley Freeway: Runs east from Downtown L.A. a few miles south of I-10 to the Inland Empire and Moreno Valley. Merges with the I-10 in the mountains west of Palm Springs.\n 91 - Gardena/Artesia/Riverside Freeway: Begins in south Los Angeles, and runs east to Riverside via Orange County. An oddity of this freeway is that it starts at exit #6, since the far western section to the Pacific Coast Highway was never built. However, Artesia Blvd. continues westbound to the PCH after the freeway ends. Known as the Gardena Freeway west of the I-710, as the Artesia Freeway between the I-710 to I-5, and as the Riverside Freeway east of I-5.\n 101 - Hollywood/Ventura Freeway: Runs northwest from Downtown L.A. past Hollywood, and into the San Fernando Valley, where it turns abruptly west and becomes the Ventura Freeway, continuing to the Central Coast, so don't be confused by the fact that signs will indicate 101 North/South or 101 East/West depending on the stretch of freeway. The Hollywood Freeway continues for a few more miles north as  State Route 170 before merging with I-5.\n 105 - Century Freeway or Glenn Anderson Freeway: An east/west route that crosses across south L.A. and serves as a fairly direct link to the LAX airport, which sits at the western end of the 105. At its eastern end, you can only use the Studebaker Rd. entrance/exit if there are two or more people in your vehicle. Otherwise, use the Imperial Hwy or merge to/from the I-605 freeway. The 105 doesn't quite connect with the I-5 Santa Ana freeway. You have to go about a mile and a half (2.4 km) on Imperial Hwy. Use exit #122 when transferring from the I-5 in either direction. Eastbound on the I-105, you cannot easily access Imperial Hwy (unless carpooling to Studebaker Rd.), but the 605 north connects with I-5 in both directions at exit #11 in a couple miles.\n 134 - Ventura Freeway (eastern section) Connects the Foothill Freeway with the Hollywood/Ventura Freeway while running East/West through Pasadena, Glendale, and the San Fernando Valley. Continues into Ventura as the 101 (above), without having to exit.\n  110 - Pasadena/Harbor Freeway: Runs between Pasadena (next to L.A.) in the north and the harbor area in the south, past Downtown L.A. The 110 is unusual in that the southern part of the 110 (the Harbor Freeway) is an interstate while the northern part (the Pasadena Freeway) is a state highway, given that the Pasadena Freeway is an older freeway that can't pass code as an interstate. This portion, also known as the \"Arroyo Seco Parkway,\" was designed in the 1930s and was one of the nation's first limited access roadways. However, it was also designed when it was assumed that cars would be travelling at 35 mph (60 km/h) at most, so the Pasadena Freeway is noted for its extremely short off-ramps, while its on-ramps give you just a few car lengths to accelerate from a complete stop before merging with oncoming traffic.\n 210 - Foothill Freeway: In Pasadena, this freeway turns at a right angle and goes northwest into the San Fernando Valley, much of which is still part of the City of Los Angeles. In the other direction, the freeway goes east to San Bernardino, running parallel with the I-10, but a few miles north of it.\n 405 - San Diego Freeway: The main north/south freeway through West L.A., passing close to LAX airport. North of West L.A., the 405 cuts through the Santa Monica Mountains into the San Fernando Valley. South of LAX, it turns east towards Long Beach and Orange County. The 405 is infamous for its congestion and should be avoided during rush hour. One of the few freeways that doesn't actually reach its namesake city; while Southbound on it you're generally headed toward San Diego, it merges back into I-5 many miles North of San Diego County.\n 605 - San Gabriel Freeway: This north/south freeway doesn't actually enter the city itself, but runs along the eastern edge of Los Angeles County. May be useful when other north/south freeways are congested, or to avoid the busiest freeways when traveling from Disneyland to Magic Mountain, for example.\n 710 - Long Beach Freeway: A north/south artery from East L.A. to Long Beach. This freeway is almost always full of trucks heading in and out of the harbor, so take care when driving near them. Going northbound, the freeway ends abruptly just beyond I-10 at the far eastern edge of the City of Los Angeles and south of Pasadena. The connection to the Pasadena and Foothill Freeways was never built.\n\n\n=== By taxi ===\nTaxis can be expensive. Save for a very small number of locations, you cannot flag one down on the street, but have to call one of the taxi companies to send a cab to pick you up. Depending on where you are, you may have to wait awhile for a taxi to get to you, given that this city experiences a lot of traffic and is very spread out. As such, cabs are expensive and the overwhelming majority of citizens rely on their own vehicles. There are taxi stands at most major hotels, shopping centers and transit stations.\nRideshare services Uber, Lyft and Opoli operate throughout the city, including at LAX, and offer a cheaper alternative to a taxi. Los Angeles is also one of a handful of cities served by Waymo, although its service area is largely limited to the western half of the city between the 101 and 10 Freeways, with no service beyond that area (including to LAX).\nIn the main tourist areas downtown, there are also human-powered bike taxis that convey one or two passengers. For those not too keen on walking this may be a convenient way of seeing the sights.\n\n\n=== By motorcycle ===\nAn often overlooked alternative which deals well with Los Angeles' lackluster public transportation and frustrating traffic conditions is to travel by motorcycle. Rentals range from around $70 for a basic bike up to $300 a day for high-performance sport bikes, with plenty of range and options between. This option garners a higher per-day rental price than a car, with obviously diminished cargo space. However, a motorcycle's significant increase in fuel economy combined with the city's high gas prices, and ease of parking in a notoriously difficult-to-park-in city may be appealing to the adventurous rider. A quick web search will reveal numerous rental agencies. California riders must have a class M1 license. A DOT helmet is required in California.\nOf course, riding a motorcycle should be done by those who are experienced as it is not for the faint of heart. But it may afford the rider a small advantage in terms of travel time. In most states in America, it is illegal to \"split lanes\" \u2014 riding between two adjacent lanes through slow or stopped traffic to get ahead of other vehicles \u2014 as a motorcycle rider is still required to follow all rules and guidelines as if it were a car. Although lane splitting is illegal in most states, it is allowed in California if done responsibly, only when traffic flow is below 30 mph (48 km/h) and your motorcycle is going less than 10 mph (16 km/h) faster than other traffic. Inexperienced riders and those new to California should not attempt to lane split. Mopeds, motor driven cycles (under 149 cc) and motorized bicycles are not allowed on freeways. Foreign travelers not familiar with the United States may notice motorcycles tend to be comparatively large, heavy, and fast and extreme caution should be exercised.\nThe canyon roads of Malibu, Topanga, and the San Gabriel mountains are frequented by motorsports enthusiasts year-round due to their extreme \"twistiness\" and contain celebrated hangouts such as Neptune's Net (on the Pacific Coast Highway), the Rock Store (on Mulholland in Malibu Canyon), and others. Bikers visiting on the weekend will find good company, cold beer, and excellent riding there.\n\n\n=== By bike ===\n\nMetro introduced a bike share program in 2016. Thus far it only covers Downtown Los Angeles, Venice Beach, Hollywood, Koreatown, Culver City, North Hollywood, and Westwood, but there are plans to expand into other communities in the near future. The map shows stations as well as the number of available bikes/free spaces to dock a bike in real time. There are daily ($5 for unlimited 30 minute rides), monthly ($17, free first half hour, $1.75 for every half hour after that) and yearly ($150, free first half hour, $1.75 for every half hour after thar) passes. Metro TAP cards can be registered with the system and used for payment. A separate bike share system is also available in Long Beach.\nThere are also several scooter sharing systems present, such as Bird, Veo, Lime, and Lyft.\n\n\n== See ==\n\nIndividual listings can be found in Los Angeles's district articles\n\n\n=== Show business ===\nEntertainment is what has earned L.A. its fame, so it's no surprise that many come for the sights of Hollywood, where you will find such landmarks to film as Grauman's Chinese Theater and the Hollywood Walk of Fame or gaze up at the Hollywood Sign perched on the hill.\nHowever, while the entertainment industry is still headquartered in Hollywood, most of the major studios have moved elsewhere, particularly San Fernando Valley; Universal City is home to Universal Studios and its associated theme park, CBS has set up shop in Studio City, while nearby Burbank is home to the Warner Brothers Studios and the Walt Disney Studios, among others. On the Westside, Sony Pictures occupies the historic MGM Studios in Culver City, the headquarters of 20th Century Fox sit in Century City, and many television shows are still taped in CBS Television City in Fairfax. Paramount Pictures is the last movie studio left in Hollywood, with its famed double-arched gate facing Melrose Avenue. Many studios offer tours, and at some you might even be lucky enough to attend a television show taping; check the individual pages for details.\nBesides the studios, there are many sights that attract movie buffs and are worth checking out for those interested in the history of film. Hollywood has plenty of museums and classic cinemas related to the Golden Age of Hollywood, while Hollywood, Downtown, Northwest L.A., Wilshire, and Beverly Hills are chock-full of iconic filming locations in a city that's full of them. There are also a few cemeteries noted for being the final resting places of many celebrities and influential writers and directors, particularly the Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Hollywood, the Westwood Village Memorial Park in Westwood, and the massive Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, where you're guaranteed to run into the famous of yesteryear.\nOf course, many also come in the hopes of seeing living celebrities. While your chances of running into one in Hollywood are rather low, you may get lucky in the glamorous neighborhoods of Beverly Hills, West Hollywood, and Malibu, which are home to many celebrity mansions and whose fancy restaurants are sometimes frequented by movie stars. Awards season brings a lot of celebrity-spotting as well, with most of the famous awards shows hosted in Los Angeles: the Academy Awards take place in Hollywood, typically in late February; the Grammy Awards have settled into the Staples Center in Downtown each February; the Golden Globes take place in Beverly Hills each January; and the late summer Primetime Emmys have spent the last several years at the Microsoft Theater in Downtown.\n\n\n=== Historical ===\n\nLos Angeles, as a general rule, hasn't been too careful about retaining its historical artifacts, and that's ignoring the fact that much of the city was only built in the last half-century or so. However, there are some historical attractions for those interested in learning about L.A.'s past:\nEl Pueblo de Los Angeles Historical Monument in Downtown is the site of the original Spanish settlement where Los Angeles was founded in the 1780s. Today it's preserved as a historic district with some of the city's oldest buildings as well as a number of Mexican restaurants and shops along touristy Olvera Street. Two other important sites from Los Angeles' Spanish era are located along the El Camino Real in Los Angeles County: the Mission San Gabriel, which predates the Pueblo de Los Angeles, and the Mission San Fernando in the northern portion of the San Fernando Valley.\nDowntown's Historic Core still has many splendid examples of late 19th and early 20th century architecture, including many old movie palaces and the noteworthy Victorian-style Bradbury Building along Broadway. Just north of the Historic Core is the grand 1920s City Hall building, while just a little further on, across from the El Pueblo area, is the 1930s Mission Revival-style Union Station, the main railway hub for the city. East L.A. has the Heritage Square living history museum, showcasing life in L.A. around the turn of the 20th century.\nHeading west from Downtown, the Miracle Mile district along Wilshire has a lot of mid-20th century commercial architecture, including some superb examples of Art Deco and Streamline architecture. Another great Art Deco structure is the Griffith Observatory atop Griffith Park, famed for its many appearances in film and its sweeping view of the city. And of course, Hollywood, Beverly Hills, and Culver City have numerous theaters, studios, and other examples of architecture dating from the Golden Age of Hollywood.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nOf Los Angeles' museums, the Getty Center in West L.A. is the most renowned, regularly hailed as one of the finest art museums in the country. Located above the city on the Santa Monica mountains, it has a spectacular view of the L.A. basin and the Pacific Ocean, with an extensive European art collection inside. The old museum, the Getty Villa in Pacific Palisades, is also worth a visit for its collection of artifacts from ancient Greece and Rome. Admission to both is free (although the Villa requires tickets to be reserved in advance) and you can visit both in the same day (Wednesday through Sunday only) and pay the parking fee only once, but don't expect to have any time left over for other activities.\nAnother splendid institution is the Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA), which has its main building on Grand Avenue in Downtown with branches in Little Tokyo and West Hollywood. Across the street from the MOCA is The Broad, a contemporary art museum housed in a striking building. The massive campus of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art on Wilshire features a particularly varied collection of works from around the world, with strong collections of Asian, Latin American, and American art, as well as a new contemporary art museum on its campus.\nExposition Park holds two of LA's best science museums, the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County and the California Science Center, both of which have an extensive range of exhibits. The Natural History Museum is the largest of its kind on the West Coast, while the Science Center is reputed for its aircraft collection, which includes the Space Shuttle Endeavour. Another excellent museum is the Page Museum at the La Brea Tar Pits in Wilshire, which preserves the famous tar pits and showcases numerous fossils that have been excavated from the tar. Long Beach has the spectacular Aquarium of the Pacific, one of the largest aquariums in the country, right across the harbor from the historic Queen Mary ocean liner. On the other side of the port from Long Beach is San Pedro, which holds several maritime museums.\nLos Angeles also has many excellent historical and cultural museums. The Autry Museum in Griffith Park has numerous exhibits on the history of the American West, with plenty of cowboy artifacts and memorabilia from Hollywood westerns. Exposition Park is home to the California African-American Museum while Little Tokyo holds the Japanese American National Museum. In West L.A. you'll find the Museum of Tolerance, which has a strong focus on the history of the Holocaust, and the Skirball Cultural Center in the hills near the Getty Center, with exhibits devoted to Jewish history and culture. Culver City has the Wende Museum, with a collection of Cold War artifacts from Soviet-era Eastern Europe. Culver City is also home to the quirky Museum of Jurassic Technology, an artistic blending of fact and fiction that tends to defy proper explanation but still delights visitors.\n\n\n=== Parks and scenery ===\n\nGriffith Park in Northwest LA is an absolutely massive park (indeed, it is five times larger than New York's Central Park) that sprawls across the hills near the Hollywood Sign and is a great place for hikes or picnics, with excellent views of the city. Amidst the rugged terrain of the park are numerous hiking trails and tucked-away sights, as well as major draws like the Los Angeles Zoo, the Autry Museum of the American West, the iconic and historic Griffith Observatory, the Equidome, and plenty of recreational activities. Also in Northwest LA are Echo Park and MacArthur Park, both of which are popular neighborhood parks with picturesque lakes and excellent views of the downtown skyline, and Barnsdall Art Park, which sits atop a hill overlooking East Hollywood and holds a community art complex centered around a Frank Lloyd Wright-designed house. Exposition Park in South Central LA is a pleasant green space, with a beautiful rose garden and several cultural institutions including the Natural History Museum, the California Science Center, and several venues from the 1984 Olympics including the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Pan Pacific Park in Wilshire is another popular neighborhood park.\nAbove Hollywood and West LA is winding Mulholland Drive, a famous road that hugs the ridgeline of the Hollywood Hills and has been the setting for countless movies and first kisses, with spectacular views over the city and the Hollywood Sign, not to mention all the celebrity mansions that line the road. Another excellent hilltop view can be found at the Baldwin Hills Scenic Overlook above Culver City in the middle of the Westside, which offers marvelous views over the basin and the Pacific Ocean.\nIf coastal scenery is what you seek, Malibu is a must-see for its fantastic ocean views and mansions perched atop the ocean cliffs, hugging the coastline beneath the Santa Monica Mountains, which itself makes for a pleasant retreat from the city with its miles of scenic roadways and hiking trails. Further south, Palos Verdes is an oasis of ocean cliffs, Eucalyptus trees, and walking trails at the very southwestern corner of the basin, with a historic lighthouse with views of distant Santa Catalina Island, a popular destination for tourists and locals seeking to escape the city.\nFurther afield, the San Fernando and San Gabriel Valleys hold a few lovely botanical gardens open to visitors, most notably the large and extensive Los Angeles County Arboretum in Arcadia, the private Descanso Gardens in La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge, the Japanese Garden in Van Nuys, and the botanical gardens of the stately Huntington Library in San Marino. Above the valley, the Angeles National Forest covers the steep and rugged San Gabriel Mountains, with its many scenic roads and recreational opportunities.\nThe palm tree is the iconic and legendary symbol of Los Angeles. Many of its trees can be seen in many urban areas of the city, including Exposition Park, which includes L.A.'s oldest palm tree.\n\n\n== Do ==\nThe Pacific Ocean! Visitors will have to charter a boat to see this most magnificent thing to see in Los Angeles. OnBoat charter boats in Los Angeles has numerous choices. See https://onboat.co/los-angeles-yacht-charter/\nIndividual listings can be found in Los Angeles's district articles\n\n\n=== Beaches ===\nThe Westside is home to the most famous beaches of LA: Venice Beach, with its colorful Boardwalk and Muscle Beach, and the adjacent town of Santa Monica, with its popular pier and amusement park. Both communities share an expansive stretch of sandy beach which gets very crowded in the summer and which have plenty of amusements and facilities available, as well as a very festive scene in Venice that's fantastic for people watching. Just south of Venice is the less-crowded Dockweiler State Beach in the aptly-named town of Playa del Rey (Spanish for beach of the king). Further north, where the coastline meets the Santa Monica Mountains, are scenic beaches in Pacific Palisades and Malibu; Pacific Palisades' Will Rogers State Beach is expansive and quite popular, while Malibu's narrower Surfrider Beach is famed for its surf breaks.\nSouth Bay is home to a number of beaches that are also very popular, in particular the Beach Cities of Manhattan Beach, Hermosa Beach, and Redondo Beach, with piers and expansive stretches of sand lined with expensive houses. Hermosa is famed for its festive atmosphere, regularly holding volleyball tournaments and surfing competitions, and all three are popular with families and beach-goers. Also good but less crowded is Torrance Beach further south, which is noted for great surfing, and the very scenic stretch of coastline in Palos Verdes, which holds many rocky coves and tidepools that make for fun exploration.\nOff the coast and enormously popular for people taking a day trip out of L.A. are the picturesque beaches of Catalina Island. Additionally, the Beach Cities of nearby Orange County are very popular with locals. For those who are more into boats than sand, Marina del Rey is located just south of Venice and is the world's largest man-made small-craft harbor, offering plenty of mooring as well as motorized and non-motorized rentals.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nLos Angeles has great opportunities for seeing live pro sports. The Major League Baseball Los Angeles Dodgers are one of the most famous teams in baseball and a game at Dodger Stadium in Elysian Park, in the hills north of downtown, is an absolute treat for baseball fans. However, LA's most successful sports franchise has been and remains the Los Angeles Lakers of the NBA, undoubtedly one of the greatest basketball teams in history. They play at Crypto.com Arena in Downtown, which they shared with another NBA team, the much less successful Los Angeles Clippers, before the Clippers moved to the new Intuit Dome in Inglewood in 2024. Also playing at Crypto.com Arena are the Los Angeles Kings of the National Hockey League and the Los Angeles Sparks of the WNBA. The city has two Major League Soccer teams\u2014the LA Galaxy, which plays at Dignity Health Sports Park in Carson, and Los Angeles FC, which started play in 2018 at BMO Stadium in Exposition Park. Angel City FC started play in the National Women's Soccer League in 2022, playing in LAFC's stadium.\nThe National Football League now has two teams in the L.A. area, both having returned to the area after having spent decades elsewhere. The Los Angeles Rams, which called L.A. home from 1946 to 1994 before moving to St. Louis, returned to L.A. in 2016. The Los Angeles Chargers, which started their life in the old American Football League in 1960, moved to San Diego the next year and didn't return until 2017. Both teams share SoFi Stadium in Inglewood. For the second-largest city in the country, Los Angeles long showed an inexplicable inability to hold down a NFL franchise; during the Rams' stint in St. Louis, Los Angeles football fans made do with the local college teams: the USC Trojans football team plays in the Coliseum, while the UCLA Bruins play in the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, which also hosts the annual famous college bowl game the stadium is named after.\nIn addition, Major League Baseball's Los Angeles Angels and the National Hockey League's Anaheim Ducks play in nearby Anaheim in Orange County.\nMajor college sports in L.A. aren't limited to USC and UCLA, although those schools have by far the highest profiles since they're the only two NCAA Division I schools in the area that play football. The immediate L.A. area boasts seven other Division I programs. The city of Los Angeles boasts the Cal State Northridge Matadors (or CSUN Matadors) in the San Fernando Valley district of Northridge and the Loyola Marymount Lions in Westchester, while Los Angeles County also boasts the Pepperdine Waves just outside the Malibu city limits and the Long Beach State teams, known as The Beach. Orange County is home to the Cal State Fullerton Titans and UC Irvine Anteaters, while the Inland Empire city of Riverside is home to the UC Riverside Highlanders and the California Baptist Lancers.\nThe USA Sevens, the country's annual event in the SVNS, the current incarnation of World Rugby's series for men's and women's national teams in rugby sevens, returned to Dignity Health Sports Park in the 2023\u201324 season. Rugby sevens is a variant of rugby union played on a full-sized field, but with seven players per side instead of 15, and halves of 7 minutes instead of 40. The short duration of each game allows a complete tournament to be held over a single weekend. Both the men's and women's tournaments feature 12 teams, and the event strongly encourages a festival atmosphere.\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nNo matter what music you're into, Los Angeles will feature artists to your taste, be it rock venues on Sunset Blvd, jazz clubs in Hollywood, or classical music in Downtown, just to scratch the surface. From the ambiance of the famous Hollywood Bowl to the spectacle of seeing a concert with 90,000 of your closest friends in the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, L.A. has many venues that are worth exploring.\nDowntown Los Angeles holds several major entertainment venues. The 7,100-seat Microsoft Theater has become L.A.'s premiere venue for rock concerts and awards shows, while the nearby Staples Center, though primarily a sports venue, also hosts a large number of big-name concerts with its 19,000-seat capacity. Near the Civic Center, the Los Angeles Music Center consists of four music halls, most notably the Gehry-designed Walt Disney Concert Hall, home of the Los Angeles Philharmonic and Los Angeles Master Chorale, and the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, home to the Los Angeles Opera.\nGriffith Park holds the Greek Theatre, an outdoor amphitheater modeled after a Greek temple that hosts many concerts. Nearby Hollywood has two major concert venues in the Hollywood Palladium and the Fonda Theatre, the latter of which is reputed for its indie band scene and both of which regularly host big-name acts. A little further south, Wilshire has a couple of classic rock concert venues at the El Rey Theatre and The Wiltern. West Hollywood is home to some legendary rock nightclubs along the Sunset Strip, like Troubadour, Whisky a Go Go, and The Viper Room. Next to the USC campus and near Exposition Park in South Central L.A. is the Shrine Auditorium, a large enclosed amphitheater that holds over 6,000 people and regularly hosts large concerts and stage shows. In Inglewood, The Forum regularly hosts concerts as well as the occasional sports event.\nLos Angeles also has an abundance of records stores scattered around the city, and though vinyl has disappeared from the shelves of most regular record stores, there are still plenty of stores that sell new and used vinyl. Amoeba Music in Hollywood is without a doubt the best in the city. An exploration of underground music could begin at The Smell in Downtown or listen to KXLU 88.9 FM Monday-Friday for details on numerous shows.\n\n\n=== Theater ===\n\nLos Angeles is a major center for stand-up and improvisational comedy, rivaling New York City given its proximity to the Hollywood industry and innovative scene; L.A. has become the undisputed center for comedy podcasts. There are many excellent comedy venues in town, but a few consistently rise to the top. The Comedy Store is a legendary venue in West Hollywood on the Sunset Strip that gave rise to many of the biggest names in the 1970s and still hosts the occasional nationally recognized comic. Also on the Sunset Strip is the Laugh Factory, which consistently features plenty of big-name comics. Elsewhere in West Hollywood you'll find the Largo at the Coronet, a very popular venue that emphasizes the intersection between comedy and live music and regularly hosts podcast shows. Another renowned spot is the Upright Citizens Brigade in Hollywood, which has cultivated some of the best comics in the industry today and dominates L.A.'s improv and experimental comedy scene. Another pair of great improv venues are the Improv and The Groundlings, two popular clubs on Melrose Avenue in Fairfax.\nVenues for stage productions abound in L.A., with the largest concentration being in Downtown. Along Broadway within Downtown's Historic Core, the Theater District is full of old movie palaces that have been converted to performance spaces and concert halls. In Civic Center, the Ahmanson Theatre of the Los Angeles Music Center is the city's main venue for plays, while the Music Center's Mark Taper Forum is a prominent venue for experimental theater. The historic Pantages Theatre in Hollywood is the place to see Broadway musicals in town. Near the Hollywood Bowl is the Ford Theatre, a historic outdoor amphitheater that puts on community theater productions. Out in Westwood, the UCLA-affiliated Geffen Playhouse is noted for their original productions.\n\n\n=== Events ===\n\nBefitting its size, Los Angeles plays host to many major events throughout the year, from large conventions and spectacular holiday celebrations to more low-key neighborhood festivals. Whenever you come, you can be assured that something will be happening. What follows is just a sampling of the biggest annual events that take place in L.A.\nEvery January 1st, the New Year is rung in with the Tournament of Roses Parade, a massively popular parade in Pasadena with dozens of marching bands and elaborate floats before the famed Rose Bowl football game. Chinese New Year celebrations are held throughout the city in early February, with the biggest taking place in Chinatown with a dragon parade, live music, food, and firecrackers. March brings the L.A. Marathon, a massive event in which thousands of runners make their way from Dodger Stadium to Santa Monica. The popular Fiesta Broadway event takes place in Downtown on the last Sunday of April and is billed as the largest Cinco de Mayo celebration in the world, with lots of Mexican food, music, and pinatas.\nMemorial Day weekend marks the start of summer, and is marked by a tribute at the Battleship USS Iowa in San Pedro. Summer brings many of the city's biggest cultural festivals, such as Film Independent's Los Angeles Film Festival in June, West Hollywood's massive celebration of LGBT culture during Pride Week, and Little Tokyo's Nisei Week Japanese Festival in mid-August. Summer also sees many major conventions and expositions, including the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in June and Anime Expo in July, both of which are held at the Los Angeles Convention Center in Downtown. The Fourth of July is celebrated with lots of events across the city, most notably a spectacular fireworks show set to live music at the Hollywood Bowl.\nIn the fall, the Los Angeles County Fair takes place every September with concerts, carnival rides and agricultural exhibits in Pomona out in the San Gabriel Valley. Halloween brings lots of horror-themed events across the city, most notably the wildly popular West Hollywood Halloween Carnaval. After Thanksgiving, the holiday season kicks off with the Hollywood Christmas Parade, with plenty of elaborate floats, classic cars, and celebrity appearances. Other popular events during the holiday season include the Marina del Rey Holiday Boat Parade and a popular Christmas Eve music show in Downtown at the L.A. County Holiday Celebration.\n\n\n== Learn ==\nLos Angeles, like most major U.S. cities, has its fair share of colleges and universities. Of these, the largest are the University of California, Los Angeles; the University of Southern California; California State University, Los Angeles; and California State University, Northridge. Within the wider L.A. region are some of the most prestigious institutions of higher education in the U.S., including the Claremont Colleges \u2014 home to Pomona College, the premier liberal arts college on the West Coast, and several other highly selective schools \u2014 and the prestigious California Institute of Technology, the West Coast rival to MIT.\n\n\n== Buy ==\n\nIndividual listings can be found in Los Angeles's district articles\nLos Angeles has a well-known diversity of unique shopping destinations. Shopping malls will dominate your shopping experience in L.A. and even non-shopping visitors are likely to encounter them; for example, the Hollywood and Highland mall is a popular meeting point in Hollywood for those gazing at the Walk of Fame and Mann's Chinese Theater, The Grove is a major destination in Fairfax next to the historic Farmer's Market, and West Hollywood's Beverly Center is a massive eight-story shopping complex with a nice view of the city from its food court patio.\nLacking any significant public square, Los Angeles funnels its civic life onto its streets. Among the most popular shopping streets is Larchmont Blvd, which caters to the wealthy elite of Hancock Park with one-of-a-kind boutiques. Melrose Avenue in West Hollywood one-ups Larchmont Blvd with celebrity presence. And then there's the fabled Rodeo Drive of Beverly Hills (uses the Spanish pronunciation: Roh-DAY-oh), famed for its high-end fashion stores.\nIn Downtown, the chaos of Broadway is a far cry from the comforts of manicured shopping centers, with merchandise geared towards the region's Latino population. Here, beneath the street's opulent early-20th century movie palaces, you can find a lot of brand name merchandise at discounted prices; forty dollars will probably get you a brand new wardrobe. Nearby is the gritty flea market of Santee Alley, chock full of knock-off designer labels and pirated DVD's and CD's. For a similar experience, try Alvarado Blvd between Wilshire and 6th in Westlake, where you can gain an insight into how most of working-class Los Angeles shops. Big deals can be found on a wide range of counterfeit goods, but don't stay too long after dark when the neighborhood gets sketchy. Make sure to check out the Art Deco buildings that exist in between the makeshift warehouses as well as the Alvarado Terrace Park, surrounded by early-20th century mansions.\nDowntown is also a destination for some specialized retail destinations. Want flowers? Why there's a Flower District in Downtown! Jewelry? Fashion? Seafood? Toys? Yep, there are entire districts in Downtown dedicated to these particular products. You can buy art in Gallery Row up and down Main Street or see artists at work in the Arts District. All of these are located south and east of the towering Financial District, existing alongside the notorious Skid Row.\n\n\n=== Groceries and other basics ===\n7-Eleven convenience stores are found every few blocks and are always open 24-7, but have limited selection and high prices. The three major pharmacy chains in Los Angeles are Walgreens, CVS, and Rite Aid. They offer a wider selection of many items compared to convenience stores, but at the same high prices.\nThe major supermarket chains are Ralphs and Food4Less (owned by Kroger) and Pavilions and Vons (both owned by Albertsons). Ralphs and Vons both have a few stores open 24-7. They are useful for picking up supplies like drinks and snacks if your flight arrives late at night.\nThe largest big box retailer, Walmart, has no stores in or near the Los Angeles city limits south of the Santa Monica Mountains (though there are stores in other cities in southern Los Angeles County). Walmart Supercenters can be found in West Hills, Porter Ranch, Panorama City, and Burbank and generally close at 11 p.m.\nTarget, the second largest American big box retailer, has stores in Westwood, West Hollywood, Beverly Grove, Baldwin Hills and Downtown L.A. Some are open till midnight, others close at 11 p.m.\nWhole Foods Market, a national upscale grocery store chain, has stores across Los Angeles. The two local upscale grocery store chains are Gelson's and Bristol Farms. All three chains tend to have higher prices than the large supermarket chains listed above.\n\n\n== Eat ==\n\nIndividual listings can be found in Los Angeles's district articles\nThe Los Angeles area is one of the best places in the country for food - you can find just about anything you can imagine somewhere within its loose borders. From traditional American diner culture (try Mel's Drive-In in West Hollywood) to the new wave of organic cafes, to inexpensive taco trucks, and swanky eateries with breath-taking food, there is no shortage of options.\nLos Angeles abounds with inexpensive, authentic food that represents the culinary traditions of L.A.'s many immigrant communities. You have to be willing to do a little legwork, go to neighborhoods you might not otherwise go to and often deal with charmless fluorescent-lit storefronts in strip malls, but your reward is hype-free, authentic cuisine from around the world served up at bargain prices. The late and dearly missed food critic Jonathan Gold found and reviewed these gems starting in the 1980s, mostly for the free LA Weekly before he moved to the food section of the LA Times, and most of his reviews are still relevant today.\nThe newest arrival on the L.A. food scene is the gourmet food truck. These are not your average taco trucks and construction-site catering operations (although those exist too), but purveyors of creative and surprisingly high-quality food. Food trucks, particularly taco trucks, can be found in most parts of the city. A few noteworthy food trucks are \"Grill Em All,\" run by 2 metalheads doing outstanding gourmet hamburgers, \"Nom Nom,\" doing Vietnamese banh mi sandwiches, and \"Kogi,\" doing Korean-inspired tacos and burritos. Many trucks also have their own websites and post their daily schedules and locations on Twitter.\nOn the opposite spectrum from food trucks, those seeking high-end dining have some of the country's finest restaurants to choose from. While the Michelin guide stopped reviewing Los Angeles in 2010, Beverly Hills had several eateries that were rated by Michelin, including Wolfgang Puck's first restaurant, Spago. While there are numerous destinations for an upscale meal throughout the LA area, Santa Monica is notable as the only city besides Beverly Hills that can lay claim to multiple Michelin starred restaurants.\nCoverage of regional food from other parts of the U.S. is spotty. Migration into the city has been disproportionately from Texas and Oklahoma, the South, Midwest and greater New York City and food representing these areas is easy enough to find. Food representing New England and other parts of the East Coast, the Pacific Northwest, and the Intermountain-Rocky Mountain regions can be elusive, along with many ethnic cuisines with central- and east-European origins. However L.A. is the birthplace of the drive-thru and numerous fast food chains clog the roadsides. The In-N-Out Burger chain is far above average for hamburgers, french fries and milkshakes. Another famous Los Angeles establishment is Original Tommy's, which specializes in chili burgers.\nThe cultural diversity of Los Angeles is an evident influence on the local vegetarian food restaurant industry. You can find strictly vegan and vegetarian dining, be it American, Mexican, Chinese, Ethiopian, and Thai among others. Other dietary restrictions are catered to as well. For example Genghis Cohen in West Hollywood serves Jewish Chinese food and kosher Mexican or Italian is not hard to find along predominantly Jewish parts of Pico Boulevard.\nThere are several different supermarket chains of varying quality. Trader Joe's, now a nationwide chain, started out in Pasadena. They normally give out great samples to the public and sell their acclaimed Charles Shaw wine, also known as \"Two Buck Chuck.\" At the luxurious end, Erewhon is a local grocery chain that has become notorious even outside the area for its high prices.\nLA visitors and locals alike have the opportunity to indulge in a selection of specially priced three-course menus from a wide variety of LA's best restaurants during dineLA Restaurant Week.\n\n\n== Drink ==\nIndividual listings can be found in Los Angeles's district articles\nHotel bars are generally considered by Angelenos to be the nicest places to have drinks. Some of the more popular upscale ones include Chateau Marmont, Skybar at The Mondrian, and  Tower Bar at the Sunset Tower on the Sunset Strip in West Hollywood, and The Rooftop Bar at The Standard in Downtown LA. Hollywood and the Sunset Strip are generally considered the nightlife centers of LA, though neighborhoods such as Silver Lake, Los Feliz, and Echo Park in Northwest LA are home to the dive bars and cafes favored by trendy hipsters. Downtown has recaptured some of its former glory with a selection of popular nightlife destinations such as The Golden Gopher, The Edison and the bars/clubs at LA Live. Hollywood's Cahuenga Corridor (Cahuenga between Selma and Hollywood Boulevard) boasts several popular bars in a row, making bar-hopping a possibility in a city where it's not the norm.\nBars close at 2AM with most last calls at 1:30 or 1:45AM. It is worth noting that some bars and almost all clubs charge cover and some may have VIP lists that are relatively easy to get on. Look up promoters and ask them to add you to their list. This is the easiest way to get into many of the popular Hollywood clubs.\n\n\n== Sleep ==\nIndividual listings can be found in Los Angeles's district articles\nIt's hard to summarize the plethora of hotel options in L.A. From some of the most opulent (and expensive) hotels in the world to budget hostels to apartment-hotel crash pads, there's something for everyone. Deciding where to stay will have a lot to do with what areas you plan on visiting, and how you're going to get there. As usual in Southern California, a car opens up a world of options, but be sure to check the parking arrangement at your accommodations before you arrive.\nHollywood and the Sunset Strip are probably the most popular options for those wanting to sight-see and chase their image of that world. Downtown has long been popular with the business crowd but is rapidly receiving a makeover with newer hotels drawing a hipper crowd. Beverly Hills has some of the nicest hotels in the city, and one should expect the prices to reflect its reputation. Sun and sand seekers can head to Santa Monica or Venice, while those just in town for a day or two might consider staying in one of the suburbs near LAX. To the northeast of Downtown L.A., Pasadena is a peaceful and leafy city and a good alternative that's still proximate to many major attractions, while Burbank has many places convenient to the Valley. Long Beach offers plenty of cheaper accommodations on the south side of the city.\n\n\n== Connect ==\n\n\n=== Internet ===\nInternet cafes are spread around town and most easily found in heavily touristed spots such as Hollywood Blvd and Melrose Ave.  For most travelers, stopping by a local coffee shop such as Starbucks or The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf should suffice. Most will either have free service for customers or require a nominal fee for usage. Many less expensive hotels and motels also offer complimentary internet access, often usable in the lobby before you check in.\nThere is also a growing trend for local fast food establishments and some restaurants to provide complimentary Wi-Fi.\n\n\n=== By mail ===\nThe below are the main post offices that distribute mail to and receive mail from much of the greater Los Angeles area. There are numerous other (smaller) post office branches in different neighborhoods and at least one (or more) in each adjacent city/municipality serving specific zip code(s) which may be closer to where you are staying in and not listed in the below:\n\n Los Angeles Post Office (US Postal Service), (main post office) 7101 S Central, \u260f +1 323 586-4415.

Nearest post office to Los Angeles International Airport that serves zip codes 90009 and 90245. There are no post office branches or drop boxes in the airport terminals. Domestic and international mail going into and coming out of flights are handled in a separate facility next to the cargo terminals that is no open to the public. (updated May 2020)\n\n\n== Stay safe ==\nFor emergencies in Los Angeles County, dial 911 toll-free from any phone including payphones. Dialing 911 from a cellphone will place you in contact with the California Highway Patrol.\nMost tourist destinations within the Los Angeles area tend to be fairly safe, including Hollywood, Beverly Hills, Santa Monica, Westwood, and West L.A. However, walking at night in some areas of the city (and some suburban cities as well) should be conducted with caution; and depending on the area, in groups. If traveling by car there is little threat of being harassed day or night, provided you avoid driving around neighborhoods with blatant signs of gang activity as mentioned below.\nCertain areas in or near downtown, such as Skid Row (which is where the Greyhound station is located), Pico-Union, Westlake, Boyle Heights, South Central, Compton, Inglewood, Harbor Gateway, and Wilmington can be dangerous regardless of the time of day and should be avoided altogether when walking if possible. If traveling in the San Fernando Valley region of Los Angeles, the neighborhoods of Pacoima, Panorama City, Van Nuys, North Hills, and Canoga Park are also best avoided on foot.\nThough cities such as Detroit, St. Louis, and Atlanta have higher reported crime rates per capita than Los Angeles, these numbers can be deceiving. L.A. statistics are skewed because safe neighborhoods such as Bel Air, Pacific Palisades and Westwood help balance the numbers from the very dangerous neighborhoods. If the South Central area of Los Angeles were counted as its own city, it would have the highest crime and murder rate of any city in America. Neighboring Compton, which is an independent city, ranks as the fourth most dangerous city in America. Luckily for Los Angeles, Compton's statistics are not counted as part of L.A.'s crime data, but the cities border each other. As a general rule, you should exercise great caution if walking in the area roughly bounded by Interstate 10 on the north, Interstate 710 on the east, Artesia Blvd/Highway 91 on the south, and La Cienega Boulevard on the west. East LA also has a higher crime rate than other areas and has gang problems as well.\nLos Angeles (City and County) is considered to be the gang capital of America. Gangs generally confine themselves to certain areas and should be of little concern to the typical traveler, who is unlikely to venture into such areas. Gangs will usually identify their territory with graffiti markings. While most visitors to L.A. will not visit neighborhoods where gang violence is a concern, common-sense precautions apply should you become lost and end up in a bad neighborhood: remain on high-visibility roads or freeways, avoid confrontations with groups of young men, and should a confrontation arise flee immediately. If a person who appears to be a gang member asks you where you are from, prepare to flee or to defend yourself, as that is a common gang challenge. Use common sense on freeways to avoid incidents of road rage, which accounts for ten or so deaths per year.\nMost homeless individuals are harmless; they will likely only ask you for money and if you refuse, will simply go on to the next person.  They are most heavily concentrated in Hollywood, Skid Row, and Venice Beach. Avoid walking along Skid Row near Downtown at any time of day or night.\nSince Covid, the perceived safety of the LA Metro has deteriorated sharply as it has become home to large numbers of homeless people, drug addicts and people with severe mental health issues who have been driven there from other public spaces in LA. This, in turn, has got it stuck in a vicious cycle where the perception of it being unsafe has further decreased ridership, which in turn makes the overall safety of the system even worse. While the vast majority of these people pose little danger to passengers, you are nonetheless very likely to see some extremely unsettling and unpredictable behaviour. Thus, in April 2024, the LA Metro board unanimously voted to declare a public safety emergency, and in June, a USC Dornsife survey found that 84% of Los Angeles residents believe the metro is unsafe. Avoid all travel on the metro in the late evening and stick to busy periods if possible.\nMinor earthquakes happen occasionally but they're almost always harmless. In the unlikely event of a major earthquake: If you're outside, try to find an open space clear of anything that might fall on you, such as trees, power lines, street lights or buildings. If you're inside, try to shield yourself under a table or desk from falling debris; your biggest threat comes from breaking windows and falling objects such as ceiling tiles and bookshelves, so try to reduce your exposure to these threats. If you can't find a table or similar protection, at the very least cover your head and neck with your arms. You are more likely to be injured if you try to run or stand during a quake, so drop to your hands and knees and crawl if you need to move. If you're driving, stop your car and move out of traffic, and stay in your car in a place clear of trees, power lines, street lights, and over- or underpasses. Since the 1950s, buildings have become progressively stronger with stricter building code regulations and research, and most buildings built after 1978 are in no danger of collapsing in the unlikely event of a major earthquake during your visit.\nNature's biggest threat, which the world has been made well aware of in the last decade, is wildfires. Fires can break out at any time, though the biggest danger comes on days when the Santa Ana winds are blowing, as the extreme wind speeds can carry burning embers miles ahead of the main fire front. Don't think you are safe because you in an urban area \u2013 though outbreaks are most likely in the hills, fires have been known to spread into dense urban areas \u2013 the January 2025 fires saw evacuation orders extend all the way into Hollywood, shutting down attractions such as the Walk of Fame and sending nearly 200,000 fleeing for their lives. If the National Weather Service believes the risk of wildfires is elevated, they will issue a Red Flag warning. A Red Flag Warning signifies the highest level of fire danger, requiring heightened awareness and caution from all residents. During these periods, even a small spark can lead to a major wildfire. The power may be shut off in your area as a precaution \u2013 faulty power lines have caused many fires, and shutting off power prevents sparks from igniting one should the lines fail or clash in high winds. You should avoid vulnerable areas on these days if at all possible, and refrain from lighting any kind of fire outdoors. If you are in area that is under an evacuation warning, do not hesitate or wait and see: get out as soon as you can. Evacuation centres will be open: find out where these are. In extreme fire weather, you may have very little time to flee. If you find yourself in a situation where you need to abandon your car and flee on foot, leave your keys in the ignition. This is so firefighters and police can move your car out of their way instead of wasting precious time moving it through other means.\nIn the aftermath of a fire, air quality will be poor (see below). Cases of Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome may also spike due to people being exposed to the bodies of animals killed in the fire \u2013 this risk exists with any dead animal or in animal dens, so do not approach either at any time.\n\n\n== Stay healthy ==\nLos Angeles has a notorious reputation for air pollution problems. However, air quality in the city has improved dramatically, and Los Angeles has even fallen from its Number One position on lists of the worst air in the United States due to aggressive cleanup efforts on behalf of the state and regional air quality authorities. Generally, smog is worst during summer months and is worse further inland where it is away from the ocean breezes and gets trapped by the surrounding mountains. \"Smog Alert\" days are at an all-time low, but air pollution can still become a problem if a wildfire is burning in surrounding hills. For more information, visit the AQMD (Air Quality Management District) website for air quality information in the region.\n\n\n== Cope ==\n\n\n=== Newspapers ===\nLos Angeles' primary newspaper is the Los Angeles Times, and another daily newspaper is the Los Angeles Daily News. The free LA Weekly comes out on Thursdays and is a good source for concerts, movies, and other local information. A few local areas may have their own free neighborhood papers as well.\n\n\n=== Gyms ===\n24 Hour Fitness and LA Fitness/Esporta (which now includes Ballys) have many locations throughout the area and are big here. If you have a regular membership with either of them from back home your membership is good here. Some memberships are only good for one location and will cost extra to use a gym/club other than your home location. Ask before leaving home. Day passes range from $10-20. Bring a lock and towel.\n\n\n=== Consulates ===\nLos Angeles is home to many people of different nationalities and language backgrounds. Therefore, many countries have established full service consulates (Consulates General) in Los Angeles to provide consular services for their nationals living in (southern) California and in the adjacent states in the southwestern part of the U.S. (or the entire west coast) as well as visa services for others seeking to visit their respective countries (if required). The Honorary Consulates are there for commercial, cultural and business purposes and offer limited or no consular services except in emergencies. Most of the consulates are located along Wilshire Blvd between Downtown Los Angeles and Santa Monica, through Beverly Hills, the Wilshire neighborhood and West Los Angeles. They can also be in other parts of town too:\n\n  Afghanistan, 11040 Santa Monica Blvd, \u260f +1 310 473-6583, fax: +1 310 473-6775, info_la@afghanconsulategeneral.org. C.

        "title": "Barcelona",
        "extract": "Barcelona is Spain's second largest city, with a population of nearly two million people, and the capital of Catalonia. A major port on the northeastern Mediterranean coast of Spain, Barcelona has a wide variety of attractions that bring in tourists from around the globe. The many faces of Barcelona include the medieval Old Town, and the unique street grid resulting from 19th-century urban planning. The city has long sandy beaches and green parks on the hills, pretty much side-by-side. It is also famous for a number of prominent buildings, of which the most-known are by the architect Antoni Gaud\u00ed, including his Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, which became Barcelona's symbol to many.\nFounded more than 2,000 years ago as the ancient Roman town Barcino, Barcelona is as historic as it is modern, with a constant flow of projects changing the face of the city and long-standing penchant for design and innovation. Thanks to the wealth of attractions, a very well-developed accommodation base, a lively nightlife and a robust transportation system, Barcelona has become one of Europe's, and pretty much the world's, most popular tourist destinations.\n\n\n== Districts ==\n\n \n \n\n\n== Understand ==\n\n\n=== When to visit ===\n\nAugust is probably the busiest time for tourists in Barcelona.  However, many shops and restaurants are closed from early-August to early September. During this time, you will find the most expensive hotel rates (outside of conference times such as the Mobile World Congress), and the city is devoid of locals, as the vast majority of residents go on vacation in August and leave the heat and humidity to the hordes of arriving tourists. This is also one of the highest periods of home break-ins, as criminals know that many places are unoccupied for an entire month.\nWhile Barcelona has decent, albeit crowded beaches, the locals will be very appreciative if visitors do not consider Barcelona a beach resort and absolutely do not wear beachwear when visiting churches, restaurants, etc. If you only want a beach, and a good beach at that, head south to Costa Daurada, north to Costa Brava or out to sea for the Balearic Islands.\nBarcelona can be visited off-season and despite the cold weather, is a lovely city even in the winter months of January and February, as long as the possibility of rain is low. Given the high humidity, 19\u201323 \u00b0C (66\u201373 \u00b0F) is considered comfortable weather, which is usually the temperature from May to June, and from late August to October. These are the best times to visit the city.  Anything warmer than this can feel too hot, and the period from November to April is quite chilly and at times gloomy.\n\n\n=== With children ===\nToddler happiness is considered a public responsibility in Spain. In any public place, people around you will make every effort possible to make your toddler happy: whenever he or she looks bored or is crying, everyone does their best to entertain or to calm them. You will find a great list of things to do with children during your Barcelona visit.\n\n\n=== Visitor information ===\n1 Tourist office at Pla\u00e7a de Catalunya, Pla\u00e7a de Catalunya, 17-S (Metro: L1, L3. Bus: 9, 22, 28, 42, 47, 58, 66, 67, 68. Train: R4). 08:30-20:30. This is the main tourist office in the city. (updated Oct 2015)\n Tourist office at Pla\u00e7a de Sant Jaume, Ciutat, 2 Ajuntament de Barcelona (City Hall). M-F 08:30-20:30, Sa 09:00-21:00, Su and public holidays 09:00-14:00. (updated Dec 2017)\n Tourist office at Estaci\u00f3 de Sants, Pla\u00e7a dels Pa\u00efsos Catalans (Metro: L5,L3. Bus: 63,68). Daily 08:00-20:00. (updated Dec 2017)\n Tourist office at Aeroport del Prat (Terminal 1 and 2.). Daily 09:00-21:00. (updated Dec 2017)\nAll tourist offices are closed on 1st January and 25th December. For a full list of tourist information points check the link above.\nThe department store El Corte Ingles publishes a free street map for tourists. You can pick a copy at the store, or at one of the many hotels in the city.\nThe Turisme de Barcelona site might be helpful.\n\n\n=== Tourist Passes ===\n Barcelona Card. This card gives free entry to more than 25 museums and other sites in Barcelona. For over 70 moresites it offers various kinds of discounts. It also includes a travel pass for public transport in Barcelona (for details see Hola BCN! card below). The card is available for purchase for periods of 2 to 5 days. If you don't plan to see lots of museums every day, then it may be cheaper to buy transport-only tickets (see below), and if you spend a lot of time in the largest museums, the Barcelona Art Passport may be better value. This card cannot be used on the cable cars or funiculars (except for Montju\u00efc). In general, if you plan to see only the famous highlights and don't visit museums, this card is not worth the hefty price or the hassle. Plenty of travel websites recommend and promote these kind of discount cards because they receive a commission. You should also remember that many museums offer free or discounted admission if you are over 65. From \u20ac27 for a Barcelona Card Express (2-day), up to \u20ac77.00 for a 5-day card (5% discount if bought online in advance); a version for children is available as well. (updated Mar 2024)\n Artiticket Barcelona (Art Passport), \u260f +34 934 439 470, info@articketbcn.org. This is an Art Passport covering six of the main art museums. Namely; MACBA; Museu Picasso; CCCB; Fundaci\u00f3 Antoni T\u00e0pies; Fundaci\u00f3 Joan Mir\u00f3; Museu Nacional d\u2019Art de Catalunya.   It is valid for one year and comes in a passport style book. It does not include any public transport. \u20ac38. (updated Mar 2024)\n Barcelona City Pass. a package that combines preferential skip the line tickets and use of the hop-on hop-off bus in Barcelona. This city pass package could save you money during your visit, only if you heavily use it. \u20ac85.00+. (updated Mar 2024)\n\n\n== Talk ==\n\nBarcelona's official languages are Catalan and Spanish. About a half prefer to speak Catalan, a vast majority understands it, and virtually everyone knows Spanish. However, most signs are indicated only in Catalan because it is established by law as the first official language. Yet, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities. Regular announcements in the Metro are made only in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese. On the other hand, FGC announcements \u2013 either regular or disruptions \u2013 will be made only in Catalan, and disruption announcements on RENFE's network will usually be made only in Spanish. As in most other cities, any attempt by visitors to use the native languages is always appreciated. Most locals are bilingual in Catalan and Spanish, and instinctively address foreigners in Spanish. Catalan is a separate Romance language, not a dialect, and sounds closer to Italian, Portuguese and French in many ways. Avoid referring to Catalan as a dialect, which will offend Catalans.\nYou might find some locals answer in Catalan after being asked in Spanish, that's not because they are being rude but because they assume you are bilingual. In Catalonia, it's not uncommon to hear people code switching between different languages in the same conversation. In case you can't understand what they are saying, tell them you don't speak Catalan and politely ask them to repeat it in Spanish or English.\nThe main cause of Spanish and Catalan social bilingualism in modern Catalonia is a large scale immigration process from the rest of Spain, which occurred over the 20th century, as Catalonia started a significant industrialization which demanded an increased workforce from elsewhere. 60% of the people in Catalonia use Spanish as their first language, and 40% use Catalan. The issues regarding language, national identity, and politics are like politics anywhere.\nIn tourist areas, almost all shops and bars have some English speaking staff. People will generally make an effort to try to help you if you speak English. If you are a native English speaker, you will have few problems, as Barcelona hosts many tourists.\n\n\n== Get in ==\n\n\n=== By plane ===\n\nThe main airport is 1 Barcelona El Prat (BCN IATA). Some low-cost carriers, notably Ryanair, use the airports of Girona (GRO IATA), nearly 100 km (62 mi) to the north, or Reus (REU IATA), around the same distance to the south, instead. Since Ryanair started operating at BCN, you should check carefully where your flight goes. The three-letter IATA code should be part of your booking process.\n\n\n==== Barcelona International Airport ====\nMain article: Barcelona El Prat Airport\nBarcelona International Airport (BCN IATA), also known as El Prat, is a major transport hub, with flights from all over Europe and beyond, is by far the closest airport to the city. To get to the city centre, there are different options. Both terminals have a metro station and the ticket machines before the turnstiles will sell you a Billet aeroport ticket to anywhere in the city by metro (only)for \u20ac5.70. You can also reach Barcelona's city centre by train or by bus with a T-casual on a T-mobilitat contactless card. This costs \u20ac12.55 for 10 journeys on any Suburban Train (Rodalies), metro (not from the airport), tram, or bus in the metropolitan area of Barcelona, and cannot be shared by more than one person. It is also much cheaper than the Aerobus (\u20ac7.25 for a single journey). The train leaves from Terminal 2, and there is a free shuttle from Terminal 1 to terminal 2. Trains run every 30 minutes until around midnight. If you arrive on a late flight, you can get into Barcelona using the N18 night bus, which stops at Pla\u00e7a d'Espanya on its way to Pla\u00e7a Catalunya. See the Public Transport section in Get Around below for more information on tickets & passes as there were major changes in 2023.\n\n\n==== Girona\u2013Costa Brava Airport ====\nThe Barcelona Bus service runs a shuttle bus from Estaci\u00f3 del Nord (which is walking distance to the Arc de Triomf metro stop) in Barcelona to Girona Airport, synchronised with various flight times. A one-way ticket costs \u20ac16 and a return ticket costs \u20ac25. The journey takes approximately 1 hour 10 minutes. Timetables are available online. You can also take a train (you can choose between local Rodalies, Media Distancia and high speed  AVE trains with different travel times and price points) to Girona main train station and a local bus from there to the airport.\n\n\n==== Reus Airport ====\nThe easiest way is to get there is to take the bus run by Hispano Igualadina from the Barcelona Sants bus station to the airport. Bus departures are synchronized with Ryanair plane departures/arrivals. One way ticket costs \u20ac13 and a return ticket costs \u20ac24. The journey takes from 1 hr 30 min to 1 hr 45 min, depending on the traffic on the motorway. Timetables are available online. A slightly cheaper, yet longer option is to take a train from Barcelona Sants station to Reus and then the local bus no. 50 to the airport. The train costs \u20ac7.25 and then the bus costs \u20ac2.5. This takes about 2\u00bd hours. Train timetables can be checked at Renfe's website and the bus timetable is available at the website of Reus public transport.\n\n\n=== By train ===\n\nBarcelona is well-connected to the Spanish railway network, and to the rest of Europe. High-speed trains run frequently from main station 2 Barcelona Sants  (in the southwest of the city) to Madrid, Seville and Malaga. There are also regular long-distance connections that partially use high-speed infrastructure to all major Spanish cities. The station is also served by many regional lines including  R1  R2  R2SUD  R2NORD  R3  R4  R11 \nThe historic 3 Estaci\u00f3 de Fran\u00e7a  now mostly serves regional trains.\nDirect regular high-speed train service goes to destinations in France. In addition to two daily TGV services from Paris (travel time ~7 hr to Barcelona), there is a daily service from Lyon (5 hr), and a daily service from Marseille (4 hr). Prices start at \u20ac39, so even though the train could take longer than a flight, it is often a cheaper, more relaxed alternative and less climately harmful option.\nThe former Talgo trains from Montpellier to Barcelona and Cartagena via Portbou ceased to run when direct high speed services started. It is still possible to travel via Cerb\u00e8re/Portbou using local trains, but it's cumbersome, painfully slow and timetable coordination at the border is awful; however it may be the only alternative if all TGVs are fully booked. Also, if booked in advance, TGV can be way cheaper than using these local trains. However, for travelers using Eurail and Interrail passes these local routes are a useful way to avoid the high additional reservation fees on the international TGVs, which can be almost as high as an advance-booked standalone ticket on some of the longer routes.\nThere is also a less-known rail line over the Pyrenees to Toulouse. There is roughly one train every 3 hours on the Spanish side and one every two or four on the French side, including a sleeper train from Paris (with a branch to Portbou which splits at Toulouse: check all timetables to see whether route is faster, it greatly depends on waiting times at the border). Purchasing tickets for this route can be tricky. The Spanish line is considered a commuter line despite being far away from Barcelona and does not appear in any global European timetable, so it is impossible to get an international CIV ticket, every portion must be purchased separately. Also, for southbound travel, the Latour-de-Carol station only sells SNCF tickets so the Spanish portion must be bought directly at the ticket inspector, cash only. The journey takes 7\u20138 hours (including transfer) and costs roughly \u20ac30.\nThe launch of the high-speed service spelled the end of the overnight sleeper-car service called Trenhotel between Barcelona and Paris. Trenhotels still do, however, run between Barcelona and Granada, A Coru\u00f1a and Vigo.\nThe security checks are taken seriously and may take some time. Arrive in advance, and do not bring anything that could be interpreted as potential weapon as it may be destroyed (knife, tools\u2026).\n\n\n=== By boat ===\nThe city's port is one of the busiest on the Mediterranean.\nLarge cruise ships dock 1\u20132 km (0.62\u20131.24 mi) to the southwest. Many of them offer bus-shuttles to locations at the south end of La Rambla. The ferries dock almost directly on the Ramblas.\nThere are regular ferry connections with the Balearic Islands (Alc\u00fadia, Ciutadella de Menorca, Ibiza City, Sant Antoni de Portmany, Mah\u00f3n, Palma de Mallorca), Italy (Genoa, Porto Torres and Civitavecchia for Rome) and Tangier, in Morocco. From Rome (Civitavecchia) it is actually cheaper to take the ferry than a bus.\nSome of the largest shipping companies includes Bale\u00e0ria, Grimaldi Lines and Trasmediterranea but there are several smaller companies as well.\n\n\n=== By bus ===\nAll bus connections are at 4 Barcelona del Nord  (Barcelona Nord, Estacion del Norte) station (\u260f +34 902 260 606). This includes national (e.g. 18 buses per day from Madrid) and international routes.\nFlixbus runs coach services between Barcelona Nord and London Victoria Coach Station, via Paris and Toulouse. They also connect to Amsterdam, Cologne, Brussels and many UK cities. They can be very cheap, but be prepared for a 24-26 hour coach ride from London! There is a small service fee. There may or may not be plug sockets or Wi-Fi on board. Flixbus recommend that you be at your departure point at least 30 minutes before departure time (except London Victoria where you are required to arrive 60 minutes before departure).\n\n\n=== By car ===\nSeveral main roads connect Barcelona to France and to the rest of Spain. Traffic is usually relatively light outside of peak hours. Free parking spaces can be found a few metro stops from the center of the city.\nBlue parking spaces are paid M-Sa 09:00-14:00 and 16:00-20:00. At some crossroads, the pay time starts at 08:00. Anyone can use a blue space, but they aren't that easy to find. You pay at the meter and put the ticket on the dashboard. Green parking spaces are for residents only. White parking spaces are free at all times, but there aren't any in the city centre.\nCity car parks are found throughout the city.\n\n\n== Get around ==\n\n\n=== By public transport ===\nThe public transport in the city and the surrounding area managed by Autoritat del Transport Metropolit\u00e0 (ATM) consortium who provide information about services by all operators. The whole area is covered by the Integrated Fare System, which is divided into 6 zones. This system includes the most of the public transport in the area: metro, city and intercity bus, tram and commuter trains. Like most major European cities Barcelona has moved to a rechargeable ticketing system called T-mobilitat..\nThe city limits of Barcelona are completely inside zone 1. The public transport in the city is mostly operated by Transports Metropolitans de Barcelona (TMB). They have a separate site dedicated for tourists. Other operators in Barcelona are Rodalies de Catalunya ; Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya(FGC) & Tram.\n\nT-mobilitat is a card or smartphone app that is the carrier of many of the contactless pass types below and can allow you to travel throughout the Barcelona metropolitan area.\nThere are three physical types.\n\nPersonal reloadable plastic card costing \u20ac4.50 that has to be registered. It is mainly aimed at local residents but people staying for an extended period may find it useful as it supports all pass types. If lost, it is possible to block the card and recover the passes on the card.\nAnonymous reloadable cardboard cards which cost \u20ac0.50 and can only support one pass at a time. They can support T-casual, T-familier or T-grup passes. T-usual passes are also available on this type of card but can only be reloaded with T-usual passes. This is low cost option aimed at less frequent users like tourists.\nNFC Smartphone app has a \u20ac1.00 registration fee. Supports all ticket types (but do you want to pull your phone out every time you want to validate a pass?)\nPasses & tickets available:\n\n Single ticket. A non-integrated ticket is valid only for single mode of transport of a specific operator: either bus, metro or funicular, etc. On buses you can use a contactless bank card without a physical ticket for one journey. \u20ac2.65. (updated Jan 2025)\nBillet aeroport Non-integrated ticket for use on the metro between any point on the metro system and the airport. There are other tickets that can be used on metro line 9 at the airport, see below. \u20ac5.70.\n Hola BCN! cards. For unlimited number of journeys for 2, 3, 4 or 5 days. They are valid for TMB metro and bus, tram, FGC and regional trains in the city and metropolitan area. You will find the T-casual and its sister passes better value. They are one of the passes valid on airport metro L9. not T-Mobilitat. 2-day card \u20ac18.10. (updated Jan 2025)\nIntegrated for a fixed number of journeys. Unfortunately these passes are not valid for travel to/from the airport by metro L9, but they are valid to/from the airport on the bus and train. All use T-mobilitat.\nT-casual. This pass is for a single-person for 10 single journeys. During each journey it's possible to make up to three transfers. The whole duration of a journey must be no more than 1hr 15min and within zone 1. The T-casual is the good option for tourists. It's more convenient than buying single tickets and better value than the single tickets for more than 4 trips. It's far cheaper than the various discount cards with free transportation option. And finally, it doesn't bind one to specific routes like the hop-on-hop-off buses. T-casual for Zone 1 \u20ac12.55.\nT-familier. Multi-person pass valid for 8 journeys, valid for 30 days. To correctly share this pass, the number of validations must match the number of people travelling together. T-familier for 1 zone \u20ac11.05\nT-grup. Multi-person pass for 70 journeys, valid for 30 days. To correctly share this pass, the number of validations must match the number of people travelling together.  T-grup for zone 1  \u20ac87.35\nIntegrated for an unlimited number of journeys for a number of days. These passes are valid for travel from the Airport on the Metro L9.\nT-dia Single-person pass with an unlimited number of integrated journeys for 24 hours. Only one round trip to/from the airport on the metro L9 is allowed. T-dia for zone 1 \u20ac11.55. (not issued on T-mobilitat)\nT-usual Non-transferable single-person pass with an unlimited number of journeys on any means of transport within the integrated system, for 30 consecutive days as of the first use, for the number of zones purchased. You must enter your passport or identity card number when purchasing these passes and you must carry the identity document when using the pass. T-usual for zone 1 \u20ac22.00 (discounted price during 2025). If loaded onto a cardboard T-mobilitat card, only T-usual cards can be reloaded onto the card. This pass is not valid for travel to/from the airport on metro L9.\nThe discount on T-usual cards has been extended into 2025 so may be worth considering for longer stays.\nAn operator independent travel planner is available on the Barcelona Government website. There is a tendency for operators to emphasise their own services on their maps.\n\n\n===== By metro =====\nThe Metro (subway) is an efficient way of getting around town. Operation times are 05:00\u201324:00 (M\u2013Th), 05:00\u201302:00 (F), and continuous service from Saturday at 05:00 until Sunday at midnight. Stations are marked  on most maps; every station has a detailed map of exits to the city. Trains are fast, often coming in two minute intervals. However, on holidays and weekends trains only run every 6-8 minutes and can get easily packed. Announcements are made only in Catalan, though signs and ticketing machines generally include Spanish and English too.\n\nPay attention to the fact that to get from metro lines operated by TMB ( L1 ,  L2 ,  L3 ,  L4 ,  L5 ,  L9 / L10  and  L11 ) to the ones operated by FGC ( L6 ,  L7  and  L8 ), or vice versa, you need to exit and then enter through a new pay-gate. In this case, if you had a one-journey ticket, you need to get a new one. If you used a multiple journey ticket you won't be charged for a second time when changing lines as long as you are within the stated travel time for a single journey. Also, you can't repeat operator, so you can't use a FGC ride to make a shortcut. For instance: changing to L9S to L1 via L8 using Fira and Espanya will charge you with two journeys, you should go via Torrassa instead although its way longer. All trains are air-conditioned, but the metro stations themselves are not, so beware because the stations can become very hot during summer months.\nAlso be aware when travelling to/from the airport by Metro line L9 Sud: while the T-casual is valid for   R2NORD  Renfe services (or buses), it is not accepted for the  Metro. If you use the Metro line L9 Sud to and from the airport using a T-casual ticket, you'll be forced to pay the full fare, which is \u20ac5.50, and the ticket you've used will not be refunded.\n\n\n==== By tram ====\nThere are two main sets of tram lines, Trambaix  T1  T2  T3  towards the North West of the city and Trambes\u00f2s  T4  T5  T6  towards the East of the city near the coast. There are interchange points with other modes of transport. These lines are run by Tram  and all lines are in zone 1.\nThere is one other tramway run by TMB but is not part of the integrated ticketing system: Tramvia Blau. This is a historic tram that connects to the Tibidabo Funecular. Unfortunately in 2024 it is closed for maintenance with bus 196 available as a replacement.\n\n\n==== By train ====\nRegional suburban trains run through Barcelona and share ticketing with the modes of transport above. There are two operators: RENFE and FGC. Wrongly ignored by some tourists, they provide a useful additional mode of transport for getting across the city or connecting with mainline rail services and the airport.\nThe trains run by RENFE share tracks with mainline trains and are called Rodalies  (known in the rest of Spain as Cercan\u00edas). They operate lines  R1  R2SUD  R2  R2NORD  R3  R4  R7  R8 . NOTE that the integrated system map shows fare zones that do not coincide with the integrated transport zones of different transportation companies but the integrated fare Zone 1 is shown with the addition of the airport T2 station on  R2NORD . However, due to chronic underfunding severe disruptions are more the norm than the exception (as of March 2025, the service on line R3 had been completely suspended, without expectations of either restoration the same day or any replacement services), so seriously consider other alternatives before choosing RENFE-operated trains.\nThe trains run by FGC   are  S1  S2  S3  S4  S8  S9  and some are confusingly prefixed with an R   R5  R50  R6  R60 . In addition FGC operates  L6  L7  L8  but these are considered to be part of the Barcelona metro.\nWatch out, it is possible to travel beyond integrated fare Zone 1 on both systems. There is a good map on the FGC website showing all rail lines and the boundary of Zone 1.\n\n\n==== By bus ====\n\nThe bus network in Barcelona is pretty extensive. Perhaps the best option in planning your route is to consult with one of the route planners mentioned above.\nA major reorganisation of bus lines was completed in November 2018, so disregard old bus schedules and recheck routes. For example, bus line 92 to Park G\u00fcell, used by many tourists to get there after a visit to the Sagrada Familia, has been suspended, and a new line V15 stops there but takes a different route through the city centre (Passeig de Sant Joan).\nHere are some tips for bus line codes:\n\nHxx lines run parallel to the coastline, low numbers run on the high side, high numbers on the sea side.\nVxx lines run from the beach to the hills, high numbers on the northern side (Bes\u00f2s), low numbers on the southern (Llobregat).\nDxx lines run in a somewhat diagonal path, although interestingly none of these cover neither Diagonal or Meridiana avenues, the main oblique streets.\nMxx lines are found at the outer perimeter of metro coverage and link a metro stop to a neighbourhood lacking metro service.\nBxx lines run on the northern area outside Barcelona or linking Barcelona to neighbouring municipalities in the metropolitan area, B stands for Bes\u00f2s river.\nLxx lines run on the southern area alike Bxx lines, L stands for Llobregat river.\nSome municipalities have lines fully inside the town limits with two letters and a digit, theses two letters are reminiscent of the town name, such as BDx for Badalona and LHx for L'Hospitalet\nNxx lines run only at night when all other lines do not run, roughly from 23:00 to 6:00.\nCxx lines link Barcelona the various northern coastal Maresme towns up to Matar\u00f3.\nExx lines are express buses from Barcelona to various municipalities 10\u201360 km (6.2\u201337.3 mi) outside of the metropolitan area.\nLines with one or two digits without any letter follow historical routes from before the H-V-D schema.\nLines between 100 and 199 are usually very local lines served with low-capacity cars and poor frequency, 30 min or worse. Notable cases are line 111 to the Tibidabo amusement park, line 120 through Ciutat Vella, and line 150 to Olympic venues and the Montju\u00efc castle; others are mostly useless for tourists.\nLine numbers from 200 upwards are used for some routes going outside the metropolitan area, while some others of the same kind have no number at all.\nBuses H-V-D run about every 6\u201312 min weekdays, 15\u201320 min weekends. \nNitbus (N) run every 20 min all night. Information is available from AMB All Nitbuses (except N0 & N19) start or pass through Pl Catalunya\nTake note that some lines have special fare restrictions: Barcelona cards (unlimited travel for 2 to 5 days) are valid only on Hxx, Vxx, Dxx and line numbers below 200. Fare 1 travelcards are not valid for Cxx, Exx and line numbers above 200 \u2013 actually, trips fully inside fare zone 1 are not permitted on these lines no matter what ticket is used. If you board any of these buses inside fare zone 1 you won't be able to get off until reaching another fare zone.\n\n Barcelona Bus Tur\u00edstic. This bus has three routes (map provided as you board), including a northbound and a southbound line that leave from opposite sides of the Pla\u00e7a de Catalunya. Each takes 1\u20132 hours. The hop-on/hop-off format lets you get-off at any interesting stop, see what interests you, then get back on any later bus at that or any other stop. One approach is stay on for an entire route, then continue while getting off at locations that interested you earlier. Buses are double-decked, with the open-air upper deck offering much better views \u2013 but sunscreen is essential in summer months, jackets in winter, early spring and late autumn. Earphones are offered when you first get on so you can hear the commentary as you drive by significant locations. Outlets near every seat let you choose among many languages and playback volumes. The buses are very frequent. For a cheaper option with more flexibility in routes opt for the metro and the T-casual. Adult prices: 1 day ticket \u20ac33, 2 days \u20ac44; tickets can be bought at the bus stops, some hotels, etc. or online with 10% discount.

Doing so may subject one to hefty fines, as well as frequent, audible disdain from pedestrians. Electric scooters are permitted in bicycle lanes, and may share the road with automobiles.\n\nMattia46 scooters for rent: 50cc to 200cc.\nGoCar is a two-seater, 3 wheeled vehicle that runs with a 49cc engine. It is legally classified as a scooter to drive on the roads. The GoCars were created with the purpose of being rented to tourists as a different way to see a city.\nCooltra Motos Scooter rental. You can rent a moped for 1 day up to 1 month. You can also take a part in private or group tours.\nBookYourMoto Scooter and motorcycle rental in Barcelona. Cheap motorbike hire in Barcelona.\n\n\n=== By bicycle ===\nBarcelona also has its own shared bike system, called BiCiNg. However, this is only accessible to locals. Mainly in the Western parts of the city, these are replaced by Ambici bikes - while non-residents can sign up, the conditions are not overly attractive (significant annual fee and rental prices encourage short-time rentals).\n\nDonkey Republic. The orange bikes of Donkey Republic are placed all around the city. Tourists can rent and unlock the bikes via the company's app 24 hours a day, which can lock and unlock the bike by Bluetooth. Bikes start at \u20ac12 per day.\nBolt offers app-based ebike rentals, however the number of bikes is limited.\nRidemovie offers app-based rentals.\nPerry Tours - Bike Tours Barcelona Perry Tours offers daily guided bike tours in Barcelona with English and Dutch guides, providing a fun and unique way to explore the city's highlights and experience its lively atmosphere.

(updated May 2015)\n\n\n=== On foot ===\nBarcelona is a very walkable city. It takes little over an hour to walk from Port Vell at the seaside to Park G\u00fcell at the foothills of the mountain range at the northeastern end of the city, and you can see a range of attractions, including La Rambla and Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, on your way. There are opportunities all around to sit down and enjoy a drink or a meal everywhere. If you are fit, you can pretty much explore the city by foot alone, unless the heat beats you in the warmer months (and then you can always resort to the air-conditioned metro).\n\n\n=== By car ===\nParking around all major tourist destinations is expensive (\u20ac3/hour, \u20ac20-36/day) and the spaces are difficult to navigate, as there are several classes of public parking spaces, with complicated rules for each class. Barcelona is plagued with the same problems that plague other major European cities; massive traffic jams and extremely narrow streets in some areas, coupled with a very complicated road system. As such, driving yourself around is not recommended for tourists, especially those with no driving experience in large cities. Public transport will get you to all the major areas, and you should use that as your main mode of transport.\nHaving a driving map is essential - plan your route before you set off. Navigating with an average tourist map is frequently misleading: many streets are one-way; left turns are more rare than rights (and are unpredictable). As an example, Gran via de Les Corts Catalanes is actually a one-way northbound street between Espanya and Marina, the opposite direction is reserved for buses and taxis only.\nSome free parking spots reported by travelers are:\n\nNear Moll de Sant Bertran (which is south-west from Museu Maritim) - driving at B\u201310, exit to WTC and make a complete round at roundabout, heading to warehouses - and park next to its employees cars.\nSomewhere near Guell Park.\nNear Font M\u00e0gica, in Pla\u00e7a Espanya and the Montju\u00efc hill.\nGetting around by car makes sense if you plan to spend much more time driving outside the city borders than inside it - and ideally if you don't plan to park overnight at all. Otherwise, for purely in-city transportation, consider renting a scooter, or using public transportation instead.\n\n\n=== By taxi ===\nAs of January 2019, ride-sharing services such as Uber require at least one hour's notice. For less than one hour's notice, you need to call a regular taxi.\n\n\n== See ==\n\nIndividual listings can be found in Barcelona's district articles\n\n\n=== The old city ===\nWalk around the winding streets and hidden squares, fountains and palaces in the Barri G\u00f2tic (Ciutat Vella).

It takes you to all the best Modernisme (art nouveau) buildings in Barcelona. The main part of the route can be walked in a couple of hours, if you don't stray too far from the main routes. The Tourist Offices offer a pack that includes discounted tickets to many attractions such as La Pedrera and La Casa Batll\u00f3. All can be seen from the outside for free.\n\n\n=== With children ===\nMuseum of Natural History in the Forum - Museu Blau\nCosmoCaixa: Museum of Science Amazing museum for kids from 4-5 upwards.

Jun-Aug 11:00-20:00; Mar-May, Sep-Oct 11:00-19:00; Nov-Feb 11:00-17:30. Have a ride at Port Vell Aerial Tramway. Port Vell Aerial Tramway is the 1450-metre-long harbour aerial tramway with red cars connects Montju\u00efc and Barceloneta. It starts in Barceloneta on the top of the 78-metre-tall 6 Torre San Sebastian  tower, which has also a restaurant at its top accessible by an elevator. It has an intermediate stop at 7 Torre Jaume I  tower (close to Columbus monument), which can be reached by elevator from ground \u2013 107 metre tall tower, the second-tallest aerial tramway support tower in the world. The final point of the line is Miramar on the slopes of Montju\u00efc hill. Overall, the whole system is quite old (built in 1929, albeit restored a couple of times), and the car is packed with tourists during the daytime \u2013 particularly sensitive for a stroller or a wheelchair. But if you start from the Montju\u00eec side, there are fewer people waiting. single \u20ac11, return \u20ac16.50; it's not a part of Barcelona's integrated fare network.   (updated Oct 2015)\nStroll along the following famous streets in Ciutat Vella:\n1 La Rambla  (Las Ramblas), a gorgeous tree-lined pedestrian walkway, the busiest and most lively street of the city. Mostly occupied by tourists, expect to pay higher prices for food and drink. Avoid the groups of people supposedly betting on a game played on a cardboard table \u2013 they are thieves. Head off into some of the side streets for a cheaper, more local, and authentic experience of Barcelona. Often called Las Ramblas, because it is a series of several different streets each called 'Rambla de ____', the sections also have distinct feels. As you get closer to Pla\u00e7a Catalunya, you find more street performers doing stunts. In the middle, you'll find street performers in costumes. Towards the pier, there are artists who will do pencil drawings, paintings, etc.\n2 Pla\u00e7a de Catalunya . Connecting all the major streets in the city, the Pla\u00e7a is known for its fountains and statues, and the central location to everything in the city. A favourite meeting spot for locals.\n3 Portal de l'\u00c0ngel . Large pedestrian walkway with many new and stylish shops in which to browse.\nCruise miles of beachfront boardwalk starting from Barceloneta, or get a tan on the beach. Eat good seafood and rice dishes at La Barceloneta neighbourhood\nSit on a wooden bridge to Maremagnum in Ciutat Vella and cool your toes at the water's edge with a book, sandwich, or just for a short rest.\nWander the Barri Gotic in Ciutat Vella, the largely intact medieval centre of the city and visit the Cathedral and its wonderful cloister.\nEnjoy your Sangria at La Pla\u00e7a Reial in Ciutat Vella, near La Rambla Street. Great place to sit, relax, and drink. (People from Barcelona do not drink sangria, it's just a tourist drink! But you can enjoy it anyway!)\nWalk in El Born neighbourhood in Ciutat Vella, a former very popular area with great restaurants and places to have a few drinks. If your accommodation is on Rambla, El Born is a great place to enjoy a more relaxed atmosphere, and find more creative shops and craftsmen. El Born means jousting field, and its history and stories can fill one of those huge books stored in old libraries. There are interesting and quirky details to uncover while walking around, such as the name given to its streets, the medieval signs to brothels, and remnants of the secession war of the end of the 18th century. Indulge yourself at Hofman or Bub\u00f3 bakeries and make sure you visit the Santa Maria del Mar church.\nVisit a Flamenco Show in a real tablao. One of the best is Tablao de Carmen in Sants-Montju\u00efc. A cheaper alternative is in the jazzclub Jazz Si in Ciutat Vella. (Although Flamenco is mostly just a touristy activity, Catalan people are not into flamenco. It's a dance and music from Andaluc\u00eda, the south-east region in Spain)\n Cable car. Ride the Cable Way to get from the sea front to Montju\u00efc mountain in Sants-Montju\u00efc. \u20ac12.78.

Their local Derbi barcelon\u00ed has political undertones, as FC Barcelona is associated with the Catalan independence movement, while Espanyol is seen as pro-Spanish unity and anti-Catalan independence. These clubs are active also in other sports, such as handball and basketball.\nFC Barcelona are the famous club, known for their iconic and politically-charged El Cl\u00e1sico rivalry with Real Madrid, playing in La Liga the top tier at Camp Nou (capacity 99,000), 1 km west of Sants railway station. Nearest Metro is Palau Reial. Their women's team plays in Liga F, their top tier, at Johan Cruyff Stadium west edge of the city.\nRCD Espanyol were relegated in 2023 so they play in Segunda Divisi\u00f3n the second tier. Their RCDE Stadium (capacity 40,500) is at the western edge of the city. No metro, take a bus towards Ave del Baix Llobregat.\n4 Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya is a motor-racing circuit hosting Grand Prix / Formula One and other big events. It's in the northern suburb of Montmel\u00f3. The next F1 races are 30 May - 1 June 2025.\nBasketball : The FC Barcelona Basketball Team. Its name is FC Barcelona B\u00e8squet, which belongs to the Euroleague and Liga ACB. Its home stadium is Palau Blaugrana, located next to campnu.\n\n\n=== Festivals and events ===\n\nBarcelona hosts a number of annual fiestas, many of which are unique to Catalonia and offer an insight into its distinctive culture.\n\n S\u00f3nar. An annual three-day music festival. It is described officially as a festival of Advanced Music and Multimedia Art. Music is by far the main aspect of the festival. The festival runs for three days and nights, usually starting on a Thursday in the third week of June. There is a day location and a night location. \u20ac52 daypass, \u20ac76 night entry, \u20ac199 festival pass on internet booking, higher fees for entrance passes.   \n Monegros Desert Festival. The most famous and biggest one day/night electronic music festivals in Spain is in the desert of Fraga, 200 km (120 mi) from Barcelona. More than 40,000 people gather every July to celebrate electronic music with the best DJs representing styles from house, electro, minimal, techno, to drum&bass, dubstep, and hiphop. 20 hours non-stop, it is a unique desert experience.  \n5 Festes de la Merc\u00e8. Barcelona's main annual festival around 24 September, encompassing many events such as human towers (castellers), free live music events on the streets, firework displays, and processions of wooden giants. It is a holiday and the city offers a lot of activities to have fun. Enjoy a fountains and fireworks show at the base of the Montju\u00efc hill.   \n6 Festes de Gr\u00e0cia. The Festes de Gracia is a Catalonian celebration, held around 15 August each year to commemorate the Assumption. During the week of festivities that mark one of Barcelona's most important fiestas, the city of Gracia explodes with fun, excitement, colour, and fireworks. Many streets are decorated by neighbours, and there is live music, food in the streets, and the parties continue all night.  \n7 Festes de Sants. Similar to Gracia's event, but smaller and later on in August. If you can't go to Gracia's event, try to go to this festival.  \n Sant Jordi. 23 April. Considered to be like Valentine's Day. People give roses and books around the streets. Traditionally, men give women roses and women give men books. It is one of the most popular and interesting celebrations in Catalonia. \n Corpus. Late in May (Corpus Christi day). An egg shell is placed over the jet of water coming out of various fountains such that the egg \"magically dances\" over the water. These fountains typically are beautifully decorated with flowers and are mostly at churches, most of which are located in the city centre: Cathedral's cloister, Santa Anna, Casa de l'Ardiaca, Museu Frederic Mar\u00e9s, and a dozen other fountains. \n Fira de Santa Ll\u00facia. From 2/3 December to 23 December, to commemorate St. Ll\u00facia (13 December). During this time, in front of the Cathedral, Christmas objects are sold. Some places sell Christmas trees, but most of them sell elements for making the pessebres (Nativity scenes). These include small sculptures, wooden pieces, and moss used to simulate grass. 13 December is the feast day of Santa Llucia, patron saint of fashion designers and blind people, who gather at the Santa Llucia chapel in the cathedral to pay their respects.  \n Barcelona Jazz Festival. A brighter way to celebrate the colder Autumn days, the annual Jazz festival has been running for nearly 50 years now and runs roughly from the last week in October and all the way through November Tickets prices differ for each event. \n Revetlla de Sant Joan. This is the midsummer solstice celebration. It is celebrated on 23 June every year and is signified by the fireworks (there are frequent and loud amateur fireworks all night long, which may make it hard to sleep) that are permanently on display during this time. \n Fira de Barcelona. There are trade events all year round in Barcelona.   \n\n\n== Learn ==\n\nFor those wishing to make a real attempt at learning the language, there are plenty of Catalan and Spanish language schools in Barcelona.\n\n2 University of Barcelona, \u260f +34 934 035 478.   \n3 Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona, \u260f +34 93 581 13 25.   \n4 Pompeu Fabra University, \u260f +34 93 542 14 17.   \n5 Universitat Ramon Llull, \u260f +34 93 602 22 00.   \n6 ESADE Business School.   \n Don Quijote.

In Ciutat Vella you will find plenty of small fashion shops, souvenir shops and small supermarkets open on Sundays. The souvenir shopping scattered throughout the Barri Gotic and all along La Rambla are tourist traps, none of them sell Catalan or Spanish products but the typical array of Chinese general souvenirs, they should be avoided. Moreover on the Port Vell, right at the end of The Ramblas there is Maremagnum, a shopping mall that stays open all Sundays.\nIf you see people selling items on the street on a blanket, do not buy from them. The products are often of dubious origin and low quality, and are often the result of human trafficking.\n\nSecondhand English books in Gr\u00e0cia.\nDesign lovers head for Gr\u00e0cia.\n El Corte Ingl\u00e9s. Spanning several floors and several buildings, and in several locations around town, many in Eixample and Inland Suburbs and a couple also in Ciutat Vella.

See review for the whole chain in the Spain article. \n1 La Boqueria (Mercat Sant Josep). In Ciutat Vella. Large public market with a diverse range of goods and produce. Enjoy freshly squeezed organic fruit juices for \u20ac1.5 per cup. If you go near closing time (20:00) sellers will make you a special price (2 or 3 for \u20ac2). Closed Sundays.   \nStamps are actually sold in 'Tabacs' or tobacconists. Once you know what they look like, you'll notice them on every block or so. To post your mail, you need to find one of the rare yellow letter boxes along the sidewalks.\nRecords For vinyl records, try the wonderful shop Discos Revolver at 13 Carrer dels Tallers.\nSupermarkets are spread across the city. Bon\u00c0rea, Bonpreu and Condis are the most popular supermarket chains from Catalonia. Mercadona, Consum, and Dia are other popular chains from the rest of Spain. All of them are a cost-effective way to purchase grocery items. There are also organic/specialty supermarkets like Casa Ametller or Veritas which are pricier. Small corner stores are the most visible on city streets, but tend to mark up prices in exchange for convenience.\n\n\n== Eat ==\nAs with all cities which welcome large numbers of tourists, Barcelona's cuisine is inconsistent in quality, but there are plenty of restaurants serving excellent food at very reasonable prices, if you know where to look. The usual rules of thumb apply: to save money and get better food, look for places off the beaten track used by fellow travellers, and seek out caf\u00e9s and restaurants which the locals frequent. In practice, this usually involves searching out eateries in residential districts away from the main sightseeing attractions. Avoid restaurants with touts outside, and have a basic understanding of the traditional foods served in restaurants, as well as the local drinks. One slightly crafty way of sussing a place's authenticity at a glance is to take note of how they spell a certain word: a menu board advertising tapas, written the Spanish/international way, is likely to be somewhere which primarily caters to tourists, whereas somewhere offering tapes, using Catalan spelling, is in all probability a venue frequented by locals.\nSome districts to check out include Gr\u00e0cia, which is a hub of quality, affordable Catalan cooking of both the traditional and more avant-garde varieties, and the Eixample, whose chic boulevards have upscale restaurants aplenty worthy of your splurge money. The fishing quarter of Barceloneta (in Ciutat Vella) is an example of a neighbourhood where it pays to be picky: closer to the gentrified seafront, a slew of mojito beach bar-style places serve up expensive tourist tapas; for the real thing, head into the backstreets, where many traditional bars are still tucked away. In all cases, be prepared to \"promenade\" in search of the most attractive-looking menu; that's what the locals do, after all.\n\nSet menus (men\u00fa del migdia / men\u00fa del d\u00eda) Most restaurants (and some bars) offer a men\u00fa del migdia / men\u00fa del d\u00eda (menu of the day), which usually means a three course meal (a first plate often a salad or rice-based or pasta-based dish, a second plate usually a meat or fish, and a drink; plus a dessert or coffee), 3 or 4 options for each course, for \u20ac12 to \u20ac20, depending on the restaurant. The portions may be quite generous, or rather small. During the week, some smart restaurants offer lunch specials from 14:00 to 16:00. The savvy traveller will try the hip places for a fraction of the price during the day.\nIf you're looking for a place where everyone can choose their own meal, ask for restaurants that serve platos combinados, which is the closest thing to an American/Northern European meal.\nSmoking is not permitted inside bars and restaurants since 2011, but it's usually allowed in terraces.\n\n\n=== Dishes ===\n\nYou can get food from any part of the world in Barcelona, but make sure you try some Catalan food.\nSee Catalan cuisine section in the Catalonia article.\nThe selection of seafood is consistently great, although not a lot of it is local (this part of the Mediterranean is pretty well fished-out).\nA treat to try that no travel guide mentions is waffles sold at street stands. They will tempt you with their mouth watering smell and taste.\nTapas restaurants are now all over the city (although tapas originated in Andalusia in the south of Spain). Each Spanish region has its native tapas; signature 'Catalonia' tapas is delicious. Some Catalans eat a more French-style three course meal (appetizer, main dish and dessert) and would more likely go for a pre-meal beer/vermouth and some snacks (olives, chips, etc.); others go for a meal entirely of tapas.  This pre-meal snack is called 'fer el vermut' or 'making the vermouth'. As you travel to smaller towns in Catalonia outside of Barcelona, it is less likely that you will find tapas and more likely you'll see restaurants serving traditional Catalan food in three courses.\nBeyond Catalan food, there is no shortage of durum or shawarma stands in Barcelona, offering tasty beef or chicken and salad in toasted flatbread for around \u20ac5. Gyros are delicious! You can also consider the Asian selection, with a lot of Chinese, Japanese and Indian restaurants. As with anywhere else, there are plenty of Italian restaurants, while Latin American offerings, particularly Argentine and Mexican, are well-represented too.\n\n\n=== Food tours ===\nIf you feel lost in the variety of food choices there are \u2013 Catalan, Basque, Spanish, and beyond \u2013 it may be helpful to do a food tour to quickly get oriented. Many independent tour operators run food and wine tours in the city.\n\n Barcelona Eat Local Food Tours, Hurtado 28 Barcelona, 08022, \u260f +1 800 656 0713. A family-owned business that showcases the best of Catalan gastronomy in off-the-beaten districts of Barcelona. (updated Apr 2017)\n\n\n=== Areas to eat ===\nDepending on where you are in the city, there may be restaurants galore, or none at all. The following areas tend to be restaurant \"hubs\", with a large variety of restaurants to choose from:\n\nBarceloneta: A popular quarter for locals, where you can try fish based dishes, such as Paella (a name that may hide many different kinds of rice concoctions) or Arr\u00f2s negre (Black Rice), that takes its colour because it is made using squid ink. Barceloneta is a very good place to eat tapas as well.\nSant Antoni is the new addition to the culinary scene in Barcelona where old and trendy cuisine mingle.\nEixample Esquerra (between Gran Via and Mallorca)\nBarri G\u00f2tic (especially for tapas)\n\"El Born\" (next to Barri G\u00f2tic)\nAround Pla\u00e7a Catalunya there are dozens of restaurants serving tapas. One should be careful with the tourist traps as the area is highly populated with tourists.\nFor budget eating you may choose \"men\u00fa del migdia\" in small bars on the Avinguda del Parallel for \u20ac9-11 per person. Be aware that sometimes the menu and the staff are only in Spanish.\nThe large cafes that line the Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia and the Rambla Catalunya, just north of the Pla\u00e7a Catalunya, offer a variety of acceptable tapas. This part of the town is quite touristy and a bit expensive.\n\n\n=== Groceries ===\nIn several supermarkets you can find a wide stall with a great selection of ready-to-eat dishes. You can get a two-course lunch for less than \u20ac5.\n\n\n=== Restaurants ===\nIndividual listings can be found in Barcelona's district articles\n Comer y no Bombas (Location is variable). Shares free vegan food. \nJuice bars. More and more the city is being populated by bars that serve organic/vegan food and cold-pressed juices.\n El Glop. Three locations, in Eixample and Gr\u00e0cia. Excellent mid-range Catalan meals. Allow about \u20ac20 per person, although you could get out of there for half of that if you let the price dictate your choice of dishes. \n\n\n== Drink ==\nIndividual listings can be found in Barcelona's district articles\n\n\n=== Cafes ===\nTry a \"caf\u00e9 con hielo\" an espresso served with a glass of ice cubes on the side in any local 'cafeteria'. Cafes are found on each corner in Barcelona, and these days a conscious movement in favour of top quality coffee is changing the scene in the Catalan capital with a new trend in terms of coffee houses.\n\n\n=== Bars ===\nChupitos are found in several locations throughout the city, including one in Barceloneta. Chupitos is Spanish for \"shots\" and offers hundreds of unique shots including the \"Harry Potter\" (a shot that sparks as cinnamon is sprinkled over it), and \"Monica Lewinsky\" (a variety of flaming shots) among others. As much a show as it is a place to get a drink, it's a fun night out.\n\n\n== Sleep ==\n\nBarcelona offers a great range of accommodations, from cheap, decent apartments, hostels and guest-houses to five-star hotels. Every district has plentiful offerings, and thanks to the efficient public transportation you can stay comfortably in any of them, depending on your budget and preferences.\nDuring festivals (see Festivals and events above), especially during Mobile World Congress, which is a major trade show at the Fira, accommodation in Barcelona and especially near the Fira is much more difficult to find and more expensive than usual.\n\nCiutat Vella offers a mix of luxury hotels and cheerful hostels within a dense urban environment. Staying there means being at the heart of Barcelona's nightlife - which is both lively and noisy.\nEixample and Gr\u00e0cia and Sants-Montju\u00efc are calmer, but quite as dense, and popular due to closeness to attractions. You will find more mid-market properties there.\nSant Mart\u00ed contains most of Barcelona's beaches and a string of very modern hotels along the Diagonal\nThe suburbs are not as far away as you may think thanks to the metro and local railway. Some hillside hotels offer great views, but may be far away from public transit though.\nSee the district articles for detailed listings of accommodation opportunities. \n\n\n== Connect ==\nBarcelona has 5G from all Spanish carriers. Wi-Fi is widely available in public places and on transport.\n\n\n== Stay safe ==\n\n\n=== Pickpockets ===\nPickpocketing is the most pressing issue for visitors to Barcelona. Never keep your wallet, cash or important documents in trouser pockets or in bag pockets: a money belt is an easy and inexpensive way to prevent being robbed. You will almost certainly be scoped out several times during your trip if you're in a tourist area or clearly don't fit in as a local, and it only takes a single momentary slip-up to lose your possessions. As always, be alert in crowded places, such as public transport, train and bus stations, La Rambla and Raval. If you are in a crowd, beware of anyone suspiciously or with no intention deliberately coming close to you.\nPickpockets usually work with more than one people, with one person using all kinds of tricks to distract you as their accomplices take action. The following are a few common methods:\n\nAt certain tourist hotspots, there are people who will try to show you a 'magic trick'. This involves tying a piece of string around your finger. While you are distracted (and your arm is effectively disabled), your wallet is stolen.\nA milky or unpleasant liquid might be thrown on you. Strangers will come out of nowhere to help you clean it up. If this happens, immediately walk away, you are being pickpocketed.\nEast Asian visitors are interrupted by touts, who will showcase their \"martial arts\" on you by kicking your leg. While you are distracted, you will have been pickpocketed.\nThese people may also pose as a person looking for spare change, policemen who wishes to check your wallet for ID, or as tourists asking for directions.\nMale travelers may be grabbed in the testicles by prostitutes or young female thieves. They will grab valuable possessions at the same time.\nIn the subway, a group of men will come out of seemingly nowhere while you attempt to enter a subway car and block your entrance and exit in a coordinated manner, effectively pinning you against the doors. They will act as if the car is just crowded and they are trying to get on as well, but, in reality, they have already gone through your pockets. They will quickly return to the platform just as the doors are closing, making you effectively trapped in the departing train. A more serious crime includes a person deliberately jamming the entry gate by inserting his subway card just as you are about to pass. His accomplice tries to 'help' you as the others are on your back snatching your items.\nUnder no circumstances should you leave your items unattended. While you are eating outside, a guy may babble near you asking for change with an unreadable poster in his hands and getting closer and closer to your smartphone until he eventually picks it up and passes it to a second guy that will run away with it. If you have a backpack or bag, don't place it on the ground without wrapping the loops around your leg or attaching it to the table using an S-Hook. Do not ask your friends to watch your luggage, thieves see ripe targets in people carrying too many bags, and will grab a carry-on bag and run.\nIf you need a police report to make an insurance claim for your stolen possessions, you can file a report online if you have no leads or witnesses. Police services generally expect you to provide a valid serial number to substantiate a theft allegation for electronic devices.\n\n\n=== Scams ===\nSee also: Common scams\nPeople in Barcelona are often very friendly and love to practice their English, so don't be unfriendly. That said, you should be suspicious if someone approaches you in a touristy area speaking your language and asking you for help. This should put your guard up immediately. Do not be tempted to sign their petition, give them directions, or help them with their problem. You don't know anything about where you are, since you're a tourist, so you won't be able to help them in any case.\nProfessional scam artists exhibiting a high degree of coordination are active in many areas of the city. Be careful in tourist areas. A variety of methods are employed, including the No-change trick. A common scam involves fake cops who will show up ask to see your passport, then take your belongings at the first opportunity. The story varies, but they are almost certainly not real ones. When it happens, the best strategy is to just walk away instead of starting any sort of conversations with them. Another trick is that one seemingly confused person will ask you for directions, diverting your attention and then suddenly fake police will appear asking for your ID. This is a co-ordinated move to divert the attention and steal whatever is possible. If such incident happens, just walk away, without listening to any of their conversation.  Stay alert, especially in busy tourist area near the Sants station and Pla\u00e7a d'Espanya.\nAnother popular scam happens in the metro. A group of scammers (often middle-aged women) will take advantage of the fuss while people are entering the metro and surround a tourist, frantically asking for directions. Most tourists won't know what to say while one of the scammers empties their pockets. They will try to confuse the tourist while the metro stays in the platform, and will get out just before the doors are closed. When you realize you've been scammed, the train will have already left and they will be safely outside with your belongings.\nThe bird excrement scam is also common. One or more accomplices will secretly spray or throw a smelly liquid on you. When you look up thinking a passing bird has pooped on you, they will run up to you and tell you that they saw a bird poop on you. They will offer to help you clean up, and while you are cleaning they will go through your pockets and any bags you have set down. It is wise to beware of anyone who is attempting to touch a complete stranger.\nA version of Three Card Monte is one of many common scams played on Les Rambles. There are also people holding petitions to install a wheelchair lift in locations with a lot of stairs. Once your signature is obtained they will then aggressively ask for a donation. Sometimes there can be crowds of children demanding money with hardly anyone else in the area, making it difficult to get away.\nBesides, in the square where the Barcelona Cathedral is located, there are female scammers who dress up as mimes (with their face painted white) to rob tourists, telling them that they are selling the balloons they carry or even asking them to take a picture together to grab their belongings. The best option is not to approach them and go away in case they approach you.\n\n\n=== Violent crimes ===\nIn 2019 there was a surge in violent crimes around Barcelona: in just the summer, there were almost as many violent deaths as there were for the whole previous year. While tourists are only occasionally targeted (and almost exclusively simple robberies), this should be not a going concern, many of these deaths are either drug-related or take place during drunken fights, so you are best advised to avoid such situations.\n\n\n=== Football ===\nLocal club FC Barcelona (also known as \"Bar\u00e7a\", a term used by locals to refer strictly to the club and not the city) is seen as a symbol of Catalan nationalism, and has a very heated and politically-charged rivalry with Real Madrid, which is seen as a symbol of the Spanish state and ruling establishment, and violent confrontations between the supporters of both clubs have been known to occur. Avoid wearing Real Madrid shirts while you're in Barcelona, especially on matchdays, as that could result in you being singled out for violence by local fans. On the other hand, wearing an Atl\u00e9tico Madrid (the other Madrid club) shirt might get you some stares and some harmless teasing, but certainly no violent reactions.\nFurthermore, the local Derbi barcelon\u00ed between FC Barcelona and Espanyol is also a politically-charged one, as FC Barcelona is traditionally supported by Catalan independence supporters, while Espanyol is traditionally supported by those who wish to remain part of Spain. If you hear Bar\u00e7a and Espanyol fans having an argument, be careful, as things can quickly escalate.\n\n\n=== ATMs ===\nBarcelona offers ATMs in many locations. Many provide a wide range of services (withdrawals, transfers, mobile credit recharges, ticketing, etc.), and most accept ATM/debit/credit cards of various banks. Choose an ATM in a secure or highly-public space (e.g., in a bank lobby or airport terminal) to avoid machines modified by criminals to skim/video your card data or where you might be robbed after use.  Ensure early in usage that the ATM supports a language you understand. For a full discussion of safe/effective charge/debit/ATM card usage and their cost trade-offs, see also Money. They will charge you a usage fee on top of anything your bank charges you which should be declared on the screen before you proceed (2,90\u20ac for a 500\u20ac withdrawal as of Oct. 2024 across different banks).\n\n\n=== Areas of caution ===\nBe very careful in the Barcelona Sants train station where thieves prey on new arrivals, even on the platforms. In general, try to stay away from suburban trains (cercanias in Spanish or rodalies in Catalan) late in the evening, as you may encounter young louts that disturb passengers, smoke, break windows and vandalize equipment. Don't rely too much on the railway security staff, as they prefer not to get involved, and by all means avoid messing with those troublemakers.\nWomen travelling alone should exercise caution while exploring the more isolated parts of Montju\u00efc. The city beaches, particularly the ones adjoining Barceloneta, have proven to be quite lucrative for bag snatchers. Anything that you would rather not lose is best left, locked, in your accommodation\nMen traveling alone should expect the prostitutes on Les Rambles, St. Antoni, and Raval in the early hours to be very aggressive and in league with pickpockets and robbers.\nAlso, people need to be careful when leaving the bars of the Olympic Port late as there are many pickpockets around.\nBe wary of wearing exposed jewelry such as gold chains and necklaces. People walking down a street may be attacked from behind by a snatch-and-run thief. Be especially careful of seedy looking men on bicycles, as snatch-and-run assaults can occur.\nIn the event of such a robbery, you will need to find the local police station to report the incident, especially if you are going to make a travel insurance claim. Don't expect any police action beyond the report, though, as these types of events are par for the course and arrests, even when made, almost never lead to prosecution due to a slow, antiquated, and overburdened legal system.\nParts of Barcelona are covered by closed circuit TV surveillance, but only the more popular spots.\n\n\n=== Anti-tourism movement ===\nMany Barcelona residents have the impression that there are too many tourists in Barcelona and that it has increased living costs, as landlords prefer to rent to tourists and not to locals to make more profit. Also, a lot of local shops have closed to make way for souvenir spots, so many locals feel they are being expelled from areas they have lived their whole life. In some areas, particularly the ones next to the beach where drunken tourists often stroll in swimming suits, there were anti-tourism demonstrations by locals, which had the backing of the Mayor of Barcelona. After nearly disappearing due to the Covid-19 pandemic, these riots have returned in 2024.\n\n\n=== Cars ===\nTourist drivers may attract special attention, such as Red light bag snatch or Flat tire scams\n\n\n=== Public transportation ===\nBesides being a particular pickpocket hot spot, there are plenty of fare evaders who will stick to you when crossing a fare barrier. Do not even attempt to block their way and let them pass, as many of them can be quite aggressive. Although stations are full of surveillance cameras, they are seldom used to either enforce fare payment or as a proof for filed assault charges, except in the most severe cases. Lack of staff in many stations and few ticket inspections effectively mean carte blanche for them. The fare evasion fine is just \u20ac50 if paid on spot, no matter how many times the culprit has previously been caught, and many fines remain unpaid because payment enforcement is legally cumbersome.\n\n\n=== Reporting crimes ===\nIf you need to report a crime (for example, to claim on travel insurance), be prepared for the reality that in the downtown police station, officers generally do not speak English, even though the theft report form is in English, Spanish, and Catalan. The police station most often used to report theft is the one underneath Pla\u00e7a Catalunya beside metro station, where they have some translators for common languages.\n\n\n== Cope ==\n\n\n=== Hospitals ===\nEU citizens can get free or reduced cost medical treatment on presentation of an EHIC card and passport.\n\n Hospital Clinic I Provincial De Barcelona, C/ Villarroel 170 (Metro Stn Hospital Clinic (Line 5)), \u260f +34 932 275 400. \n\n\n=== Consulates ===\n\n\n== Go next ==\nDay trips from Barcelona include:\n\nCanet de Mar - Is small enough to walk almost anywhere. See the historical centre, the churches and cathedral, and visit many architectural works of Llu\u00eds Dom\u00e8nech i Montaner. Canet is the smallest town in Catalonia with many historical and modernist buildings. It also has a lot of blue flag beaches, recognised at the European level for their quality.\nCol\u00f2nia G\u00fcell \u2014 is a tiny settlement famous for its modernist architecture. It is on the railway to Montserrat.\nCosta Brava - The coast North of Barcelona has rocky cliffs and a mix of pebble beaches and sandy beaches.\nFigueres- Home of the most impressive Salvador Dal\u00ed museum.\nGirona - A quiet town with an ancient Jewish section, narrow streets, imposing walls and plenty of cafes. See directions to the north airport above.\nMontseny - UNESCO Biosphere Reserve 40 km (25 mi) northeast of Barcelona. Go there by car or bus/train\nMontserrat  - Visit the monastery nestled high in the mountains to see the Black Madonna or hike to the peak to earn a fantastic view of the surroundings. 50 km (31 mi) from Barcelona.\nParc del Garraf - Large natural area southwest of Barcelona. Many hikes can be reached by train. Be sure to bring sun protection and plenty of water. (An eleven mile hike, with some decent elevation gain: Take train to Castelldefels station, head up to Castel de Castelldefels, follow trail about 5 miles to La Morella, where you can take in some great views. Trace your steps back half a mile, then continue southwest towards Playa Garraf. Playa Grarraf is right by the Garraf train station, allowing easy access back to Barcelona.)\nPyrenees - A mountain range around 150 km (93 mi) north from the city.\nSant Cugat del Valles - Has one of the most interesting Romanesque cloisters in Catalunya, with many interesting carvings. The town itself is full of expensive vilas.\nSitges - A traditional beachside destination for the locals. Full of fashion shops open on Sundays. Is a popular gay destination too.\nCastelldefels - Another typical beachside destination for the locals. It is very popular for its wide range of gastronomy.\nTarragona - Old Roman period capital of eastern Spain, and today small seaside city off the tourist trail compared to Barcelona.\nVisit the Nature parks in Barcelona province."

        "title": "Vancouver",
        "extract": "Vancouver occupies an enviable spot in the world.  Blessed with miles of coastline, lush vegetation and crowned by the North Shore Mountains, it's hard to be there and not stop at some point and be amazed by what you see.\nBut scratch beneath that setting and you find a cosmopolitan city of many faces. It is a mix of old and new, a stopping place for immigrants that have infused the city's neighbourhoods, festivals and food. On one hand, Greater Vancouver is the third largest metropolitan area in Canada, the second biggest destination for visitors to the country and the economic hub of British Columbia. A modern city of glass towers with a variety of festivals, cultures and attractions, it has also been host to world events like the 1986 World Exposition and the 2010 Winter Olympics. To others, it's Vansterdam, the laid-back socially progressive city with the laissez-faire attitude to marijuana. With its Asian heritage and relative proximity to China and Japan, some see it as the gateway to Asia; often called Hongcouver due to the large number of immigrants and political refugees from Hong Kong living in the area. And with all that nature minutes from your door, Vancouver is a haven for outdoor enthusiasts.  It's one of those rare places you could ski in the mountains, hit one of the many sandy beaches and play a round of golf all in the same day. Vancouver is one of the most culturally diverse and cosmopolitan cities in the world, with just under half its residents born outside Canada.\nAll of this makes it easy to be a local. Walk the Seawall. Spend a day in one of the parks. Indulge in food and treats from around the world at a neighbourhood restaurant. Or just grab a spot at the beach or on a patio and watch it all go by \u2013 Vancouver is, after all, one of the most beautiful spots in the world.\n\n\n== Districts ==\nVancouverites broadly split the City of Vancouver in three: the Westside, the Eastside (or East Van) and city centre. This split is simply geography: everything west of Ontario St is the Westside, everything east is East Vancouver and everything north of False Creek is the city centre. Each of these areas have their own attractions and neighbourhoods, so time permitting, explore as many as you can. This list covers only the City of Vancouver. For the rest of Greater Vancouver, see Lower Mainland.\n\n\n=== City Centre ===\n\n\n=== Outside the city centre ===\n\n\n== Understand ==\nWhile Vancouver is a comparatively young city, founded in 1867, its history begins long before. The Coast Salish indigenous peoples (First Nations) have lived in the area for at least 6,000 years. The present city's namesake Captain George Vancouver sailed through the First Narrows on 13 June 1792, naming Burrard Inlet after his friend Sir Harry Burrard. The first settlement on the downtown peninsula was Granville, on the spot of today's Gastown. In 1867, the year of Canada's confederation, a saloon was built on this site and gave birth to a small shantytown of bars and stores, adjacent to the original mill, on the south shore of what is now the city's harbour. A seemingly endless supply of high-quality lumber was logged and sold through the ports of Gastown and Moodyville, across the inlet.  Some of the trees were gigantic beams which were shipped to China to construct Beijing's Imperial Palace. One account maintains that the world's windjammer fleets could not have been built without the trees of Burrard Inlet.\nVancouver's first City Hall was little more than a hand-painted sign nailed to a wooden tent post. The arrival of the transcontinental railway, a few years later, spurred growth even more, and by 1892 the area had over 20,000 residents. 18 years later, this figure was over 100,000.\nFactor in constant growth every year since (many in the double digits), and Greater Vancouver today is Canada's largest metropolitan area west of Toronto by far, with more than 2,600,000 residents, more than half of British Columbia's population as a whole. It is also the fastest growing part of Canada. During the 1980s and 1990s, Vancouver received a large number of immigrants from Hong Kong fleeing the impending handover to China. Greater Vancouver is today one of the most ethnically diverse metropolitan areas in the world, home to the second largest Chinese population in North America after the San Francisco Bay Area, and with about half its population being born outside Canada. It is also home to a large and influential Sikh community, and one of the main centres of the Khalistan movement that advocates for the carving out of an independent Sikh nation from India.\nFor many, Vancouver truly \"arrived\" in 1986, when the city hosted the Expo 86 World's Fair. Media attention from around the world was consistently positive, though many saw the resulting gentrification of poorer areas as being harmful to Vancouver's lower-class citizens, as many residents of the Downtown Eastside were evicted from their homes. Vancouver also hosted the 2010 Winter Olympics, which was largely seen as another success, though it brought some similar criticisms.\nVancouver is perhaps best known for its scenic beauty, and the opportunities afforded by its natural environment. Vancouver is one of those rare places where you could theoretically ski in the mountains, windsurf in the ocean, and play a round of golf all in the same day. Surrounded by water on three sides, and crowned by the North Shore mountains, Vancouver is a great destination, and a great starting point for discovering the area's many outdoor activities.\nVancouver is a major sea port on the Pacific Ocean, and a base for many Alaska cruise ships in the summer.  It has the same name as another city in the region, Vancouver, Washington (USA).\nVancouver is believed to be the inspiration for the fictional setting of Adventure Bay, in the animated children's television series PAW Patrol.\nVancouver's residents enjoy a high standard of living, and the city is consistently ranked among the most livable on Earth.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nDepending on who you talk to, or perhaps, when, Vancouver's climate is either much maligned or envied.  Late fall and winter are typically damp with clouds smothering the sky like a wet grey blanket (there's a reason Vancouver is sometimes referred to as the \"Wet Coast\").  But there are benefits to all that rain: it's usually not snowing (unlike most of the rest of Canada) and it leads to a gorgeous display of colour with the start of spring in early March. And that's where Vancouver really shines \u2013 the spring and summer. Springs can still be wet, but it gets warmer and the shrubs, blossom trees and flowers put on a pretty show. Summer days are long and usually sunny with little humidity. Summer daylight lasts from 5:15AM to as late as 9:15PM in late June.\nSummer temperatures from mid-June to early-Sept are mostly comfortable. Temperatures peak in late July and early August with an average daytime highs around 23 \u00b0C (73 \u00b0F) and overnight lows around 15 \u00b0C (59 \u00b0F). Some particularly hot days can see temperatures climb upwards to 26 \u00b0C (79 \u00b0F) and not go below 17 \u00b0C (63 \u00b0F) at night. Daytime summer highs increase the further east you go, with eastern areas of the city having average daytime highs around 25.6 \u00b0C (78.1 \u00b0F), climbing around to or even exceeding 31 \u00b0C (88 \u00b0F) on exceptionally hot days. \nSpring and fall are cooler and wetter, so packing a mix of cool and warm weather clothing is recommended. If visiting Vancouver between November and March, be prepared for wet weather and cool temperatures. Daytime highs are typically around 5-8\u00b0C (40-50\u00b0F) while overnight lows will get close to 0\u00b0C (32\u00b0F) and sometimes colder. December and January are the coldest months, with the most rain and a chance of snow. While Vancouver's winters are not as harsh as those in other major Canadian cities, the city does get a few days of snow in the winter months every year. Sunrises in winter are after 8AM, with darkness setting in prior to 4:15PM in December.\n\n\n=== Visitor information ===\n1 Tourism Vancouver Visitor Centre, 200 Burrard St (Plaza level, Burrard & Cordova), \u260f +1 604-683-2000, fax: +1 604-682-6839. 8:30AM-6PM.

The Domestic and International Terminal is the main terminal that most travellers will use, while the South Terminal has prop, small jet, and seaplane service to local communities in British Columbia and Yukon.   \nYVR is the second busiest airport in Canada, with frequent flights from cities in British Columbia, the rest of Canada, other North American countries, Asia, and Europe. It is also the only Canadian airport to have direct flights to Australia and New Zealand because of its westerly location.\n\nTransLink's SkyTrain (Canada Line) provides direct service to downtown Vancouver in 25 minutes. The fare from YVR to Vancouver is $9.65 (July 2024), which includes the two-zone base fare of $4.65 plus a $5 surcharge (the \"YVR AddFare\") incurred only for departures from the airport. Bus N10 runs overnight to Vancouver when the Skytrain service is closed. Route C92 connects the South Terminal with Bridgeport station on the Canada Line during limited daytime hours. \nThe typical travel time from the airport to downtown by taxi is 20-30 minutes. Fares for a taxi ride from the airport to Vancouver or Richmond are fixed and vary depending on the zone of the destination. The zone map and fixed rates are posted at YVR Taxis. Metered fares apply for all trips going to the airport, and for trips from outside the zones. All taxis that serve the airport are required to accept credit cards.\n\n\n==== Seaplane ====\nThere are floatplane facilities about 300 metres south of YVR's South Terminal and in downtown Vancouver at:\n\n2 Vancouver Harbour Flight Centre (CXH  IATA), 1055 Canada Place (Downtown Vancouver), \u260f +1 604-647-7570.   \nThese floatplane facilities offer frequent flights to downtown Vancouver and/or YVR. Flight to downtonwn Vancouver from Comox (50 minutes, summer), Nanaimo harbour (20 minutes), Powell River (40 minutes), Tofino (1 hours, summer), Victoria's Inner Harbour (35 minutes), Whistler (45 minutes, summer) the scenic Southern Gulf Islands and other local destinations. Some float plane operators also offer spectacular tours of the central city and nearby attractions starting at about $80-100 per person. A great way to see a panoramic view of downtown. A quick search of Google will bring up websites for most of these float plane operators. See Vancouver International Airport for seaplane flights that land at that airport.\nSeaplane airlines operating to downtown Vancouver:\n\n Harbour Air, \u260f +1-604-274-1277, toll-free: +1-800-665-0212.

Around about 60 km (37 mi) east of Vancouver in Abbotsford is Vancouver's alternate airport. It handles mostly domestic and low-cost carrier flights and, with an arranged ride, you can be in and out of this airport in under 10 min (with no checked in baggage). The best way to reach Vancouver from Abbotsford Airport is by car: take the Trans-Canada Highway (Hwy 1) west. The drive will take 45\u201390 minutes, depending on traffic. There is no public transit link to this airport, but two intercity bus operators have stops at this airport and Vancouver's Pacific Central Station (see \"By bus\"). Car rentals are available at the airport.   \n5 Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA IATA), 17801 International Blvd, Seattle, WA (between Seattle and Tacoma). Flying in and out of Seattle, particularly for US destinations, and then using the bus, train, or car rental for travel to and from Vancouver can be a considerably less expensive option than buying a direct flight to the airport of Vancouver or Abbotsford. If required for your nationality, you will need a U.S. visa, and this could take some time to procure. For budget travellers, you may wish to consider checking flights to and from here. See \"By bus\" and \"By train\" for intercity travel options to Seattle. One bus operator provides direct access from the airport to Vancouver. Otherwise, travellers can take Link rail rapid transit between the airport and near Seattle's downtown, where multiple bus options and a train option to Vancouver are available.   \n6 Bellingham International Airport (BLI IATA), 4255 Mitchell Way, Bellingham, Washington (Bellingham). [1] About an hour from Vancouver (plus border time), and serves mainly as a launching point for budget-minded Canadian travellers vacationing in the U.S.: excellent service from Hawaii and Las Vegas, but few other useful connections.

Otherwise, travellers can a bus (Monday to Saturday) or taxi between the airport and the other bus option and a train option to Vancouver.   \n\n\n=== By car ===\nSee also: Lower Mainland#By car\nThe main highway into Vancouver from the east is Highway  1 (Trans-Canada Highway).  This road skirts the eastern edge of Vancouver, so if you want to get into the city, you will need to exit off it at Grandview Highway (exit 28A), 1st Avenue (exit 27) or Hastings Street (exit 26). Most major highways from interior British Columbia converge at Hope, 143 km (89 mi) east of Vancouver, then following the Trans-Canada Highway west into Vancouver.\nFrom the U.S./Canada border south of the city, Highway 99, which links up with U.S. Interstate 5, runs north to Vancouver.  The freeway ends after the Oak Street Bridge, turning into Oak Street heading north. Drivers with a downtown destination will need to get onto Granville Street (parallel to Oak St to the west), or Cambie Street (parallel to the east), in order to get on the Granville Street or Cambie Street bridges which cross False Creek into the downtown peninsula.\nIf you are coming from the North Shore or other points further north, the only way into Vancouver is by bridge. Your options are the Lions Gate Bridge (Hwy 99) which brings you into Stanley Park and Vancouver's West End or the Second Narrows Bridge/Ironworkers Memorial Bridge (Hwy 1) which brings you into the neighbourhoods of East Van.\n\n\n=== By bus ===\nMany bus services reach the Vancouver area, most of which terminate at Pacific Central Station (see \"By train\" below for the location and directions). A number of bus services also have additional pick-up and drop-off stops at hotels in downtown Vancouver, Richmond, Surrey, White Rock and in a number of places in the surrounding areas as well as from the airport. Not all bus lines serve the Pacific Central Station either. Buses cross the U.S./Canada border at an alternate crossing point (for trucks and buses) 5 mi/8 km east of the Peace Arch Park (BC Hwy 99/I-5) along BC Hwy 15/WA Hwy 543.

The standard adult fare is $3.20 for all bus trips across Metro Vancouver and SkyTrain travel within the City of Vancouver (Zone 1). It also covers all travel system-wide at off-peak times: weekends, holidays, and weekday evenings after 6:30PM. Travel out of Vancouver on the SkyTrain or SeaBus crosses fare zone boundaries and costs $4.65 to $6.35 on weekdays before 6:30PM.\nAfter paying fare, you can transfer or re-board an unlimited number of times at no extra charge for 90 minutes. Compass Card and Compass Ticket users have no restrictions on transferring between modes of transit, but bus riders paying cash fare can only transfer to other buses.\nUpon final tap-in within the 90-minute window, Compass Card and Compass Ticket users have an additional 120 minutes to tap out at their final destination. Tapping out after this time will result in another fare being charged.\n\nFares paid using Compass Card (see next section) are discounted and cost between $2.60 and $4.90 for an adult fare.\nConcession fares are available for youth (13-18) and seniors (65+), with ID. Children age 12 or younger are free.\n\n\n==== Paying for your fare: Compass ====\n\nCompass is the electronic fare system for buses, SkyTrain, SeaBus and the West Coast Express. Buses still accept cash when you board, but fare gates at SkyTrain and SeaBus station only accept Compass. There are two Compass choices:\n\nCompass Ticket \u2014 A white ticket that is good for one trip. The DayPass \u2013 unlimited travel on bus, SkyTrain and SeaBus across all zones for one day \u2013 can also be purchased as a Compass Ticket; and\nCompass Card \u2014 A reusable smart card that can store value, load passes and offers discounted fares. Blue cards are for adult fares, orange cards are for concession fares. See the infobox for more information.\nCompass Tickets and Adult Compass Cards can be purchased from the Compass Vending Machines in SkyTrain and SeaBus stations and some London Drugs locations. All types of cards and tickets may be purchased over the counter at some 7-Eleven, Safeway, London Drugs, Shoppers Drug Mart locations, and the TransLink Customer Service Centre at Waterfront station. TransLink's website has a handy map showing the locations of Compass retailers and Compass Vending Machines. The vending machines accept cash, Interac debit cards, and Visa or MasterCard credit card. American Express can only be used to buy a card or ticket from a retail location.\nThe purchase of a Compass Card requires a $6 deposit. The deposit is refundable if you return your Compass Card to or mail a Refund Request form to the Compass Customer Service Centre, but if your remaining cash balance is above $20, the only way to get back the balance is to have a cheque mailed out, so make sure to use up your balance before you do so.\nTap in with your Compass Card or Ticket at the start of every trip on any vehicle, and tap out every time you exit through a fare gate. Bus riders do not tap out. Doing this lets the system calculate the right fare.\nIf you're travelling in a group, Compass Tickets and Cards cannot be shared between group members. Each person will need their own ticket or card to tap in and out of the fare gates.\nMastercard and Visa credit cards can also be used at Compass readers/fare gates for an adult fare. When you tap-in, your card will be pre-authorized for a three zone fare. When you tap-out, the fare will be calculated according to the zones travelled. Mobile wallets (such as Apple Pay and Google Pay) also work, just make sure your phone will have enough battery so you can tap-out at the end of your journey. Debit cards still work at Compass vending machines, but not at Compass readers.\nFind out how to pay fares and where to buy passes and TransLink's refund policy.\n\n\n==== Passes and stored value ====\nIf you are going to make heavy use of the transit system, passes can be loaded onto a Compass Card.\n\nA DayPass is a money-saving option for travellers who will use public transit heavily for one day. For $11.50 (or $9.05 concession) (July 2024), it offers unlimited travel across Metro Vancouver on bus, SkyTrain and SeaBus until the end of the service day, late at night.\nMonthly passes can save you money if you will be using transit almost daily for a month. They cost between $107.30 and $193.80 (or $61.35 concession) depending on the number of zones.\n\n\n==== Buses ====\n\nThe bus service covers the widest area and travels along most major streets in the city. Many of the routes within the City of Vancouver are electric trolley buses, powered by overhead wires.  \nA limited stop express bus line called the RapidBus serves, not only Vancouver, but the entire lower mainland (Metro Vancouver) RapidBus gets a priority lane in traffic, There are 6 different RapidBus Routes. When boarding the RapidBus, It's all door-boarding, and passengers must either tap in with their Compass Card or Compass Ticket, buy a ticket with cash, (exact change required, coins only), or present a ticket to the driver. To buy a ticket with cash, passengers must enter through the front door. The 6 RapidBus Routes are:\n\nR1 King George Blvd (operates in Surrey)\nR2 Marine Drive (operates in North Vancouver and West Vancouver)\nR3 Lougheed Highway (operates in Coquitlam, Port Coquitlam, Pitt Meadows, Maple Ridge)\nR4 41st Ave (operates in Vancouver's UBC and South Vancouver areas)\nR5 Hastings Street (operates in Vancouver's central business district, Gastown-Chinatown and East Van, and in Burnaby)\nR6 Scott Road (operates in Surrey)\nSimilar to RapidBus, is the 99 B-Line, which is a limited stop express bus route that travels along Broadway Avenue (operates in Vancouver's UBC, Kitsilano, Mt Pleasant, and East Van). The portion of this route east of Arbutus St is to be replaced by an extension of the Millennium Line opening in 2027.   \nCash fare on any bus to anywhere at any time is a flat $3.20. Because of this, Compass Card users only tap in when boarding the bus, and never tap out when stepping off, unlike with all other modes of transit.\nEvery bus stop in Metro Vancouver has a unique five-digit bus stop number (the yellow number at the top of the bus stop sign). Send an SMS with that stop number to 33333 to get the next six scheduled bus arrival times. Standard text messaging rates apply. TransLink does not operate an app, but many third party apps (such as Google Maps) can be used to get transit times, additionally a mobile website is available. Many popular bus stops include a digital display with estimated bus arrival times. The stops for the RapidBus, have an electronic, real time, bus schedule.\n\n\n==== SkyTrain ====\nThe SkyTrain is a mostly elevated, fully automated rapid transit system connecting downtown Vancouver with some of its suburbs to the south and east. Trains depart frequently throughout the day, on tracks separated from other traffic at up to 80 km/h.\nThe Expo Line runs from Waterfront Station in downtown Vancouver through Burnaby and New Westminster to Columbia Station, where it splits with some trips going to King George Station in Surrey and the other track going to University/Production Way station in Burnaby.  An eastern extension to Langley is expected to open in 2029.\nThe Millennium Line runs east-west from VCC-Clark in East Van through northern Burnaby to Lougheed Station, and then continues on to Port Moody and Coquitlam via the Evergreen Extension.  A western extension along Broadway to Arbutus St is expected to open in 2027.\nThe Canada Line runs from Waterfront Station in downtown Vancouver south to Bridgeport Station, where it splits with some trips to Richmond's city centre and some trips to Vancouver International Airport's domestic and international terminals.\nKey SkyTrain stations include:\n\nCommercial-Broadway \u2013 accesses restaurants and shopping on Commercial Drive in East Vancouver and transfer point to the 99 B-Line bus to UBC.  Meeting point for the Expo Line and Millennium Line.\nBurrard and Granville \u2013 the most central stations in the central business district. You can also connect to the R5 Hastings Street RapidBus route at Burrard station.\nWaterfront \u2013 meeting point for Expo Line and Canada Line, the SeaBus, numerous commuter and rapid bus routes, and the commuter rail West Coast Express. It also accesses Gastown and is right next to the Canada Place Convention Centre/Cruise Ship Terminal facilities.\nThe fare on SkyTrain depends on how many zones you travel through and what time you're travelling. The City of Vancouver is Zone 1. Close-in suburbs like Burnaby, New Westminster, Richmond, and North Vancouver are Zone 2. Farther-out suburbs south of the Fraser River or east of Burnaby are Zone 3. At peak times, Compass Card users pay between $2.60 and $4.90, and riders paying cash fare pay $3.20 to $6.35 (all fares are standard adult fare). At off-peak times, passengers pay the one-zone.\nCompass Card users tap in and out each time they pass through the fare gates. If you forget to tap in or out, you will be charged the maximum fare. People choosing not to use Compass Cards can buy single-use Compass Tickets instead.\n\n\n==== SeaBus ====\nThe SeaBus is a passenger ferry that connects Waterfront Station downtown to Lonsdale Quay in North Vancouver. It generally runs every 15 minutes until the 9:16PM departure, after which it runs every 30 minutes until last sailing (M-Sa 1:22AM, Su 11:16PM).\nDuring peak times, two-zone fare is required. That is $3.85 for passengers with Compass Cards and $4.65 (July 2024) for those with Compass Tickets. At off-peak times, passengers pay one-zone fare.\n\n\n=== By ferry ===\nPrivate operators have scheduled ferry service to destinations around False Creek. A quick trip across on a cute little-boat-that-could ferry can be the most fun, traffic-free, and convenient way to get around between the following destinations (from west to east):\n\nMaritime Museum in Vanier Park on the south shore in Kitsilano (False Creek Ferries)\nAquatic Centre at Sunset Beach on the north shore in the West End (False Creek Ferries)\nHornby St on the north shore in the city centre (Aquabus)\nGranville Island and its famous Public Market on the south shore (Aquabus / False Creek Ferries at different docks)\nYaletown/Davie St. on the north shore (Aquabus / False Creek Ferries)\nStamp's Landing/Monk's and Spyglass Place on the south shore in the False Creek area (Aquabus / False Creek Ferries)\nPlaza of Nations and Edgewater Casino on the north shore in Yaletown (Aquabus / False Creek Ferries)\nScience World, the geodesic dome at the south-east end of False Creek (Aquabus / False Creek Ferries)\nService is offered by:\n\n False Creek Ferries, \u260f +1 604-684-7781. Little blue boats.   (updated Jun 2023)\n Aquabus, \u260f +1 604-689-5858. Little rainbow boats.   (updated Jun 2023)\nThe two ferries run slightly different routes, and their docks on Granville Island are on either side of the Public Market. As of Jan 2017, prices for adults are $3.25 for short routes, $5.50 for long routes, or $15 for a day pass. For seniors and children, the prices are $2, $3.75, and $11-13. Aquabus offers a 25-minute \"mini-cruise\" around False Creek for $8 per adult and $4 per child or senior.\n\n\n=== By car ===\nVancouver's road network is generally a grid system with a \"Street\" running north-south and an \"Avenue\" running east-west. Arterial roads follow the grid fairly well (although not perfectly), but side streets frequently disappear for blocks at a time and then reappear. Most of the \"Avenues\" are numbered and they always use East or West to designate whether it is on the east side or the west side of Ontario Street. Some of the major avenues use names rather than numbers (Broadway would be 9th Ave, King Edward Ave would be 25th Ave).\nDowntown Vancouver has its own grid system and doesn't follow the street/avenue format of the rest of the city. It is also surrounded by water on three sides, so most of the ways in and out require you to cross a bridge. This can cause traffic congestion, particularly at peak times (morning and evening commutes, sunny weekend afternoons, major sporting events), so factor that into any driving plans, or avoid if possible.\n\nOne of the best ways to avoid traffic congestion is to listen to traffic reports on AM730. This station reports only about traffic and can be quick to report any accidents and congestion, as well as B.C. ferry reports, bridge and tunnel updates, border wait times, and other information pertaining to getting around the city and its many suburbs. It also posts frequent weather updates and local news.\nA unique feature of Vancouver and the rest of British Columbia is intersections with flashing green traffic signals.  These do not indicate an advance left turn as it would in many other parts of North America.  Instead, a flashing green light indicates a traffic signal that can be activated only by a pedestrian or a cyclist on the side street, but not by a motor vehicle.  When the signal turns red, traffic stops as at any traffic signal.  Any side street traffic must obey the stop sign on the side street and must yield to any pedestrians crossing the side street, even if traffic is stopped on the main street.\n\n\n==== Parking ====\n\nParking downtown generally costs $1-2.50/hour or $12-20/day. Commercial areas will typically have meter parking on the street, with meters accepting Canadian and American change only (American coins accepted at par value). Residential streets may allow free parking, but some will require a permit.\nIf you do not have cash with you, most meters allow you to text the lot and stall number to PayByPhone, allowing payment through Visa or Mastercard. Each meter will specify if available.\nEasy Park lots (look for an orange circle with a big \"P\") rank as the most affordable of the parkades, but generally the cost of parking will not vary greatly among parkades within a certain area.  Most will accept payment by credit card, as well as coins.  Beware of scammers hanging around in some parkades, trying to sell parking tickets for less than their face value \u2014 typically, they have purchased the tickets with stolen credit cards. Also be careful parking overnight, as vehicle break-ins are not uncommon.\nCity meters and parking regulations are enforced regularly. Meter-related offenses will result in fines. Violations in private lots are generally unenforceable, but may result in your car being towed. If your vehicle is towed on a city street, you can recover it at the city impound lot at 425 Industrial Ave.\nSome new meters at private parking lots throughout the city no longer accept cash, make sure to also have a credit card with you. Most parking facilities also accept payment using the PayByPhone app.\n\n\n==== Car sharing ====\nVancouver is often referred to as the car share capital, with over 2,000 available vehicles. Car sharing which allow vehicle rentals by the hour and minute. With the departure of Car2Go and Zipcar, the only companies left in this space are Evo and Modo. If you are a BCAA member, you can get a free Evo membership through their website. To sign up for Modo, if your licence was issued from outside BC, you will need to put down a $750 damage deposit or provide a copy of your driving records from your home country (including a translation to English made by an approved translator if it is not already in English.)\n\n\n=== By taxi ===\n Black Top Cabs, \u260f +1 604-731-1111.

(updated Jul 2022)\n\n\n=== By bicycle ===\n\nVancouver is a very bicycle-friendly city. In addition to the extremely popular seawall bicycle routes along Stanley Park, False Creek and Kitsilano, there is a network of bicycle routes that connect the whole city, with many of the downtown bike lanes separated from traffic. The City of Vancouver provides a map of the bicycle routes that is available at most bike shops or online.  Also, all buses have bicycle racks on the front to help riders get to less accessible parts. North American visitors will find that drivers in Vancouver are more accustomed to sharing the road with cyclists than many places.\nThe city of Vancouver operates a bike share program called Mobi. A 24-hour pass costs $19 for an unlimited number of 30-minute trips, with each additional minute costing 25 cents. Monthly passes are available for $39 (30-minute trips). Trips on a monthly pass that take longer than the allowed time will be charged an extra 25 cents per minute. Bike stations are spread across downtown, the West End, Gastown, Yaletown and False Creek, Granville Island and Kitsilano. Bikes are unlocked via a user code and PIN that are provided after you complete registration on Mobi's website. It's highly recommended that visitors complete registration before their visit, as you cannot do it at bike share stations.\nLonger term bike rentals are available at a number of independent shops, where you can rent bicycles by the hour, day or week. Many places also rent tandem bikes. Shops can be found in the  central business district, the West End, Yaletown and near Granville Island. Alternatively, buy a used bicycle and either sell it on or donate it to someone in more need of it at the end of your stay.\n\n\n=== By scooter ===\nRenting a scooter is a good compromise between a bike and a car. Scooters are not allowed on the famous bike path, but it is possible to travel in the inner roads, park and walk at all the attractions.\nAverage cost is ~$80 for 24 hours + gas.\n\n Cycle BC, Location 1: (next to harbour air terminal) Location 2: 73 East 6th Ave, \u260f +1 604-709-5663. \nVanEcoRide Escooter & Ebike Rental 1020 Mainland St unit 26 +1 778-683-7711\n Vancouver Scooter Rental, 501-2050 Scotia St, \u260f +1 604-787-9177. \n\n\n== See ==\nWhile Vancouver is still a young city, it has a variety of attractions and points of interest for the visitor.\n\n\n=== Landmarks and historic buildings ===\nMany of the city's landmarks and historical buildings can be found in the central business district. Canada Place, with its distinctive sails, the nearby Olympic Cauldron, the intricate Art Deco styling of the Marine Building and the old luxury railway hotel of the Hotel Vancouver are in the central business district. Stanley Park (the city's most popular attraction), along with its neighbouring Coal Harbour walkway and the Vancouver Aquarium are in the West End.  Gastown, the original town site of Vancouver, has a number of restored buildings and its steam clock is a popular spot to visit. Modern architecture worth visiting also includes Shangri-La, the tallest building in the city, and the Sheraton Wall Centre, both located in central business district. Another popular city landmark, the bustling markets and shops of Granville Island, is just to the south of downtown in an area called South Granville.\n\n\n=== Museums and galleries ===\nIf you're looking to learn about the people of the Northwest Coast and some of its history, one good spot is the impressive Museum of Anthropology at the University of British Columbia, which houses several thousand objects from BC's First Nations. The museum is also home to significant collections of archaeological objects and ethnographic materials from other parts of the world.\nThe Vancouver Art Gallery in the central business district combines local with international through a variety of exhibitions and a permanent collection that focuses on renowned British Columbia artist, Emily Carr.\n\nThe Central Library location of the Vancouver Public Library, in the central business district at Homer and Robson Streets, is modelled after the Roman Colosseum, and houses the city's largest library.\nAnother sight in the  central business district is the small Contemporary Art Gallery on Nelson Street, which features modern art. Also nearby, on the east side of False Creek is the shiny geodesic dome of the Telus World of Science (commonly known as Science World), which has a number of exhibits, shows and galleries aimed at making science fun for kids.\nAnother great spot to check out is the BC Sports Hall of Fame and Museum at Gate A of BC Place Stadium in Yaletown. The BC Sports Hall of Fame and Museum preserves and honours BC's Sport heritage by recognizing extraordinary achievement in sport through using their collection and stories to inspire all people to pursue their dreams.\nThere are also some smaller sights in Kitsilano, including the Vancouver Maritime Museum, Museum of Vancouver, and H.R. Macmillan Space Centre.\n\n\n=== Parks ===\nThe city has a wealth of parks and gardens scattered throughout.  The most famous is Stanley Park at the tip of the West End. Its miles of trails for walking and cycling, beaches, magnificent views and the attractions (including totem poles) within the park gives it something for everyone.  The most popular trail is the Seawall, a paved trail that runs around the perimeter of Stanley Park and now joins with the seawalls in Coal Harbour and Kitsilano, 22 km in length. The Vancouver Aquarium is in Stanley Park. Other notable parks and gardens include VanDusen Botanical Garden in South Vancouver and Queen Elizabeth Park near South Main, the Nitobe Memorial Garden (commonly known as the Nitobe Japanese Garden) and UBC Botanical Garden at the University of British Columbia and the Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden in Chinatown.\nAdmission to Vancouver's various attractions can range from $10 to up to $30 per person. There are a variety of attractions passes available that help visitors save on retail admissions such as the See Vancouver Smartvisit Card.\n\n\n=== Nature ===\nFinally, a trip to Vancouver wouldn't be complete without a glimpse of the skyline and the Coast Mountains rising above the city (clouds permitting, of course!). Popular spots to view it include Stanley Park in the West End, Harbour Centre in the central business district, Spanish Banks and Jericho Beaches in Point Grey, and Lonsdale Quay in North Vancouver. Other interesting views can be seen from City Hall at 12th and Cambie in Mt Pleasant, Queen Elizabeth Park in Mt Pleasant, and East Van's CRAB Park.\n\n\n== Do ==\n\n\n=== Culture and festivals ===\nVancouver isn't all about the outdoors. It offers a variety of theatre, concerts and other cultural events.  There are symphony and opera venues in the central business district and much of the city's live theatre can be found in South Granville, particularly on Granville Island with its thriving arts scene.\nThe city's Chinese heritage comes alive during Chinese New Year.  Chinatown, in the east side of downtown, is awash in colour and has many festivities, including a parade.  June sees the annual Dragon Boat Festival on False Creek.\nThere is no shortage of festivals around the city, with many local ones particular to a neighbourhood.  The festival that draws the largest crowds is the Honda Celebration of Light, a three-night extravaganza of fireworks over English Bay in late July. Countries compete with 20-30 min displays choreographed to music.  The fireworks start at 10PM and are best viewed from Sunset Beach in the West End or Kits Beach/Vanier Park in Kitsilano. It is strongly recommended to take public transit and to get there a few hours early as the crowds are huge. Roads in the vicinity of English Bay are typically closed from 6PM onwards.\nEAT! Vancouver - The Everything Food + Cooking Festival takes place every year. The festival takes place in early November. Celebrity chefs, popular local restaurants, wineries, food & beverage manufacturers, cookbook authors, retailers, artisans, & many others from the culinary world come together for a 6-day event.\nOther notable festivals include the Vancouver International Film Festival that runs in Sept-Oct; the Fringe Festival that presents live theatre in a variety of styles and venues; Bard on the Beach Shakespeare Festival that runs May - September at Vanier Park in Kitsilano; and the three day Folk Fest on the beach in Kitsilano that features a large selection of current and upcoming folk, roots and world music acts. Another notable event is Vancouver's annual Vancouver Pride Parade, in early August, which attractsover 600,000 spectators.\n\n\n=== Laugh ===\nVancouver is also home to an enormous stand-up comedy scene. With 3 dedicated clubs, and more than two dozen venues hosting regular events, the Lower Mainland plays host to nearly 10,000 improv, stand-up, and open mic shows a year, such as by the Improv Centre on Granville Island. Catch touring comics, well-seasoned locals, or up and coming newbies at shows from theaters to pizza joints and experience some of the local, underground culture.\n\n\n=== Live music ===\nVancouver has lots and lots of live music venues ranging from BC Place (over 60,000 seats) to local bars, pubs and coffee shops.  There are also a plethora of festivals especially throughout the summer months.  The Vancouver International Jazz Festival runs for two weeks in late June and early July and attracts big name jazz and avant garde acts.\n\n\n=== Outdoor activities ===\nVancouverites love the outdoors and one of the most popular things to do is to walk, jog, bike or rollerblade the Seawall.  It starts at Canada Place downtown, wraps around Stanley Park and follows the shoreline of False Creek through Yaletown, Science World and Granville Island to Kits Beach in Kitsilano. The most popular sections are around Stanley Park and along the north shore of False Creek. Bike and rollerblade rentals are available from a few shops near the corner of Denman & West Georgia in the West End if you prefer wheeled transportation over walking.  If the weather's nice, go out to Granville Island, rent a speedboat and take a boat ride on the waters around Stanley Park and Coal Harbour. Golf courses are also abundant in the city, along with more cost-conscious pitch-and-putt courses.\nIf you'd rather lie in the sun than play in the sun, Vancouver has a number of beaches. While certainly not glamorous and lacking waves, there's sand, water and lots of people on sunny summer days. Kitsilano has a string of beaches, the most well known being Kitsilano Beach, Jericho and Spanish Banks.  Kits Beach is the most popular and has beach volleyball, Spanish Banks is a bit quieter and popular with skimboarders. There are a few beaches on the south and west sides of downtown, with English Bay Beach (near Denman & Beach in the West End) being the largest and most popular.  Finally, no discussion of Vancouver beaches would be complete without mention of Wreck Beach at the tip of Point Grey in UBC. As much rock as it is sand, it holds a place in the Vancouver identity and is the only city beach where you can bare it all. [2]\nFor many, Vancouver is synonymous with skiing and snowboarding.  While there are no ski hills within the city itself, there are three \"local\" hills (Cypress, Grouse Mountain and Seymour) across the harbour on the North Shore. And of course, Vancouver is the gateway to Whistler, the biggest and one of the most highly rated snow destinations in North America.\n\n\n=== Spectator sports ===\nWhen you tire of doing stuff outdoors, or prefer that someone else do the hard work, you can always grab a seat and take in the local sports teams.\n\n\n==== Hockey ====\nThe biggest draw in town is hockey (the variety played on ice, not a field) and the local professional team is the Vancouver Canucks. The team plays at Rogers Arena in Yaletown and the season lasts from October to April (and possibly longer when they make the play-offs). Tickets are pricey and the concessions are even worse, but it's a good game to watch live. The local junior hockey team, the Vancouver Giants, offer a cheaper but no less exciting experience, but play in the Langley Events Centre some distance from Vancouver.\n\n\n==== Football ====\nThe BC Lions, the city's Canadian Football League team (think American football with 12 players a side, three downs, a slightly larger field, and much larger end zones) plays during the summer and fall at BC Place in Yaletown.\n\n\n==== Soccer ====\nThe Vancouver Whitecaps FC, the third team to bear the \"Whitecaps\" name, began play in Major League Soccer in March 2011, becoming the second MLS team in Canada (they have since been joined by a third Canadian team). They have played at BC Place since September 2011, when that venue reopened after post-Olympics renovations. The Whitecaps initially planned to build a new stadium of their own near the waterfront, but local opposition led the Whitecaps to make BC Place their long-term home.\n\n\n==== Rugby ====\nBC Place also hosts the Canada Sevens, an annual event in the World Rugby Sevens Series (marketed as the HSBC SVNS), a worldwide series of tournaments for men's and women's national teams in rugby sevens, a variant of rugby union featuring 7 players per side instead of 15 (on the same full-size field) and halves of 7 minutes instead of 40. In the current schedule, the event is held on the last weekend of February as part of a North American swing that also includes an event in the Los Angeles suburb of Carson, California.\n\n\n==== Roller derby ====\nThe Terminal City Rollergirls are Vancouver's first female roller derby league and are members of the Women's Flat Track Derby Association. Created in 2006, the league now has four full teams (Faster Pussycats, Bad Reputations, Public Frenemy, and Riot Girls) as well as an All-Stars team made up of the best players in the league. The players are a diverse group of women, from nurses to construction workers, graphic designers, television producers, teachers, stay-at-home moms, PhD students and aspiring rock stars. The bouts are exciting and fun (there is usually an entertaining half-time show). If you're thinking about attending a bout and know nothing or very little about flat track roller derby, check out the Women\u2019s Flat Track Derby Association's (WFTDA) explanation. Bouts are generally held April to September and at various arenas around Metro Vancouver, although the PNE Forum in East Van has been a popular venue.\n\n\n==== Baseball ====\nVancouver has a single A baseball team, the Vancouver Canadians, who play out of Nat Bailey Stadium in the Mt Pleasant area.\n\n\n==== University sports ====\nThe two major universities in the Vancouver area both have comprehensive athletic programs, though not at the high profile of similar institutions south of the border:\n\n Simon Fraser Red Leafs. Represent Simon Fraser University in Burnaby. The Red Leafs sponsor teams in seven men's sports and nine women's sports. Notably, SFU is the only Canadian school that's a member of the U.S. NCAA, though they are in Division II, competing with mostly smaller, regional U.S. institutions. SFU no longer plays football, either American or Canadian; it had played under American rules in the NCAA, but logistical complications led the school to drop the sport after the 2022 season.  (updated Jun 2024)\n UBC Thunderbirds. Represent the University of British Columbia in the University Endowment Lands at the west edge of the Point Grey peninsula. The Thunderbirds field teams in 15 men's sports and 14 women's sports. Unlike SFU, UBC is a member of Canada's governing body for university sport, U Sports.  (updated Aug 2022)\n\n\n=== Tours ===\nIf you want to orient yourself in the city, there are a variety of tours \u2013 bus, walking, hop-on, hop-off \u2013 based out of the City Centre that will regale you with Vancouver lore while taking you to many of the main attractions.\n\n\n== Learn ==\nVancouver is a city with a rich assortment of educational institutions offering programs on nearly every possible occupation or avocation. There are two main universities (Simon Fraser University, and  University of British Columbia). Polytechnic institutions offer degrees in addition to certificates and diplomas.  Vancouver is also a popular destination to learn English: expect to see many learners from Asian countries, such as South Korea, and from Brazil.\nPlaces of study within the city of Vancouver include:\n\nThe University of British Columbia (UBC), is ranked as one of the world's 30 best universities and is the largest university in western Canada. It is publicly funded and has the highest student enrollment of any university in British Columbia.  More than 50,000 full-time and part-time students in numerous disciplines are enrolled at the main campus in the UBC-Point Grey area. UBC also has a downtown campus in Vancouver at Robson Square in the city centre area. This location is geared more towards adult learning, business people and foreign students. Course calendars are readily available at Robson Square or on UBC's website.\nLangara College is publicly funded and in South Vancouver. It offers a number of programs in the arts, humanities, business and technology, as well as continuing education and ESL classes.\nThe Emily Carr Institute of Art + Design is publicly funded and in East Van.

With over 30 000 full-time students, SFU is consistently ranked as the best Comprehensive University in Canada by Macleans.  Its main campus on the top of a mountain in Burnaby with spectacular views.  SFU also has the largest post-secondary presence in the city centre area, with the Beedie School of Business, the Morris J Wosk Centre for Dialogue, SFU Harbour Centre and SFU Woodwards, not to mention a satellite campus in Surrey.\nThe British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT), is publicly funded and a technical college based in Burnaby.  It has a satellite campus in downtown Vancouver.\nThe Justice Institute of British Columbia (JIBC) is publicly funded and is a post-secondary institution focusing on public safety vocations. Its main campus is in New Westminster.\nKwantlen Polytechnic University (KPU) is publicly funded with campuses in Richmond, Surrey, and Langley.  It offers over 120 programs, including career, vocational trades and technology certificates, diplomas, and degrees across numerous disciplines.\nDouglas College is a publicly funded and offers degrees with campuses in New Westminster and Coquitlam.\nTrinity Western University (TWU) is a private Christian university with undergraduate and graduate studies programs.  Its main campus is in Langley and it has a smaller campus in Richmond.\n\n\n== Work ==\nTraditionally, much of Vancouver's industry has centred around its port facilities and the forestry and mining sectors. Although these industries are still important to the economy, Vancouver's largest employers are now the various hospitals and educational institutions in the area and companies with head offices in Vancouver such as Telus Corp and the Jim Pattison Group. Vancouver however has expanded as a centre for software development and biotechnology, while streets provide a backdrop for an active film industry. Many jobs exist in the varied small and medium sized businesses that operate in the region.  As with many cities, jobs are posted on-line or in the newspaper, but it helps if you have some contacts within the industry that can point you to the jobs that are open but not posted.\nAs with any tourist centre, there are a number of service jobs available.  The attractions, restaurants and hotels downtown frequently need staff.  Other areas to consider are Granville Island and the North Shore with its ski areas and Grouse Mountain.\n\n\n== Buy ==\nThis is only a sample of things you can look for in Vancouver. Visit the separate district pages for other info.\nTip - There are two local taxes that are charged on the vast majority of goods, the 7% PST (Provincial Sales Tax) and the 5% GST (Goods and Services Tax).\nThe PST does not apply to restaurants, motor fuel, food (including non-alcoholic drinks), vitamins, books, newspaper, magazines, bicycles, and children's clothing.\n\n Robson Street. In the City Centre is home to many touristy shops. The neighbouring Alberni intersection is also home to a variety of high-end shops such as Louis Vuitton and Herm\u00e8s.  (updated Aug 2022)\n Pacific Centre. Located in the City Centre. Has more than 150 shops, restaurants and services if you want to walk in an underground shopping centre. The shopping centre begins at its north end at Robson Street, and stretches all the way to Pender Street. There are many floors in the mall depending on where you are, and notable merchants include Holt Renfrew, Harry Rosen, Gap, H&M and Apple Store; the mall is connected to the Hudson's Bay (at Georgia and Granville streets), and Vancouver Centre (a small mall mainly consisting of a lotto centre, London Drugs, and a food court underneath Scotiabank).  (updated Mar 2023)\n\n Gastown. Is the oldest neighbourhood in Vancouver but is being reborn as a fashion and modern urban design district. Historic buildings house hip restaurants, galleries, and interior design and high-fashion shops. This area also is notable having the most tourist souvenir shops in the region.  (updated Aug 2022)\n Yaletown. Is also popular for its non-mainstream fashion boutiques and high-end salons. A few Popular Yaletown Shopping Streets are: Mainland St., Hamilton St., and Pacific Blvd. (updated Oct 2023)\n Granville Island. Is an interesting place to go if you fancy the arts. The area boasts a public market, an art school (Emily Carr University of Art + Design), shops, a world music instrument store, restaurants, theatres, galleries, a hotel, boat docks and more.  (updated Aug 2022)\n Kerrisdale (Area centred on 41st, between Maple St and Blenheim St,). Located in South Vancouver. Consisting of roughly a hundred or so boutique-like shops, restaurants, and stores (chain or otherwise) in an affluent neighbourhood.  (updated Aug 2022)\n Commercial Drive. Especially the stretch between 3rd Avenue and Venables St. in East Van, is great for people-watching, produce (Santa Barbara Market), cheese (La Grotta del Formaggio), sausage (JN&Z Deli), etc.  (updated Aug 2022)\n Main Street (South Main). Located in Mt Pleasant. South of Broadway stretching to around 30th Avenue, has a vibrant and expanding collection of independent restaurants, caf\u00e9s, high-end niche clothing stores and small boutiques.  (updated Oct 2023)\n East Hastings. Located in East Van between Renfrew and Clark offers some of the best hidden delights in the city. There are many eclectic produce stores (Donald's Market).  (updated Oct 2023)\n Chinatown (Around Main and Pender, and westwards down Pender from Main.). An old historic landmark where the first Chinese immigrants to the area settled, though these days it is a shadow of its former self, having become largely deserted and full of homeless people. Other newer and more vibrant Chinatowns have sprung up around 41st Ave. and Victoria Drive, also in Richmond and Surrey, and are much better places to go to if authentic Chinese culture and food is what you are after.  (updated Aug 2022)\n Punjabi Market. Around Main, between 41st and 49th Ave. Good, cheap Punjabi food along with some Punjabi fashion; street signs are correspondingly in Punjabi.  (updated Oct 2023)\nThere are some unique shopping areas in Kitsilano and East Van. In Kits you can visit the first store of Vancouver-born and based athletic retailer, Lululemon Athletica, sporting popular yoga-inspired apparel. Gore-tex jackets are ubiquitous in Vancouver and the best place to buy them is at Mountain Equipment Co-op, Taiga Works or one of the other outdoorsy stores clustered together on the east-west main drag called Broadway (equivalent to 9th Avenue, running between 8th and 10th) between Cambie St. and Main St., just east of the Kitsilano area.\n\n\n== Eat ==\nWhere to begin? There is something for everyone in this cosmopolitan city, and the variety of cuisines and price points have been described as a foodie's delight. In particular, you will find many different kinds of Asian food available. If you fancy sushi many places offer \"all you can eat\" lunches for $12, which offers food of a wildly varying quality. In general, the city is up there with some of the best cities in North America when it comes to food. If you can do without alcohol, you can usually have a pretty reasonable meal for under $12, and at one of the more expensive restaurants in the city, $70 will get you a four course feast with exquisite service.\nThe highest density of restaurants is in Kitsilano or the West End. The central business area has many of the high end restaurants either along Robson Street or associated with the many hotels in the downtown area. East Van tends to have many authentic ethnic restaurants.\nVancouver is also famous for its Cantonese restaurants, in particular because it received a huge number of top chefs from Hong Kong fleeing the impending handover back to China in the 1980s and 1990s. Because of this large diaspora from Hong Kong, the price and quality of dim sum, siu mei and other Cantonese dishes here is among the best in the world, with many even claiming that Vancouver's Cantonese food is better than that of Hong Kong and Guangdong. However, Vancouver's Chinatown is now a shadow of its former self, with most of the remaining restaurants being tourist traps serving mediocre food. These days, the best Chinese food can be found in the suburb of Richmond, with a majority of its inhabitants being ethnically Chinese. Restaurants are all over the place on No. 3 Rd, Westminster Hwy, Alexandra Rd, and on the many side streets just east of Richmond Centre.\nVancouver has  become a lot more vegetarian and vegan friendly. For exclusively veg-fare, there is Indigo Age downtown, the Naam in Kits, the Acorn on Main St, Meet in Gastown, Kokomo in Chinatown, Roots + Fruits in Strathcona, Eternal Abundance on the Drive, and Chomp in Hastings-Sunrise- to name only a few.\nMany Vancouver restaurants recommend you have a reservation, the majority of them use OpenTable, or other similar software; however, some require you to phone. Check on the restaurants website or Yelp page before you go to be sure you will be seated in a timely manner.\nFor budget travellers, pick up a Georgia Straight (a free local paper available all over the place), and clip two-for-one coupons from the food section.\nEvery January, the city holds a food festival with over 270 local restaurants, which offer prix-fixe menus. The program, Dine Out Vancouver, runs over 17 days and includes the cities new eateries, neighbourhood favourites and award-winners. In 2017, to will be held from January 20 to February 5.\nAlthough the vast majority of stores around Vancouver accept credit cards, small family-owned Chinese businesses and restaurants, more often than not, accept only cash. Very few businesses in the city accept cheques.\nVancouver is also known for its gourmet ice cream shops, with some of the more notable chains including Rain or Shine Ice Cream, Earnest Ice Cream and Bella Gelateria. While in Vancouver, make sure you try the \"London fog\" flavour, which is earl grey tea with fresh milk.\nFood safety inspection reports are available online from the local health authority, Vancouver Coastal Health.\n\n\n== Drink ==\nMost of the nightclubs are in the central business district, especially along the Granville Street strip, south of Robson and along Water Street in Gastown. There are a number of good local pubs in the various quieter neighbourhoods of the city, such as along Main Street or Broadway. Closing times for most of these pub-like establishments begin at 1AM; nightclubs close between 2AM-3AM with a very small number operating after-hours. Nightclubs with music, a DJ and a dance floor usually charge an entrance fee. Be aware that many nightclubs often have long lineup queues on weekends, which are usually self-imposed regardless of whether or not the establishment is near capacity to attract business. Flexibility and willingness to go early is key should nightlife become part of your travel plans.\nLiquor stores by 11PM at the latest close, while many are closed by 9PM, and there will exist no other legal options apart from drinking at an establishment beyond this time.\n\n\n=== Coffee ===\nOn Robson and Thurlow, there used to be two Starbucks kitty-corner to one another, hardly surprising as Starbucks is the most dominant of the three coffee shop chains found in Vancouver and it is claimed there are more Starbucks per capita in Vancouver than anywhere else. The other chains, Caffe Artigiano and Blenz, are found throughout downtown. JJ Bean is favoured among the locals and it's a great place to spend a few minutes to a few hours nursing a coffee and one of their ginormous muffins; there are ten locations scattered throughout the city. Bean Around the World is a popular coffee house chain with ten locations. Waves Coffee is popular with students for its 24-hour operations, and free Wi-Fi internet. For independent chains try Mario's on Dunsmuir and Howe; they have a unique feel and a slower pace than other coffee shops. Make sure not to miss Trees' cheesecakes and its roasted on-site organic coffees.\nVancouver has seen a rise of new independent coffee shops in the past three years, most of which focus on single-origin beans and a simpler approach to delicious coffee devoid of syrups and flavourings. Examples include: Matchstick, Kafka's, Revolver, 49th Parallel.\n\n\n=== Tea ===\nA distinctive local drink in Vancouver is called the London fog, which is similar to a latte except that it uses a shot of earl grey tea instead of espresso coffee. It is available at virtually every coffee shop in Vancouver.\nBubble tea (or boba tea) is also a popular drink among the Vancouver youth.  There are countless tea houses throughout Vancouver, the most notable being Dragon Ball Tea House on West King Edward Ave and Oak St.\n\n\n=== Beer ===\nVancouver offers a number of destinations for beer drinkers.  The largest is the Granville Island Brewery on Granville Island (tours are available). Other microbreweries are housed in brewpubs, popular ones include the Yaletown Brewing Company in Yaletown and Steamworks at the entrance to Gastown.  The Alibi Room, near Gastown, specializes in beers by Northwestern microbreweries as does the Cascade Room in South Main. Portland, also in South Main, is another craft beer venue that specializes in beers by Oregon based microbreweries.\nEast Vancouver, near Commercial Drive and E Hastings St, has become a hot spot for smaller craft breweries. This area is popular with locals who like to hit up a few different breweries, sampling beer and eating snacks like pepperoni sticks. There are over 10 breweries within walking distance of each other. Check out Storm Brewing, Callister Brewing, and Parallel 49 Brewing Company to name a few. $6 for a flight of 6 samples is standard, though some breweries such as Storm Brewing provide samples by donation.\nOlympic Village, in False Creek, is another craft brewing hot spot, with multiple craft breweries within walking distance of eachother, including 33 Acres Brewing Company, Brassneck Brewery, Main Street Brewing Co, and more. All of these breweries are easily accessible by public transit.\nIf you fancy a short journey outside of Vancouver proper, Port Moody is easily accessible by Skytrain and has another great strip of small local breweries. North Vancouver, a 15 min SeaBus ride from downtown, offers another cluster of breweries, cider mill, distillery, winery, and braggotery along their newly developing \"Brewery District\".\n\n\n== Sleep ==\nIn general, accommodations in Vancouver are on the expensive side. Most upscale hotel rooms begin at $200-250/night, although you can find reasonably priced ones in the $100-180 range quite often. Most motel rooms cost somewhere between $80-150/night. If you are lucky to find hostel accommodation, the cheapest of these will cost around $30/night, more reasonably between $35-50.\nThe City Centre is centrally for attractions and has the bulk of Vancouver's accommodation, including most of the high-end hotels and backpackers hostels. If you don't mind getting away from the chain hotels, there are a number of smaller boutique hotels outside of the central business district but still close to the action that are cheaper than the four and five star options downtown. Backpacker hostels are another cheap option with beds starting at $25 if you don't mind sharing a room.\nStaying outside the City Centre area may give you a wider choice of affordable accommodations. There are a few budget hotels/motels along Kingsway in East Van and Broadway in South Granville. A number of B&Bs and AirBnB rentals are also scattered throughout the city in each district.  If you want/need to stay close to the airport, Richmond has a number of hotels with varying degrees of luxury and price.\nFinally, if you don't mind driving or commuting in to see Vancouver, the suburbs also have some cheaper options. North Vancouver, Burnaby and New Westminster all have easy access to Vancouver via the public transit system. The closest Provincial Parks with campgrounds are near Maple Ridge (Golden Ears Provincial Park), Chilliwack, and Squamish.\nCamping in city parks is prohibited under Vancouver\u2019s by-laws. Travellers may hear a claim that it is legal to camp overnight in city parks in Victoria and Abbotsford; (due to court cases that permit the homeless to do); but whether this would also apply to Vancouver or extend to travellers looking to free camp is unknown. That said, a small number of mostly homeless people do camp in city parks and it seems the bylaw is not always enforced. If you decide to do this, avoid the Downtown Eastside (Gastown-Chinatown and points directly east), don\u2019t be disruptive, don\u2019t light fires and be aware of the risks of free camping/sleeping rough.\n\n\n== Connect ==\nIn an emergency, dial 9-1-1 from any phone, even mobile phones with no service. If you're subscribed to Rogers for mobile service, or you're roaming on their network, they support 1-1-2 as well as 9-1-1. All other carriers only support 9-1-1.\nThe telephone area codes 604, 778, and 236 overlap Vancouver and the surrounding area. This means the Lower Mainland requires ten-digit dialing, so you must dial the area code when making a local call. Calls out of the region (east of Langley, or north of Squamish, including to Whistler) require a 1 before the area code.\nAt payphones, local calls cost a flat 50 cents each. Be aware that many public phones have been removed, especially in the suburbs, due to the rise of cell phones. Downtown payphones are often broken, but the payphones at the downtown SkyTrain stations are almost always in service. Payphones can be used to call 911 free of charge.\nFree Wi-Fi is available at most hotels, caf\u00e9s, and restaurants, as well as practically everywhere downtown. The city operates over 500 free Wi-Fi hotspots throughout the city. A full list of the city operated wireless hotspots can be found here. Some Translink buses, skytrains, seabuses, as well as some stations and terminals also provide free Wi-Fi for transit passengers. Internet caf\u00e9s are not as popular as they once were, but several remain in Vancouver, charging hourly with all-day passes available.\n\n\n=== By mail ===\n2 Vancouver Main Post Office (Canada Post), 495 W Georgia St (W George St & Richards St). (retail counter) M-F 9AM-6PM. Postcodes for the greater Vancouver area typically range from V5J through V6Z. There are also other postcodes in the surrounding cities making up the greater Vancouver metropolitan area ranging from  V4A to V5J and from V7A to V7Y. Neighbourhood post office branches are within and operated by London Drugs, Shoppers Drug Mart, 7 Eleven and other retail stores contracted by Canada Post. They are marked with the red \"Canada Post\" signage and logo. (updated Nov 2022)\n\n\n== Stay safe ==\nVancouver is a great place to visit if you use common sense like keeping an eye on your possessions, knowing where you are going and avoiding alleys and unfamiliar areas at night should keep you out of trouble.  Unless involved in illegal activities (such as the drug trade), it is highly unlikely you will fall victim to any sort of violent crime. If you need emergency help, dial 911.\nLike any major metropolitan city, Vancouver has areas that should be travelled with caution.  The most notable is the Downtown Eastside (specifically Hastings Street between Abbott and Gore). This neighbourhood is infamous for homelessness, drug-use, and prostitution. As a result of these conditions, violence is quite a common problem. If you do accidentally stroll into the Downtown Eastside it is not difficult to find your way out, but if you get lost or feel uncomfortable the best thing to do is approach a police officer. Tourists exploring Gastown and Chinatown can easily wander into the Downtown Eastside unwittingly. Chinatown turns into a ghost town in the evening, and is mainly filled with homeless people, so you should avoid the area at night.\nIt's also wise to exercise caution in the Granville Mall area (Granville St between Smithe St and Hastings St) in the central business district on Friday and Saturday nights.  As Vancouver\u2019s bar and nightclub district, the sheer volume of people combined with alcohol consumption make disorderly conduct and rowdy behaviour fairly common. But this shouldn't act as a deterrent - if you're not looking for trouble, you probably won't find it, and there is a strong police presence. The streets at night in the Granville Mall area are usually (and quite literally) clogged with people at night time.  Such an enormous mix of people and alcohol can be a dangerous mix if you are not cautious.\nSome parts of the city have high rates of property crime. Theft from vehicles is especially problematic and parked cars with foreign or out-of-province plates are frequently targeted. The best thing is to not leave any money and valuables in plain view. Many of the locals use steering wheel locks to prevent vehicle theft.\nWhile using public transit, if you feel unsafe, approach a Transit police officer (usually at SkyTrain stations). For non-emergency requests, you can call \u260f +1-604-515-8300.\nPanhandling is common in some parts of downtown, but is unlikely to pose a problem. Don't be rude, as there may be negative consequences.\n\n\n=== Drugs ===\nCannabis can be purchased from private dispensaries or the government-run BC Cannabis stores, which also offer online sales. It's legal for adults over 19 to consume and possess up to 30 grams of cannabis. It is not permitted to smoke or vape cannabis anywhere tobacco use is prohibited.\nThere are serious penalties for driving under the influence of THC, which include fines and vehicle seizure. Also, while Washington State has legalized recreational cannabis at the state level it remains illegal to bring any cannabis products over the border in either direction. Do not buy cannabis in Canada and attempt to take it into Washington State, or vice versa, not even at out of the way crossings like Point Roberts.\nThe province of British Columbia is the first jurisdiction in the world to decriminalize possession of hard drugs. Possession of up to 2.5 grams of cocaine (crack and powder), methamphetamine, MDMA, and opioids (including heroin, fentanyl and morphine) is no longer a criminal offence. In some areas such as\nDowntown Eastside, the government provides safe injection sites where you can safely dispose off needles after injecting yourself. The exemption is scheduled to last until Jan 31, 2026. \nDriving while under the influence of drugs is a crime. Anyone caught selling drugs or trafficking them will still face criminal penalties. Possessing hard drugs at airports and many other locations remains illegal.\n\n\n== Cope ==\n\n\n=== Publications ===\n Vancouver Sun. Vancouver's biggest daily newspaper.

Another option is Public Mobile, which operates mostly online only, but SIMs can be purchased at London Drugs and generally costs less than other providers. Many wireless carriers offer out of country travel plans; inquire with your carrier regarding pricing before your trip.\n\n\n=== Religious services ===\nAnglican (Episcopal):  Christ Church Cathedral, 690 Burrard St, \u260f +1 604-682-3848.

St. Paul's Hospital has an emergency ward operating 24/7 serving people of all ages, but is smaller and therefore less equipped to handle many patients. Every winter, St. Paul's decorates the front of the Hospital with lights to encourage charitable donations.   (updated Jan 2023)\n6 Mount Saint Joseph Hospital, 3080 Prince Edward St, \u260f +1 604-874-1141. The only hospital on the city's East Side.

Some of the most popular are listed below. All of these places are accessible by public transit, or if you have a car, within an hour's drive.\n\nNorth Vancouver - Take in the views from Grouse Mountain (The Peak of Vancouver), go for a walk on a suspension bridge or enjoy one of the many outdoor recreation opportunities -- hiking, mountain biking, skiing/snowboarding, kayaking -- on offer. The most popular summer activity in the area is hiking the 'Grouse Grind', a 2.9-km, 853-m elevation gain hike up the side of Grouse mountain.\nWest Vancouver - A municipality north of the Lion's gate bridge, en route to Whistler. Home to many beaches, coves, parks and expensive real estate, where breathtaking views of Vancouver can be scoped by driving its higher altitudes.\nBurnaby - Shop till you drop at Metropolis at Metrotown, the largest shopping mall in British Columbia, or relax at one of the large regional parks. Also home to Simon Fraser University's main campus (notable for its brutalist architecture), on top of Burnaby mountain.\nPort Coquitlam, Coquitlam and Port Moody (the Tri City area) - Half hour drive down Hastings street to the Barnet Highway will bring you to Port Moody, locally known as the City of the Arts.\nRichmond - City with a large Asian influence with many options for Chinese, Japanese and Korean dining and shopping, one of the largest Buddhist temples in North America and the historic seaside Steveston towards the south offers a quieter, small-town type atmosphere.\nSurrey/White Rock - A 45 minute drive away from Vancouver, famous for its moderate climate and sandy beaches.  Surrey is also the place to go for South Asian shopping and watching Bollywood movies.\nFort Langley - Village with unique shops, restaurants and the site of one of the first forts built in British Columbia.\nNew Westminster - Small city on the banks of the Fraser River that was once the capital of British Columbia.\nDelta - Made up of three communities separated by farmland; North Delta, Ladner, and Tsawwassen. Ladner has a quaint village-like atmosphere which has attracted several movies to be shot there and is the home of the George C. Reifel Migratory Bird Sanctuary. Tsawwassen has Boundary Bay Regional Park with its walking trails and bird watching opportunities.\n\n\n=== Day trips ===\nBowen Island is a popular day trip or weekend excursion offering kayaking, hiking, shops, restaurants, and more. This authentic community is in Howe Sound just off Vancouver, and is accessed by ferry from Horseshoe Bay in West Vancouver.\nFor those who enjoy outdoor activities, a trek up the Sea to Sky corridor is essential. Squamish has branded itself the \"Outdoor Recreation Capital of Canada\" and with an incredible amount of quality rock climbing, mountain biking, white water rafting, hiking, kayaking, horseback riding, fishing, golf, walking trails and more, it certainly deserves the title. Squamish is about half way between Vancouver and Whistler. Whistler (1.5-hour drive from Vancouver) is expensive but well-known because of the 2010 Winter Olympics. In the winter, enjoy some of the best skiing in North America, and in the summer try some authentic mountain biking.\nAnother good spot for outdoor activities is Mount Baker across the border in Washington. Driving time is about three hours, but border line-ups can add anywhere from a few minutes to several hours onto your trip.\nThe nearby Fraser Valley has a number of parks and lakes that are nice for fishing, hiking or relaxing.  A popular lake beach destination is in Harrison Hot Springs.\nA geopolitical oddity: Point Roberts, a village that's part of the United States but can only be reached by land through Delta, BC.\n\n\n=== Further afield ===\nVancouver Island is a good spot to move on to from Vancouver. Victoria, British Columbia's capital, is a relaxing place. Tofino is a pretty spot on the island's west coast, good for whale and storm watching and has some of Canada's best surf (if you can brave the cold water). The island is reached by ferry, seaplane and bus.\nThe Southern Gulf Islands are also a short ferry ride or float plane flight away. The Southern Gulf Islands are known for their artist communities, wineries, fromageries and farms. These islands also boast incredible opportunities for boating, kayaking, hiking, camping and wildlife viewing in the Gulf Islands National Park Reserve.\nThe Okanagan is a four to five hour drive east, with a large number of wineries, water activities in the summer and skiing in the winter.\nThe scenery of Banff, Banff National Park and the Rocky Mountains is a long day's drive (8-9 hours) east.\nTo the south, in the United States, Seattle is a two and a half hour drive and Portland is a five hour drive (excluding any border line-up)."

        "title": "Nairobi",
        "extract": "Nairobi is a city of 4.4 million (2019) on the Nairobi River. It is the political, financial and media capital of Kenya, and a transit point that most travellers to Kenya will pass through. Nairobi is the largest and fastest growing city in Kenya, and one of the largest cities in Africa. It is worth taking a few days to experience this bustling metropolis.\n\n\n== Understand ==\n\n\n=== History ===\nThe word Nairobi is derived from a water hole known in Maasai as Enkare Nyorobi, which means \"cool waters\". Nairobi, which had been a swamp area, was founded in 1899 as a railway camp for the Uganda Railway. By 1905, the city had become the capital of Kenya (then the British East Africa Protectorate), supplanting Mombasa and Machakos, the previous capitals. With the spread of plagues in the early 1900s, the town was burnt down and had to be rebuilt. Having a railway helped it to grow rapidly, becoming the second largest city in Kenya behind Mombasa. Nairobi also grew due to administration and tourism businesses (mostly big game hunting).\nThe British presence led to the creation of big hotels primarily for the British hunters. After independence, some descendants of the British settlers remained in Nairobi and obtained Kenyan citizenship, and today form Kenya's white community. Nairobi has an East Indian community, who are the descendants of the labourers who built the railway and the merchants who set up shop during colonial times. After independence, Nairobi airport became the principal entrance point to Kenya and it still is today, although it has lost some of its importance to Mombasa.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nNairobi has a subtropical highland climate. At 1,795 metres above sea level, evenings may be cool, especially in the June/July season, when the temperature can drop to 9 \u00b0C.\nThe sunniest and warmest part of the year is from December to March, when temperatures average in the mid-twenties Celsius during the day. The mean maximum temperature for this period is 24 \u00b0C.\n\n\n=== Local information ===\nNairobi City Government website\n\n\n== Get in ==\nFor general information about visas and vaccinations, etc., see the Kenya article.\n\n\n=== By plane ===\n1 JKIA Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (NBO  IATA) (is 15 km (9.3 mi) south-east from the centre of the city). Nairobi\u2019s main airport, and one of Africa's largest hubs. Terminal 1A section is linked to Terminal 1B and 1C by walkways both airside and landside. Terminal 1A has a small food court upstairs airside, and there is a Nairobi Java House between the two terminals airside. Terminal 1B is completed since renovations in 2022 and it serves departures. Terminal 1C has very little except for 10 small shops all selling the same souvenirs. Terminal 1A has a two small shops with a better selection of duty-free and souvenirs. There are Ecobank & Cooperative bank & I&M no withdrawal fee ATMs at the airport or at the cargo terminal.   (updated Dec 2022)\n2 Wilson Airport (WIL  IATA). 11 km (7 mi) south from the city's centre, handles some domestic flights and general aviation.   \n\n\n==== Airlines ====\nKenya Airways (KQ) is the national airline of Kenya, and used to be one of the largest and most reputable airlines in Africa, providing extensive connections from international cities including London, Amsterdam, Paris, Dubai, Mumbai, Johannesburg, Antananarivo, Accra, New York JFK (a direct 15-hr flight), and a host of other countries around the world. Due to mismanagement and corruption, the airline has losses of US$120 million in 2019 and US$330 million in 2020.\nOther major commercial airlines to serve NBO include: Air Arabia, Air Mauritius, Air France, Lufthansa, British Airways, Brussels Airlines, China southern airlines, Egypt Air, Emirates, Ethiopian Airlines, Etihad Airways, Kenya Airways, KLM Royal Dutch, Oman Air, Qatar Airways, Saudi Arabian Airlines, RwandAir, Swiss International Airlines and Turkish Airlines.\n\n\n==== Transfers ====\nIf taking a taxi from JKIA, use a reputable taxi. Many are waiting outside to give you conveyance, and the cost should be very near Ksh 2,000 to the city centre; Westlands or places more west or north will be more. There is an official KAA taxi desk just after you exit the customs area, where you can buy a fixed-price voucher, and they will escort you to a taxi. When taking a taxi to your accommodation, do not be inveigled into taking their recommendation for accommodation. Uber or Bolt costs from Ksh 900 from airport to the centre.\nAirport Bus: To the city centre, Airport Bus #34 for Ksh 100 (as of 2023). You get the bus by walking on the road from the international airport terminal to the cargo terminal, or from in front of the Ambassador Hotel on Moi Avenue in the city centre. 6:00-20:00. The bus trip can take 2 hours in bad traffic, and may be inconvenient if you have big luggage.\nThere is no official taxi desk at Wilson, and each airline operates out of its own terminal. It may be difficult to arrange a reputable taxi on arrival, but there are plenty at the kerb.\n\n\n=== By train ===\nNairobi has become much more accessible by rail. Kenya Railways has opened the SGR railway in 2017 linking Nairobi and Mombasa, reducing travel time between the two cities to 5/6 hours. There are both express and slower intercity services, the latter stopping on more intermediate stations. Tickets cost Ksh 1000 for 2nd class and Ksh 3,000 for 1st. The difference between the first and 2nd class is just the size of seats. As the train is very popular it is recommended to buy tickets a few days beforehand. Trains operating on the SGR line call at Nairobi Terminus, which is almost 10 km southeast of city centre. A connecting commuter train to the central station is available. there are now 3x trains a day from Nairobi to Mombasa 1x is a night train.\nAs of June 2023 there is 2x weekly train service from Nairobi from Nanyuki via Nyeri. The train departs Nairobi old central railway station at 09:30 every Tuesday and Friday and takes six hours. The fare is Ksh 200 in 3rd class and Ksh 1000 in 1st class. there is also 1x weekly train from Nairobi to Kisumu every Friday which cost ksh 600/2000 and takes 12 hours.\n\n3 Nairobi Terminus (10 km southwest of city centre).   (updated Nov 2020)\n4 Nairobi central railway station. Central railway station and hub for Nairobi commuter trains services.   (updated Nov 2020)\n\n\n=== By bus ===\nNairobi is the centre of Kenya\u2019s (mostly reliable) bus system. There are many bus companies operating to and from the country\u2019s different cities.\n\nMombasa Use the SGR railway, it take less than half the time of the bus and costs 50% less.\nArusha in Tanzania 5\u00bd hr by Modern Coast. Arusha Shuttle.\nKisumu, Eldoret, Kitale, Kericho by Easy coach.\nKampala 12 hr by Modern coast, Dreamline or Mash Poa.\n\n\n=== By matatu ===\nMatatus (11- to 18-seater minibuses) and shuttles (6-seater cars) are convenient, inexpensive (and often the only) modes of public transport for connecting Nairobi with towns and tourist destinations in the Rift Valley and Central Highlands such as Naivasha, Nyeri, Nanyuki, Isiolo, and Thika. Matatus can be obtained from the River Road area. Extreme caution should be exercised in this area because petty theft is a major concern; avoid showing valuables such as mobile phones, even while in the matatu (see safety section below). The best method of connecting to a matatu is to arrange for a taxi to drop you off and pick you up directly at the location of the matatu that you are boarding or alighting from. If you're boarding a matatu from Nairobi, tell the taxi driver your destination and they will drop you off at the correct location. If you are being picked up, then tell the taxi driver the location you're coming from as well as the matatu company that you are using (your ticket should have the operator's name). It is best to arrange for a taxi from the hotel you're staying at. The price is dependent on the distance of travel.\n\nfrom/to Naivasha (Ksh 300) 1\u00bd hr\nfrom/to Nanyuki (Ksh 700) 11 seat. 3 hr\nPrestige Shuttle, Dubois Road, has 10-seat vans going from Nairobi to and from Nakuru and Kisumu. Ksh 600/1200.\nNorth Rift Shuttle behind the Afya Centre has 10-seat vans going from Nairobi to and from Eldoret. from Ksh 900.\nImpala shuttle Parkside hotel 25 monrovia street, next to jeevanjee gardens impala shuttles\n\n\n=== By boat ===\nEntry into Nairobi by boat is not possible (Nairobi River is not navigable), however one could certainly arrive in Kenya by boat via Mombasa or Lamu, proceeding by road, air or rail to Nairobi. Immigration should be processed at the port facility.\n\n\n== Get around ==\n\nBe careful getting around Nairobi. Traffic is very bad like any other major city, but if you use common sense and a local or guide you should be able to get where you want.\n\n\n=== By hired car ===\n\nHiring a car is convenient as it allows you the freedom to explore Nairobi at your own pace. Most rental companies in Nairobi offer self-drive and chauffeured options respectively. You will find that a large fleet of cars available for hire are Japanese: Toyota, Nissan or Mitsubishi. You can hire both automatic and manual transmission. All rental cars are right-hand drive. Hiring a vehicle with a driver or chauffeur is advisable due to the generally lower standards of driving, average to poor road conditions and the overall cost effectiveness of not having to pay a deposit on hiring a vehicle which is the case with a self drive vehicle.\nCar rental prices vary but as of April 2015 the going rates were as follows:\n\nSaloon car, e.g. Toyota Axio NZE, Toyota Fielder, Nissan Wingroad: (4 seater, under 1800cc, FWD) Ksh 4,000 per day.\n4X4 compact car, e.g. Toyota RAV4, Nissan Xtrail, Suzuki Vitara: (4 seater, 4X4 2500cc. AWD) Ksh 8,000 per day.\nLarge 4X4, e.g. Toyota Prado, Mitsubishi Pajero: (4X4 luxury, Jeep 3500cc, AWD): Ksh 16,000 per day.\n7 seater minivans, e.g. Toyota Voxy or Alphard: (7 seater, 2500cc, FWD): Ksh 10,000 per day.\nSafari vans, e.g. customised Toyota Hiace with a pop out roof: (8 Seater, 2500cc, 4WD): Ksh 10,000 per day\nSafari Jeep, e.g. customised Toyota Land Cruiser J70 jeep with a pop-out roof: (8 seater, 3500cc, 4WD): Ksh 14,000 per day.\nThe car rental rates are often determined by the number of days and estimated mileage per day. Some car hire companies will give you a rate that is 50% cheaper but either give you a contract with a clause limiting you to visit the specific locations, an old car or require a hefty deposit. The rates are cheaper if you are hiring the car for a week, a month or are looking for a lease. Most car rental rates include unlimited mileage, PSV comprehensive insurance, theft and damage waivers.\nThe driver and fuel are charged separately with some companies requiring that you hire a driver if you are taking a large 4X4/4WD (e.g. a Toyota Prado, Land Cruiser j70, Range Rover, Land Cruiser VX, Land Rover discovery). The cost of a driver is Ksh 2500 per day inclusive of meals and accommodation (April 2015).\nAlthough a good number of local car hire companies are reliable, you should either take photos of the car before the hire, or carefully note the dents or scratches on the car and agree. In addition, carefully read the rental contract to check for rules on insurance liabilities in case of accident or theft of the vehicle.\nHere are some reliable car hire companies in Kenya:\n\nKenya Finest Tours & Safaris offers reliable transport services especially for landcruiser 4x4 and Nissan Safari Vans.\nNairobi Car Hire offer good services for 4x4 and other categories of cars.\nCentral Car Hire  are a reliable, trustworthy and helpful rental company based in Nairobi. Two-wheel drive and four-wheel drive vehicles are available and are well maintained.\nNairobi Car Hire Services provided by Hire N' Drive Kenya Limited who are very flexible with their rental terms and reliable. They accept credit card payment online with a very credible refund processing system. They also have a wide fleet of cars available at all major airports in Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu, Nakuru and Eldoret.\nElite Car Rental Kenya although their offices are located in Kikuyu Town, they are a reliable car rental company and have been in operation since the mid-1990s.\nAvis Rental the local representative of the global business. Services are dependable with a variety of self drive vehicle options.\nShoor Kenya - Car Hire which offer safari and saloon vehicle hire including drivers at highly reasonable pricing.\nHertz Car Hire are also represented in Kenya and offer pick up and drop off at the international airport in Nairobi.\nFor ease of navigation around town and to the outskirts, it is advisable to use the Google Map. The navigation guide can be combined with other useful apps such as to help you get a better experience. For ease of search and navigation to secure parking lots, you can use Pata Parking, a smartphone app which is downloadable from Google Play Store. The app enables drivers to search and pre-book for parking, with details of location, charges per hour, features of the preferred parking lot, and the number of reservable parking spaces.\n\n Explorer Kenya Safaris, Garden Estate Road. Victory House. 3rd Floor. Apartment 1, \u260f +254 722218260, info@explorerkenya.com. Offering safari 4x4 Land Cruisers and safari vans for use in Nairobi and on safari (updated Feb 2020)\n\n\n=== By taxi ===\nTaxis are neither very cheap nor prevalent. Prices should always be negotiated before the trip, and paid afterwards (only cash is accepted, often with limited change available). This can be tricky as it requires you to be knowledgeable on the market rate price of the ride you wish to take. Typically, taxis can be found parked around hotels, malls, and tourist areas. The taxis tend to be marked with a yellow line on each side. Your best bet is to ask a local or enquire at your hotel.\nThe taxi services Uber, Bolt (formerly Taxify), Little, Mondo Ride, and MaraMoja have become the hired car provider of choice among Nairobi's large expatriate population due to its convenience, cost competitiveness, and higher quality of service when compared to other taxi providers.\nIf you want a pre-arranged taxi with consistent pricing, you can try Davina Cabs. They have cab service in Mombasa, Nairobi, Kisumu and have an office in Eldoret.\n\n\n=== By bus (matatu) ===\nMatatus (public minibuses/commuter buses) are generally used for travelling between downtown Nairobi and the suburbs. Matatus vary in size, between the van sized 14-seat matatus and the larger 50-seat buses. While generally safe, matatus are involved in a high number of accidents every year. Matatus are often overcrowded with more people than seatbelts and therefore can be dangerous if involved in accidents. Because there are no licensing requirements, matatus are often poorly driven, with drivers passing on curbs, speeding, or passing in oncoming lanes while cars are oncoming. On each bus is a conductor who will hang out of the matatu and call out a price (usually Ksh 50-100 as of 2020) and location the matatu is driving. The government banned the 14-seat matatus inside Nairobi to reduce traffic and accidents in town. The best choice is probably the City Hoppa bus service and the revived Kenya Bus Service. Beware of traffic jams on the major highways, not only in the rush hours.\n\n\n=== By train ===\nThere is a commuter rail service from the Central Nairobi Railway Station going to Syokimau Railway Station. Syokimau Railway station is where you take trains going to Mombasa.\nTrain departures from the downtown Nairobi railway station going to Syokimau are at 6:35, 8AM, 9:35, noon, 17:30 and 18:20. From Syokimau the train departures are 6:20, 7:15, 8:50, 14:30 and 20:20. The trip takes 30 minutes. A one-way ticket costs Ksh 50-100 (as of 2023).\nThere are four rail commuter lines in Nairobi:\n1.Nairobi main station from Kahawa which departs Nairobi at 8AM, and from Kahawa back to Nairobi at 9AM.\n2.Nairobi main station from Embakasi Village Station. It departs Nairobi station at 7:20, 9:30, 11:20, 13:30, 18:00 and 18:30 from Embakasi village station back to Nairobi station departs at 7:00, 8:00, 10:15, 12:10, 14:20 and 19:15.\n3.Nairobi main station to Kikuyu station.\n4.Nairobi main station to Syokimau station.\n\n\n=== By foot ===\n\nWalking around Nairobi is fairly easy since the city is small and places are easy to get to. However, there are some areas within the city where tourists should not go, and walking around at night should be minimised.  Thugs are rampant in many areas.  The city centre may be considered safe by some to venture on foot, but it can't be considered a pleasant experience.  Expect to be approached by beggars, touts, etc.\n\n\n=== By cycle ===\nCycling is quite uncommon in the city and most roads are not at all suited for safe cycling. With that said, there are a few protected cycle lanes within the central district and the government are keen to expand them into a small network.\n\n\n=== By road ===\nCar hire from the airport is possible, and fairly painless with prices in line with other African countries. Travelling during the day reduces your chances of getting car-jacked as most car-jackings occur after dark, but even so, carjacking can still happen at any time of day, even with a strong police presence. However, watch out for undisciplined drivers, as they take little regard for safety.\n\n\n== See ==\nNairobi is known as the safari capital of Africa, however the city has still managed to keep up with modernization. Unlike other cities, Nairobi is surrounded by 113 km\u00b2 (70 mi\u00b2) of plains, cliffs and forest that makes up the city\u2019s Nairobi National Park. The city is filled with many things to do during the day and the night. Tourists can have their pick from numerous safaris (wildlife, cultural, sport, adventure, scenic and specialist), ecotourism tours, restaurants, culture, shopping and entertainment. While in Nairobi, tourists can also engage in numerous sports from golf, rugby, athletics, polo, horse-racing, cricket and football (soccer).\n\n1 Kenyatta International Conference Centre (KICC) (Central District). The best place to get that far ranging view over the sprawling, congested metropolis that is Nairobi. You can go up to the saucer-shaped top of the conference centre's round viewing tower and depending on smog and fog, you might be able to see as far as the slums and the national park. Ksh 400, Ksh 200 reduced.   \n2 US Embassy Bombings Memorial Site (Central District). In 1998 a truck bomb blast rocked downtown Nairobi. The US Embassy building had been the target of a terrorist attack, reducing it to rubble and killing 213 people, mostly bystanders, and leaving more than 4,000 injured. On the same day, the US embassy in Dar es Salaam was also subject to a similar attack which killed 11 people and injured 85. 21 people were charged, including Osama Bin Laden. The former embassy site today contains a memorial park, with a monument engraved with the names of every victim. Ksh 30.  (updated Jun 2024)\n3 Westlands by night. Visit the bustling and hip Westlands district, which has turned into the new nightlife centre of Nairobi. Many restaurants and bars line the busy Woodvale Grove and Mpaka Road. A visit to 'Tree house' club is a must if you are looking for a spacious one and crowd outnumbered with expats, rather than the otherwise congested natives dominated ones. Traffic can become hectic, well into the early hours. Security is generally tight and the action spills out from packed clubs into the street. \n4 UN Office at Nairobi (UN Complex Gigiri), United Nations Ave, \u260f +254 20 762 2034, un.tours@un.org. Sitting between the Karura Forest and the US Embassy, it houses international organisations such as the UN Environmental Programme, UN-HABITAT and is the basis of all UN operations in Africa. Africa's first completely carbon- and water-neutral building was opened here in 2011.

At first glance the falls are magnificent; however, the river is strongly polluted by industrial waste and a foul chemical smell and reams of rubbish strewn across all the rocks really ruin the experience. At Thika are the Thika and Chania Falls close to the Blue Post Hotel. That's interesting too for a stop to or from the 14 falls.

They put a plastic bottle filled with water on the asphalt, which apparently rolls uphill. If you ask them if they gave the bottle a nudge, they empty the contents onto the street.

For important things to consider when booking see Kenya#Safaris.\n\n\n== Buy ==\n\n\n=== Money ===\nThis may also be a good place to repeat the warning about safety. Pickpockets are rampant in Nairobi and have been known to keep an eye on people getting cash from a machine. It is best to carry cash in a hidden pouch rather than a wallet. Men should not carry their wallets in their back pockets, and women should not carry their purses to the side or behind them, particularly in busy locations.\n\nCredit cards: Many stores will accept international credit cards. all big supermarket chains accept credit cards without a surcharge.\nATM: There are networked banking machines in major shopping areas of Nairobi and in the Nairobi airport.

Cash is dispensed in units of Ksh 1,000. Many smaller businesses will not have much change, so before going shopping for curios be sure to have a good selection of smaller notes.\nForex bureaus are found in many parts of the city where tourists are common. They will exchange cash of different currencies, and may also accept a personal cheque for Kenyan cash. They will want a photocopy of your passport before they exchange money. Rates are not bad, but will be worse than a banking machine will offer. Many exchange bureaus and hotels will not accept or exchange American currency printed before 2000. When the exchange bureaus do accept pre-2000 notes, they typically offer substantially lower exchange rates than for currency printed after 2000. Exchange rates are also typically lower for small denomination currency than for US$100 and $50 bills.\nCashless payment: Another essential phone tool is M-Pesa. It is a mobile phone-based platform used for most money transactions in Kenya. M-Pesa agents are available all over Kenya. You can use the platform instead of carrying cash around for safety purposes.\n\n\n=== Shopping ===\nFor local curios and souvenirs, the most easily accessible and tourist-friendly is the Maasai Market, held on Fridays at the Village Market, an upmarket, open concept shopping centre near the United Nations and American Embassy complexes.

Beware of snatch and grab, con artists, or groups of people following you. Scams are elaborate and can involve up to 10 or more people working together. The best advice for a tourist is to stay in the city centre, know where you are at all times, and pretend you know where you're going (even if you don't). If you find yourself in an unfamiliar area your best bet is to find a taxi (although you will probably pay dearly if the driver suspects a panicked westerner!) Don't carry large quantities of money or passports on the street, and assume that anyone trying to engage you is up to no good or trying to sell you something. If you stay smart and play safe, without going around much after dark, Nairobi can be a safe place to stay. Most locals are honest people who will happily help you if you approach them. The areas where you have to take special care are: Globe Roundabout, Archives, Ambassadeur, Muthurwa Market, around Nation Centre, Landies Road, Nyamakima, Kirinyaga Road, and Uhuru.\nKenyans are proud people and there is not a lot of begging like you find in some other countries. Some opportunistic people will hang around shopping centres and beg, but they will generally accept a simple 'sorry' and leave you alone if you do not give. Many of these 'beggars' are middle-class kids or adults who have realised they can profit from exploiting white guilt, and should not be encouraged. If you are ever lucky enough to visit a slum as a local (not on some perverse tourist safari) you will discover the poorest of the poor do not even beg.\nOutside of tourist and expat communities, young children will become excited at the sight of a white person and may come running towards you to try to shake your hand while yelling out 'mzungu' (white person) or 'how are you?'. Older kids are more reserved, and you should be wary of kids who are older than 9 or 10 who are trying to distract or get close to you.\nSlums should be avoided by tourists as you will attract a lot of attention which can quickly turn into a dangerous situation.\nApart from the inner city centre, Nairobi dies out at night. Streets are mostly empty. Do not walk alone after nightfall. Always use taxis. The areas north and east of River Road should be avoided, especially if you're not a local!\nBiashara Street is a safe shopping street due to the presence of 10-15 Maasai guards. A place to avoid as a tourist is the City Market; you could end up paying a much higher price than on Biashara Street.\nIf you are in a matatu and moving slowly through traffic, particularly after dark, you should keep your window closed if your valuables are in reach to prevent people snatching them from the outside (there are thieves who walk through traffic looking for such opportunities). Mobile phones and wallets should be securely kept and not displayed prominently during calls or cash transactions in the River Road area, particularly after dark.\nEastleigh (known as 'little Mogadishu') is an area near the city centre that is decaying due to years of neglect by the government (including the police). It is predominantly populated by Somalian migrants and refugees, and most Kenyans will not go there for fear of their safety. Tourists would be wise to avoid it day and night.\nThere have been several grenade attacks in the city for which Al-Shabaab have claimed responsibility. These are likely to be ongoing while the Kenyan army has a presence in Somalia. They are random and often fatal, and one should be wary and report any suspicious behaviour. Associated with the terrorist threat, you can expect to pass through security checkpoints with armed guards at most attractions, shopping malls and even on the streets.  You can expect (at times) to have to have your bags searched, and car checked.\n\n\n== Stay healthy ==\nIt is recommended that before tourists come to Nairobi, that they should be vaccinated well in advance (6 weeks) of their trip. The most common recommended vaccines for people traveling to Africa are Tetanus, Diphtheria, Polio, Typhoid, Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, Yellow Fever, Rabies and Meningitis.\n\n\n=== Food and beverages ===\nBe careful with the food that you eat outside the more upscale establishments. Before eating, make sure that the food is freshly and thoroughly cooked and served hot. Also avoid seafood, except at upmarket restaurants and hotels, and make sure that your fruits and vegetables have been properly washed in clean water. The safest fruits to eat are bananas and papayas.\nDo not drink tap water or brush your teeth with it. Only use bottled or canned drinks (especially popular brands). Also, do not use ice as it may also be contaminated water, and remember that alcohol does not sterilize a drink. The general rule of thumb is, the more high end an establishment is, the greater the safety of the food and drink within.\n\n\n=== Insects ===\nIn Africa you are going to be exposed to yellow fever, dengue fever, other viral diseases, sleeping sickness, filariasis and malaria, although none of these diseases is a concern in Nairobi. When insects are biting you should cover up and wear long-sleeved shirts and trousers, socks and pyjamas especially when night falls. It is best to use an insect repellent that contains DEET on your exposed skin and clothing. As for mosquito nets, it is best to use a permethrin-impregnated net along with an insecticide such a pyrethrum coils or an electric mosquito killer during the night. And remember to spray your hotel room every evening.\n\n\n=== Heat and sun ===\nMake sure to drink plenty of fluids (not coffee, alcohol or strong tea) to avoid dehydration. To know if you well hydrated, you body would always produce plenty of clear urine. The average temperature is around 25\u00b0C (maximum might reach 30\u00b0C) throughout the year. People coming from Asian countries like India will not have much problem with the weather \u2014 in fact it will seem pleasant year-round. For people who are from cold countries, it can take three weeks to become accustomed to the heat. Try to avoid plenty of physical exertion and to stay in the shade and keep cool as much as possible. Increase the amount of salt intake in your food and water. Also, apply a lot of high-factor sunscreen, avoid direct sunlight, and try to wear a hat and shady clothing.\n\n\n== Connect ==\nThere are very many internet caf\u00e9s around Nairobi, but connection speeds and computers are not always super fast, but still you will manage to open your email, probably even use a webcam or watch YouTube. Prices are usually at ranges from Ksh 0.5/minute to Ksh 1/minute, usually with a minimum fee of Ksh 5-20. The more expensive internet caf\u00e9s are rarely better and the best ones charge Ksh 1/minute with discounts for using the internet for longer. Most of the good caf\u00e9s are found in Norwich Union which has quite a number just opposite Hilton Hotel next to Nandos while the expensive ones are found in malls in Westlands. Although it may be more appropriate for tourists to use the ones in Westlands since they are usually less crowded and are more exclusive but not necessarily faster or better in terms of equipment.\nFree wireless internet is available at Java House restaurants and Doorman's coffee shops in the city and malls. Some bars like Havana in Westlands also offer free wifi. The internet cafe in Sarit Centre also has wireless internet available at a good speed and a reasonable price.\nMobile phones are ubiquitous in Kenya with fairly good coverage from all providers Safaricom, Airtel and Telkom that extends to most populated parts of the country. Safaricom has the best national coverage especially if you are using 4G data. The phone system is GSM 900 and 3G-4G 2100 (Asian and European standard) on Safaricom, Airtel and Telkom Phones and SIM cards are available at many locations throughout Nairobi and the country including at the airport.  Phone prices are very competitive and priced for average income Kenyans.  A basic phone may be obtained new from an independent dealer for ~Ksh 2000. A vast majority of people use pre-paid phones with scratch-card top-ups available at a huge number of merchants across the country. Phones are sold \"unlocked\" by outlets for use on any network. Safaricom though does sell a number of phones locked to its network. Much business is conducted via mobile phone, so possession of one for even a relatively short stay in the country can be beneficial.  Rates are extremely affordable with in-country calls at around Ksh 3 per minute.  Overseas calls cost around Ksh 5 per minute to the United States (~USD$0.06/minute) and Ksh 3 per minute to India on the Airtel network.\n3G data service is available in most coverage areas on Safaricom and is of a fairly high standard. The other networks have 3G in major population areas and EDGE/GPRS everywhere else. If you have a smart phone you should buy a data pack (200mb, 500mb or 1.5gb) or your credit will go down very fast.\nAirtel and Telekom have lower prices for calls and data.\n\n\n== Cope ==\nSmoking is against the law out on the streets in the city centre (the downtown grid area with numerous skyscrapers).  There are certain smoking zones, and outside of the city centre it becomes much easier to find locations where it is acceptable.  However, a general rule would be to not smoke along the side of any roads or streets with pedestrians and/or vehicles.  Be observant and take your cues from other smokers - if there are no smokers or cigarette butts on the ground, it is likely a non-smoking location.\n\n\n=== Embassies, Consulates and High Commissions ===\n  Australia, Riverside Dr (400 m off Chiromo Rd), \u260f +254 20 4277100, fax: +254 20 4277139. \n  China, Woodlands Rd, \u260f +254 20 2726851, fax: +254 20 2726402, chinaemb_ken@mfa.gov.cn. \n  Cyprus, International House 6th Floor, Mama Ngina St, \u260f +254 20 2220881, fax: +254 20 312202, cyprusnairobi@gmail.com.

        "title": "London",
        "extract": "Noisy, vibrant and truly multicultural,  London is a megalopolis of people, ideas and frenetic energy. The capital and largest city of the United Kingdom sits on the River Thames in South-East England. Greater London has a population of a little over 9 million. Considered one of the world's leading \"global cities\", London remains an international capital of culture, music, education, fashion, politics, finance and trade. For the visitor, there is a seemingly endless choice of historical sites, shopping, museums, food, art galleries, nightlife, and activities.\n\n\n== Districts ==\nThe name \"London\" used to refer only to the once-walled \"Square Mile\" of the original Roman and later medieval city; this is now confusingly called the \"City of London\" or just \"The City\". Today, London has taken on a much larger meaning to include all of the vast central parts of the modern metropolis, with the city having absorbed numerous surrounding towns and villages over the centuries, including large portions of the surrounding \"home counties\", one of which - Middlesex - being completely consumed by the growing metropolis. The term Greater London embraces Central London together with all the outlying suburbs that lie in one continuous urban sprawl within the lower Thames Valley. Though densely populated, London retains large swathes of green parkland and open space, even within the city centre.\nGreater London is most of the area surrounded by the M25 orbital motorway, and consists of 32 London Boroughs and the City of London that, together with the office of the Mayor of London, form the basis for London's local government. The Mayor of London is elected by London residents and should not be confused with the Lord Mayor of the City of London. The names of several boroughs, such as Westminster and Camden, are well-known, others less so, such as Wandsworth and Lewisham. This traveller's guide to London recognises cultural, functional and social districts of varying type and size:\n\n\n=== Central London ===\n\n\n=== Inner London ===\n\n\n=== Outer London ===\n\n\n== Understand ==\n\n\n=== History ===\nSettlements have existed on the site of London since well before Roman times, with evidence of Bronze Age and Celtic inhabitants. The Roman city of Londinium, established just after the Roman conquest of Britannia in the year 43, formed the basis for the modern city (some isolated Roman period remains are still to be seen within the City). After the end of Roman rule in 410 and a short-lived decline, London experienced a gradual revival under the Anglo-Saxons, as well as the Norsemen, and emerged as a great medieval trading city, eventually replacing Winchester as the royal capital of England. This paramount status for London was confirmed when William the Conqueror, a Norman, built the Tower of London after the conquest in 1066 and was crowned King of England in Westminster.\nLondon went from strength to strength with the rise of England to first European then global prominence, and the city became a great centre of culture, government and industry. London's long association with the theatre, for example, can be traced back to the English Renaissance (witness the Rose Theatre and great playwrights like Shakespeare who made London their home). With the rise of Britain to supreme maritime power in the 18th and 19th centuries (see Industrial Britain) and the possessor of the largest global empire, London became an imperial capital and drew people and influences from around the world to become, for many years, the largest city in the world.\nEngland's royal family has, over the centuries, added much to the London scene for today's traveller: the Albert Memorial, Buckingham Palace, Kensington Palace, Royal Albert Hall, Tower of London, Kew Palace and Westminster Abbey being prominent examples.\nDespite the decline of the British Empire, and suffering during the Second World War when London was heavily bombed by the German Luftwaffe in the Blitz, the city remains a top-tier world city: a global centre of culture, finance, and learning. Today London is easily the largest city in the United Kingdom, eight times larger than the second largest, Birmingham, and ten times larger than the third, Glasgow, and dominates the economic, political and social life of the nation. It's full of excellent bars, galleries, museums, parks and theatres. It is also the most culturally and ethnically diverse part of the country, and arguably of the whole of Europe as well, making it a great multicultural city to visit. Samuel Johnson famously said, \"when a man is tired of London, he is tired of life\". Whether you are interested in ancient history, modern art, opera or underground raves, London has it all.\n\n\n=== The City and Westminster ===\n\nHistorically London was two cities: a commercial city and a separate government capital.\nThe commercial capital was the City of London. This had a dense population and all the other pre-requisites of a medieval city: walls, a castle (The Tower of London), a cathedral (St Paul's), a semi-independent City government, a port and a bridge across which all trade was routed so Londoners could make money (London Bridge).\nAbout an hour upstream (on foot or by boat) around a bend in the river was the government capital (Westminster). This had a church for crowning the monarch (Westminster Abbey) and palaces. As each palace was replaced by a larger one, the previous one was used for government, first the Palace of Westminster (better known as the Houses of Parliament), then Whitehall, then Buckingham Palace. The two were linked by a road called The \"Strand\", the old English word for \"riverbank\".\nLondon grew both west and east. The land to the west of the City (part of the parish of Westminster) was prime farming land (Covent Garden and Soho for example) and made good building land. The land to the east was flat, marshy and cheap, good for cheap housing and industry, and later for docks. Also the wind blows 3 days out of 4 from west to east, and the Thames (into which the sewage went) flows from west to east. So the West End was up-wind and up-market, the East End was where people worked for a living.\nModern-day London in these terms is a two-centre city, with the area in between known confusingly as the West End.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nDespite having perhaps a fair reputation for being unsettled, London enjoys a mild climate on average. As much as one in three days on average will bring rain, though sometimes for only a short period. In some years, 2012 and 2018 being examples, there was no rain for a number of weeks. The fact that Londoners would find this remarkable should be an indication to visitors from drier climates of what they may be in for!\nExtreme weather is rare. Occasionally there may be heavy rain that can bring localised flooding or strong winds that may down trees and damage roofs, but overall you are unlikely to encounter anything too lively.\n\n\n===== Winter =====\nWinter in London is mild compared to nearby continental European cities due to both the presence of the Gulf Stream and the urban heat effect. The average daily maximum temperature is 8 \u00b0C (46 \u00b0F) in December and January. The coldest temperature recorded in London stands at \u221216.1 \u00b0C (3.0 \u00b0F) and was recorded at Northolt during January 1962, but this occurred during one of the coldest winters ever experienced in the UK.\nDaylight hours are very short, especially around winter, with darkness falling at 3:45PM in the afternoon in December. Sunrise is not until after 8AM in the morning around New Years.\nSnow does occur, usually a few times a year but rarely heavily (a few years being exceptions such as the winters of 2009 and 2010, with temperatures dipping down to sub-zeros regularly). Snow in London can be crippling, as seen at the end of 2010. Just 7 centimetres (2 \u00be inches) of snow will cause trains to stop running, airports to see significant delays, and the postal service to come to a halt. London is a city which does not cope well with snow; walkways, stairs, and streets will not be cleared by shovels or ploughs. The streets will be salted/gritted, but will remain slick and snow/slush covered until the sun melts it away. This is due to a lack of widespread snow-clearing infrastructure as the city does not often see snow.\n\n\n===== Spring =====\nSpring in the capital can be something of a weather rollercoaster with big variations in temperature day by day. It can be a very wet time of year, but the increases in day length from March onwards and steady temperature increases as the season progresses can make it a pleasant time to visit.\nDays can be mild and warm, but the temperature will often dip at night as the sun's warmth dissipates.\nThe beginning of spring in March can be as cold as winter, so be sure to bring something warm to wear!\n\n\n===== Summer =====\nSummer is perhaps the best season for tourists as it has long daylight hours as well as mild to warm temperatures. The average daily high temperatures in July and August are around 23.5 \u00b0C (74.3 \u00b0F) with average daily lows around 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F). On particuarly hot days, the temperature can climb up to around 29 \u00b0C (84 \u00b0F) and not go below 18.5 \u00b0C (65.3 \u00b0F) at night, but these aren't particuarly common and only happen from time to time. The highest temperature ever seen in London stands at 40.2 \u00b0C (104.4 \u00b0F) which was recorded at Heathrow on 19 July 2022. Daylight hours run from 4:45AM to 9:15PM, but begin to shorten as the summer wears on.\nHumidity across the city can increase and stay high over the course of several days and nights, leading to muggy conditions. Also, upon occasion, clouds of dust from storms in the Sahara desert can be blown across Europe and lead to increases in pollution levels.\nDespite the increased warmth, the weather in summer can be variable. Occasional prolonged instances of rain and unexpected dips in temperature can occur. If you're coming during the summer it is still advised to dress in layers and bring some waterproofs!\n\n\n===== Autumn =====\nAutumn in London can vary from year to year: in some years September and October can see temperatures similar to those seen in summer due to a phenomenon known as an \"Indian summer\", but in other years the temperature can decrease rapidly to winter levels and stay there. Autumn tends to be the wettest and windiest season but, again, this can vary from year to year. Day length at the beginning of autumn is near that of summer, meaning that a September trip can still be as easy to plan as an August one as there's plenty of daylight to work with.\nMid-autumn is a wonderful time to wander one of London's many tree-filled parks as the leaves fade from green to gold. Another benefit of a September trip is that children return to school at the beginning of the month, meaning that some tourist attractions are quieter.\n\n\n=== Tourist information ===\n Visit London. The city's tourism website. (updated Jan 2024)\n City of London Information Centre, St. Paul's Churchyard, EC4M 8BX (next to St. Paul's Cathedral), \u260f +44 20 7332-3456. M-Sa 9:30AM-5:30PM, Su 10AM-4PM. The only impartial, face-to-face source of tourist information in Central London. (updated Jan 2024)\nThere is no office for tourist information for the UK or for England. However, as of 2022, Transport for London maintains four small visitor centres at certain arrival points (see TfL website) which offer advice on key attractions, how to travel on the TfL network, buying tickets, etc.\n\n Piccadilly Circus (Piccadilly Circus Tube station). F Sa 9AM-4:30PM. (updated Aug 2022)\n Victoria Station (opposite platform 8 at Victoria rail station). Tu-Sa 9AM-4:30PM. (updated Aug 2022)\n King's Cross & St Pancras International (Kings Cross & St Pancras Tube station). Tu-Sa 9AM-4:30PM. (updated Aug 2022)\n Liverpool Street (Liverpool Street Tube station). Tu-Th 9AM-4:30PM. (updated Aug 2022)\n\n\n== Talk ==\nAs one would expect of the capital of England, English is the main language spoken in London. Accents, however, do vary from Received Pronunciation (RP), also known as the King's/Queen's English, that is spoken by the upper-class residents of Westminster, to the distinctive Cockney accent spoken by the working-class residents of the East End. However, RP has largely died out, and has been supplanted by Standard Southern English, a more modern, more middle class accent that pervades the south of the UK. Similarly, Cockney has been driven out of London, now spoken mostly in Essex. As London is one of the most culturally diverse cities in the world that is home to immigrants from all over the former British Empire, a new accent, known as Multicultural London English (MLE), has developed among younger Londoners who grew up with this cultural diversity. MLE has a Cockney base, but also incorporates noticeable influences from South Asia, Africa and the Caribbean, and is often regarded as the most representative accent of modern British society.\nMany languages from all around the world are spoken by first generation immigrants in London. For instance, Mandarin and Cantonese are commonly spoken in Chinatown and other neighbourhoods with large numbers of ethnic Chinese residents, and numerous South Asian languages such as Hindi, Urdu, Punjabi and Bengali are spoken among the various South Asian communities.\n\n\n== Get in ==\n\n\n=== By plane ===\n\nLondon receives more flights than any other city in the world.

Virtually all services operate from 21 London Victoria Coach Station , which has separate arrival and departure buildings. Some services by smaller operators may use the 22 Green Line Coach Station  nearby. Listed below are the main coach operators. It is strongly recommended to book your travel in advance: fares can be much cheaper (even a day or two can make all the difference) and you avoid ticket office queues and potentially sold-out coaches. All large and many smaller coach operators allow passengers to show tickets on their mobile phone, and all will allow passengers to print tickets at home.\n\n\n==== Domestic ====\n National Express, \u260f +44 870 580 8080. By far the largest domestic coach operator and operates services throughout Great Britain. Fares are fairly low (although usually higher than Megabus): especially when booked in advance via the web. (updated Jun 2017)\n Megabus, \u260f +44 141 352-4444 (answered by Citylink). Operates budget coach services between London and various other UK cities, and even to get to Inverness in the Scottish Highlands. Fares are demand responsive but can be very cheap (\u00a31.50 if you book far enough in advance). (updated Jun 2017)\n\n\n==== International ====\n Eurolines, \u260f +44 870 514 3219. An associate company of National Express, it runs coach services between London and various cities in Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and continental Europe (with direct services extending as far as Bucharest in Romania). (updated Jun 2017)\n Flixbus, \u260f +49 30 300 137 300. A German bus company which in 2016 took over Megabus services to and from continental Europe. Services from Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam, and Cologne. (updated Jun 2017)\n BlaBlaCar Bus. A coach company competing on the routes from Paris, Brussels, and Amsterdam. They offer newer coaches with plug sockets, Wi-Fi and reserved seating (which is especially useful for those travelling as a couple or group). (updated Jun 2017)\n Sindbad, \u260f +48 77 443 44 44. Coach services from cities throughout Poland to Victoria Coach Station. (updated Jun 2017)\n Transmarian, \u260f +40 740-635-532. Coach services from cities throughout Romania to Victoria Coach Station. (updated Nov 2022)\n RegioJet, \u260f +420 841 101 101. (formerly Student Agency) A Czech operator with a daily service from Prague, departing from the Green Line Coach Station. (updated Jun 2017)\n\n\n=== By car ===\nLondon is signposted on major routes in southern England, The Midlands and parts of Wales. Driving in London can prove expensive or - in heavy traffic - time consuming. You can park at railway stations further afield to catch the train into London if you would prefer not to drive.\nRemember to drive on the left in the UK, including London.\n\n\n==== Roads ====\nIntercity road routes in the UK are called \"motorways\" with blue signs. Other major routes are known as \"A roads\". Main routes into London include\u02d0\nFrom Scotland, The North and The Midlands\u02d0\n\n into north London - from The North and The Midlands, including Leeds, Sheffield, Nottingham, Leicester and Watford. Also from London Luton Airport.\n/ into north London - from Scotland, The North and The East Midlands, including Edinburgh, Newcastle upon Tyne and Peterborough.\n/ into west London - from Birmingham and Oxford.\n into north-west London - from Bicester, Aylesbury and Watford.\nFrom the East of England\u02d0\n\n into north-east London - from Norwich (via A11), Cambridge and Harlow. Also from London Stansted Airport.\n into north London - from Hertford.\n into east London - from Ipswich, Colchester and Chelmsford. Also from Harwich (via A120, ferries from Hook of Holland, Netherlands).\n into east London - from Southend and Tilbury.\n into east London - from Southend and Basildon.

Also from London Gatwick Airport.\n into south-west London - from Portsmouth, a port city, the South Downs National Park and Guildford.\n into south-west London - from Hastings.\nYou can use several orbital routes and ring roads to get into different parts of London once you are on the city's edges. These are\u02d0\n\n London Orbital - Sometimes known as \"Britain's biggest car park\", the M25 can bet busy. All major routes from other UK cities intersect with the London Orbital. The M25 runs around the outermost edge of London and some of the surrounding towns. There is a charge to cross the Dartford Crossing to the east of London. You can find out more about the Dart Charge on the UK Government website.\n South Circular Road - Intersects with all major routes south of the River Thames. Passes through Kew, Putney, Clapham, Dulwich, Eltham and Woolwich.\n North Circular Road - Intersects with all major routes north of the River Thames. Mostly dual-carriageway. Passes through Ealing, Wembley, Brent Cross, Finchley, Tottenham and Ilford.\nLondon Inner Ring Road - Connects Paddington, Marylebone, King's Cross, Angel, Shoreditch, Tower Bridge, Elephant and Castle, Kennington, Vauxhall, Victoria and Park Lane.\n\n\n== Get around ==\n\n \n \nThe main travel options in summary are:\n\nBy bus: This is the cheapest and usually the best way to get around London as a tourist: on most of the Underground, you won't see anything!\nBy Tube / Underground: 11 lines cover the central area and suburbs, run by TfL.\nBy Overground and the Elizabeth Line: Urban rail systems, part of TfL's network.\nBy National Rail: A complex network of suburban rail services, privately run and not part of the TfL network, although all operators now accept Oyster payments within Greater London.\nBy Docklands Light Railway (DLR): An automatic metro system running from the City to East London via the Docklands, run by TfL.\nBy foot: In central London, walking to the next Tube station often takes around 10 minutes, and is a more scenic choice than going underground. The street layout can be confusing, so a street map is essential; map and travel apps for smartphones and tablets are incredibly useful and many stations have central London printed maps for \u00a32.\nBy boat: Both commuter ferries run by TfL and pleasure cruises ply along the River Thames. Some services accept Oyster cards, but special fares apply, so check before you travel.\nBy bicycle: There are hire bicycles (known to Londoners as \"Boris Bikes\" after former London mayor Boris Johnson) operated by TfL available for pick up in inner London. You will need a credit or debit card with a PIN. If you bring your own bike, there are plenty of cycle lanes and traffic is normally considerate.\nBy tram: A tram service that operates only in southern suburbs around Croydon, Wimbledon and Bromley. Run by TfL and charges the same fares as buses.\n\n\n=== By public transport ===\n\nLondon has one of the most comprehensive public transport systems in the world. Despite residents' perpetual (and sometimes justified) grumbling about unreliability, public transport is often the best option for getting anywhere for visitors and residents alike. In central London use a combination of the transport options listed below - and check your map: in many cases, you can easily walk from one place to another or use the buses. Public transportation shuts down early on Christmas Eve, and all day on Christmas Day.\nTransport for London (TfL) is a government organisation responsible for all public transport. Their website contains maps plus an excellent journey planner. TfL publishes a useful 'coping guide' specially designed for travellers who wish to use public transport during their visit to London. TfL also offers a 24-hour travel information line, charged at a premium rate: tel +44 843 222 1234 (or text 60835) for suggestions on getting from A to B, and for up to the minute information on how services are running. Fortunately for visitors (and indeed residents) there is a single ticketing system, Oyster, which enables travellers to switch between modes of transport on one ticket.\nYou must have a valid ticket at all times when travelling by bus, tram or train in London. If you can't show a valid ticket or a validated Oyster card you will have to pay a Penalty Fare, which is usually \u00a340 (increased to \u00a380 if it isn't paid within 21 days). Always buy your ticket before you get on the train. If using an Oyster Card, ensure that you touch in and out on a yellow reader before and after travelling by Tube or train, even if there are no barriers or they are left open.\nThere are four types of tickets you can buy: the Oyster card (a contactless electronic smartcard), Travelcards (which exist both in paper form or can be loaded on your Oyster card), contactless debit or credit cards, and paper tickets. Paper tickets are significantly more expensive than paying by Oyster card or contactless card.\n\n\n==== Oyster cards ====\n\nOyster is a contactless electronic smartcard run by Transport for London. Unless you have a contactless credit or debit card, Oyster is the most cost-effective option if you plan to be in London for any more than a couple of days, or if you intend to make return visits to the city: the savings quickly recover the initial purchase cost. You can buy an Oyster card from any Tube station for a deposit of \u00a37. You can \"top up\" an Oyster card with electronic funds at ticket machines or shops displaying the \"Oyster\" logo. This money is then deducted according to where you travel. The cost of a single trip using the Oyster card is considerably less than buying a single paper ticket with cash. Prices vary depending on the distance travelled, whether by bus or Tube, and on the time of day. You can also add various electronic seven-day, 1 month and longer-period Travelcards onto an Oyster, and the card is simply validated each time you use it.\nThe deposit is fully refundable; if you have less than \u00a310 credit on your card, you can claim an instant refund of the credit and deposit at some ticket machines after 48 hours of purchase of your Oyster card. Station staff will assist you if necessary. However, your Oyster card, and the credit on it, never expires, so keep it around in case you return to London. Be prepared to give your signature on receipts or even show ID for refunds over a few pounds.\nYou can sign up for contactless and Oyster account. This will allow you to track your journeys and make refund claims for incomplete journeys.\nVisitor Oyster card is a version of the normal Oyster card targeted to travellers. This version of the Oyster card can be purchased from some travel agents outside London and overseas or ordered by mail. This card can also be sent back to TfL by mail after a trip to London to claim a refund for the unused balance. Visitor Oyster cards come pre-charged with pay-as-you-go credit: in increments from \u00a310 to \u00a350. The card itself costs \u00a35 non refundable fee plus postage. With a Visitor Oyster card you can also get some discounts in various venues across the city. The Visitor Oyster cards are for pay as you go use only and cannot be registered to provide protection against loss or topped up from the Oyster smart-phone app.\nIf you have a National Railcard, such as the 16-25 Railcard or the Senior Railcard, you can register this with your Oyster card at a Tube station (members of staff near ticket machines can do this) to receive a 33% discount on off-peak pay-as-you-go fares on rail & tube.\n\n\n===== Validity of your Oyster =====\nOyster is valid on all red London buses, and almost all trains in London: a list of destinations is available on the London Rail and Tube Services map. Oyster is not valid on buses or trains outside London: if you need to travel beyond the stations on the map, you will have to pay for a paper ticket. Oyster is also not accepted on long-distance coaches, tour buses, or charter buses. Despite being shown on the Tube map, Elizabeth line services from Iver to Reading don't accept Oyster.\nThe following table summarises the validity of the different tickets you can use on Oyster. For most tourists, the Tube, trains, and buses are the only transport you will use. Although Oyster can be used to and from Heathrow and Gatwick airports, peak fares are charged at all times.\n\n\n===== Using your Oyster card =====\n\nWhen using your Oyster card to travel, make sure the reader is displaying an orange light, then place it flat against the reader. A single beep and a green light mean your card has been accepted, and you can proceed. Two beeps and a red light mean your card has not been accepted. Take the card off the reader, wait for the orange light, and try again; if this continues to happen, ask for help from a member of staff. Don't try to insert your Oyster card into the slot at the ticket gates!\nWhen getting on any kind of train, you must touch your Oyster card on the yellow circular reader at the start and end of your journey. At stations with ticket gates, these readers will be on the right-hand side of the gates. In the outlying parts of the city there are no entry or exit gates at some stations. In this case, the readers are on free-standing cabinets next to entrances/exits. Failing to touch out when you leave a station will result in you being charged a maximum fare for your journey, since the system doesn't know which station you left from. The maximum fare is between \u00a35.40 and \u00a314.20, and depends on the station where you started your journey.\nUsually you will not need to touch your Oyster card on a reader when changing trains. However, some stations have pink Oyster \"route validators\" on the platforms: if you are getting off one train and getting onto another at one of these stations, touch your Oyster on the pink reader so that the system charges you the right fare for the route you have taken. There are a few other situations where you might have to touch out when changing trains (usually when changing between Tube, DLR and/or National Rail) - in these cases make sure you touch back in before getting on your next train.\nWhen using a London bus or a tram, touch in once when getting on. Don't touch out when you get off the bus or you will be charged twice. Most buses have their Oyster reader next to the driver. Trams and some buses have Oyster readers on poles next to the doors.\nYou can make a change to another bus or a tram free of charge during one hour. You'll still have to touch your Oyster on the 2nd bus or tram, but no money will be deducted then.\nContactless credit or debit cards or other RFID identity cards may interfere with your Oyster if you keep them in the same wallet. This usually results in an error message but may mean you get charged the full fare from your contactless credit or debit card instead. Be careful standing near the readers on some buses - they are often quite sensitive and may read your card from several centimetres away, even if you did not intend this. It is best to remove the card from the wallet or purse it is in.\n\n\n===== Pay-as-you-go (PrePay) with your Oyster =====\nYou can top up your Oyster card with cash at any Tube station ticket machine or ticket office (you can use a credit card if it has a PIN) with Oyster pay-as-you-go, also known as PrePay. Money is then deducted from your Oyster card each time you travel. When travelling by train, the fare is calculated based on where you started and ended your journey. Pay-as-you-go is much cheaper than paying by cash for each journey, especially if you make multiple trips. Bus fares are flat and you will be charged the same fare every time you get on the bus, regardless of distance.\nThe amount of Oyster credit deducted from your card in one day is capped to a daily limit. This means that on a day-to-day basis, you will always get the best fares when using Oyster pay-as-you-go. Even if you travel by bus only, your total fares are also capped, this makes bus travel very good value in central London if you are making lots of journeys.\n\n\n==== Travelcards ====\nA Travelcard gives you unlimited travel on trains within the relevant zones, and on red London buses. A Travelcard is typically loaded onto your Oyster, but for periods longer than 7 days, you will usually need to register your Oyster card or provide some form of photographic I.D.\nFor an up-to-date and comprehensive list of fares, see TfL's website.\nIf you are using Oyster and travel beyond the zones of your Travelcard, you will be charged an extension fare from your pay-as-you-go credit when you touch out at your destination.\n\n\n==== Contactless payment cards ====\nContactless credit/debit cards, Apple Pay and Google Pay can be used to pay fares anywhere Oyster is accepted. Most Visa, MasterCard, Maestro, Cirrus or American Express cards issued outside the UK are accepted. Some pre-paid cards may work as well. Some cards such as Visa contactless cards issued in the United States will not work.\nWhen you enter or leave a station or get on the bus, touch the card against the yellow validation reader as if it were an Oyster card. The price is the same as with an Oyster card. The price per day is automatically capped at the price of a day ticket. You also avoid the queues at ticket machines, the \u00a35 deposit for an Oyster card, and you never have to top it up. A Travelcard can not be loaded onto a contactless card. The same card cannot be used by two or more different passengers. You must use the same device to touch in and out, otherwise you may get charged for two journeys - for example, if you touch in using your smartphone but touch out using your physical card, the system may get confused and charge you twice, even if the phone is linked to the same card.\nYou may notice a charge of \u00a30.10 on your bank statement shortly after you touch in for the first time - this is normal. This will change to the price of all your travel for that day, usually overnight but sometimes it can take a few days.\nUsing a contactless card as a visitor from abroad may be tricky though. Your bank may ask for additional confirmations, so TfL may suspend accepting a card until you release a pending payment. Also sometimes you may end up with an unfinished journey even though you've touched an exit gate probably because a card may require a bit longer to process after a gate is opened. Keep your card at a reader until the gate opens fully. You can sign up for a contactless and Oyster account to check for these issues.\n\n\n==== Fares ====\nEvery station where you can use Oyster or contactless payment is in a \"fare zone\" from 1 to 9 - you can see what zone a station is in on the Tube Map (look for the shaded areas and numbers in the background). Some stations on the boundary of two zones have their name written in a white box, which means they're considered to be in both zones (for example Earl's Court is in zones 1 and 2). If your journey starts or ends at one of these stations, the system will work out which zone would result in the cheapest fare and charge that.\nThe price of a journey is determined by how many zones it passes through. In general, the more zones you travel through, the higher the fare, with journeys passing through Zone 1 (most stations in Central London) being more expensive than ones going around it. TfL's website has a single fare finder tool that can be used to work out the price of a journey between any two stations. Most journeys have both a peak and off-peak fare - a peak journey is one starting between 06:30 and 09:30 and between 16:00 and 19:00 on working days (excluding public holidays).\nPay as you go fares are capped: once the fares for all your journeys on the same day add up to a certain amount (which varies depending on all the zones travelled), any further travel that day will be free. There are also weekly caps, covering all travel within a calendar week. Caps are calculated separately for peak and off-peak travel. Note that, even once you have reached a daily or weekly cap, you still need to touch in and out for each journey, otherwise you are traveling without a valid ticket - though you won't be charged anything for it. If you use a combination of Tube, zone 1-6 railway, and bus journeys, the Tube's fare caps (based on the farthest zone you travelled to) will apply to all your journeys for that day.\n\n\n==== Paper tickets ====\nIt's still possible to pay for a journey by a paper single or return ticket. However, this only makes sense if you take perhaps two to three journeys on public transport during your trip to London as they cost significantly more (roughly double the cost) in comparison with the other means of payment.\nSeason tickets can also be purchased in paper.\n\n\n=== Accessibility ===\nIf you have a physical disability, you might find it harder to travel around London. The oldest parts of the Underground date from the middle of the 19th century, and some of the surface rail network is even older. Therefore, much of the transport system wasn't built to cater for people with disabilities; narrow, winding passageways, steep staircases, and cavernous gaps between some platforms and trains are all barriers for certain passengers.\nHowever, times and attitudes have changed: all stations, lines and trains built since the 1990s are accessible and many older stations have been retrofitted with lifts and ramps. In addition, all London buses and trams have low-floor doors, access ramps and space onboard for at least one wheelchair user; most black cabs (taxis) are also accessible. That said, there are still significant gaps in accessibility, particularly on the Tube in Central London.\nTo help you navigate, TfL publish several maps to cater for different needs:\n\nThe standard Tube map marks all stations that are step-free from either street to platform (white wheelchair symbol) or street to train (blue wheelchair symbol).\nThe Step-free Tube map goes into more detail, indicating the height difference between platform and train floor-level.\nThe Large-print Tube map and Black-and-white Tube map serve travellers with visual impairments.\nThe Audio Tube map is available to stream or download, however as of early 2023 it was last updated in 2016.\nFor more info, visit the transport accessibility portal on the TfL website.\n\n\n=== By Underground ===\n\nThe London Underground, known popularly as the Tube due to its tube-like tunnels drilled through the London clay, is a network of 11 lines which criss-cross London in one of the largest underground rail networks in the world. It was also the first: the oldest section, from Paddington to Farringdon, opened as the Metropolitan Railway in 1863. The Tube is an easy method of transport even for new visitors to London and is equivalent to subway and metro systems in other world cities.\nThe routes operated by the London Underground fall into 2 broad types: the older \"sub-surface\" lines, encompassing the Metropolitan, District, Circle and Hammersmith & City lines, date from the 19th century. The \"deep level\" routes were largely constructed in the early-to-mid-20th century. The sub-surface lines are usually accessed by walking down a short set of stairs, whereas the deep-level lines are accessed by a complicated network of escalators or lifts. \nThe sub-surface lines use larger trains thanks to their larger tunnel size. The deep-level tube lines are served by the iconic tube-shaped trains which, despite their small size, can only just fit through the tunnels. The deep-level trains do not have air conditioning, which can make them unbearably hot in the summer. Yet the situation will be improved in the future, as TfL will gradually introduce new trains that have air conditioning.\nEach line has stations with interesting architectural and artistic features typical of the era they were opened. As you travel around the network, look out for Victorian finery, Edwardian glazed tiles, smooth Art Deco symmetry, and striking modern masterpieces. Various conservation pieces are also present, such as the heritage 1900s station name roundel sign at Caledonian Road on the westbound platform.\nTrains on most days and on most lines run from around 5:30AM to around 1AM. They are usually the fastest way to travel in London, the only problem being the relative expense and the fact that they can get extremely crowded during rush hours (7:30-10AM and 4:30-7PM). There is no air conditioning on the deep-level trains, which can make them unbearably hot in the summer. TfL's website has a page notifying of tracking delays, closures, and planned engineering works, which you should check if you plan to travel on a Saturday or a Sunday, when entire lines may be shut down due to engineering works.\nIf you're travelling around central London then taking the Tube for just one stop can be a waste of time. For example, to travel between Leicester Square and Covent Garden stations takes over 10 minutes on the Tube, despite the two stations being only a few minutes walk apart. This is especially true since the walk from a Tube station entrance to the platform at some central stations can be extensive. The Tube map also gives no information on London's extensive bus network, or any of its National Rail network except for Thameslink. For more information see the 'By foot' section.\n\n\n==== Night Tube ====\nThe Night Tube is a limited 24-hour Tube service that operates on certain lines on Fridays and Saturdays.\nNight Tube fares are the same as the off-peak fares during the day. Day Travelcards are valid on the day they were issued (using the date printed on the card) and for journeys starting before 4:30AM the following day. For example, if you buy a Day Travelcard at 11AM on Friday, you can use it until 4:29AM on the following Saturday. Daily capping on Oyster cards and contactless payment cards also applies.\nAs of 2024, the Night Tube services run on the following lines:\n\nCentral line: Trains run approximately every 10 minutes between White City and Leytonstone, and approximately every 20 minutes on the Ealing Broadway to White City, and Leytonstone to Loughton/Hainault sections. There is no service between North Acton and West Ruislip, Loughton and Epping, and Woodford and Hainault.\nJubilee line: Trains run every 10 minutes on average along the entire line.\nNorthern line: Trains run every 15 minutes on average, between High Barnet or Edgware and Morden, via the Charing Cross branch (so every 7-8 minutes between Camden Town and Morden). No service on the Bank branch, or to Battersea Power Station or Mill Hill East.\nPiccadilly line: Trains run every 10 minutes on average, between Heathrow Terminals 5 and 2&3 and Cockfosters. No service to Terminal 4, or between Uxbridge and Acton Town.\nVictoria line: Trains run every 10 minutes on average along the entire line.\nLondon Overground: Trains run every 15-20 minutes on average along the Windrush line between Highbury & Islington and New Cross Gate. No service on other Overground lines.\n\n\n==== Ticketing ====\nTravel on the Tube system will always require the purchase of a ticket or the use of an Oyster card or contactless payment card if you have one; fare evasion is treated as a serious matter and will get you a fine.\nSingle tickets are charged at two rates, depending on the payment method. Cash fares and single Oyster fares are zonal, meaning that the price of a journey is determined by the zones you travelled through. There are additional fares payable for zones beyond 9, but these are mostly outside what is considered London.\nPaper travelcards valid for 1 day or 7 days are also available and can also be used on buses, National Rail trains, the DLR and trams - however there is a capping feature for contactless and Oyster cards (which guarantees a strict upper bound on the fare you pay for a day and a week) which means that a paper travelcard is unnecessary and costlier.\nAlmost all stations have automatic ticket barriers. If you pay by Oyster card or a contactless payment card, just tap your card against the yellow pad to open the barriers (ensure that you do this upon both entrance and exit). If you have a paper ticket, insert it face-up into the slot on the front of the machine, and remove it from the top to enter the station. If you have a single ticket it will be retained at the exit gate. If you have luggage or if your ticket is rejected there is normally a staffed gate as well.\nPaper tickets can be purchased from vending machines in the station's ticket hall. The touchscreen machines have instructions in multiple languages, offer a greater choice of ticket and accept bills and credit/debit cards (if your card has no embedded microchip, you cannot use these machines; these machines do not support contactless). You can also add Oyster pay-as-you-go credit on many mainline ticket vending machines in London.\nIf you have a national train ticket, which involves travelling across London (e.g. Brighton to Darlington), you may be able to travel on the Tube across London, from one London terminus to another. If your train ticket has \"Any permitted \u2020\" (with the dagger symbol) written in the \"Route\" section (at the bottom of the ticket), then you are able to travel on the Tube without buying another ticket. These can be used at the ticket barriers in the same way as the paper tickets described above.\n\n\n==== Navigation ====\nThe Tube is made up of 11 lines each bearing a traditional name and a standard colour on the Tube map (e.g. the Circle line in yellow, Central line in red, Piccadilly line in dark blue). Since the Tube map is well designed it is very easy to work out how to get between any two stations, and since each station is clearly signed it is easy to work out when to exit your train. The Tube map is a diagram and not a scaled map, making it misleading for determining the relative distance between stations as it makes central stations appear further apart and somewhat out of place - the most distant reaches of the Metropolitan Line for example are almost 64 km (40 mi) from the centre of the city. Tube maps are freely available from any station, most tourist offices, and are prominently displayed in stations. The National Rail map showing National Rail services is displayed as a large poster at most Tube stations.\nThere are many lines with multiple branches rather than running point-to-point, and it's also possible that some trains will not run the full line, so always check the train's destination, which is shown on the front of the train and the platform indicator screens, and will be broadcast on the train's PA. A typical announcement will be like: \"This is a Piccadilly line service to Cockforsters.\"\nMost branches are only served by specific services; from the eastern end of the District line at Upminster, for instance, you can only catch trains for Ealing Broadway and Richmond - if you want to go to Wimbledon, you will have to change trains later down the line, like at Earl's Court.\nNormally trains stop at all stations with the exception of the Metropolitan line, which have semi-fast and fast service patterns from Amersham and Chesham, that skip all stations between Moor Park and Harrow-on-the-Hill (fast only), and between Harrow-on-the-Hill and Wembley Park. It's also possible that some stations may closed due to some reason, and trains will not stop there, so please pay attention on announcements for any service changes.\nThere are several sections where more than one line will share tracks with others, or even other services (like Overground and National Rail services), which they may stop at the same platform, so you should pay extra attention for the right train. Mostly you can differentiate the different services by the type of train, though this is not possible on the Circle, District, Hammersmith & City and Metropolitan lines, since all four use the same rolling stock on shared lines. Here you will need to pay attention to announcements and signs on the platform and trains.\nSigns can be vague, especially if you are unfamiliar with what compass point direction (e.g. northbound) you're travelling in, as these are most often given rather than destinations. A person new to the Tube can become very frustrated trying to work out where a particular connection at a particular station is found. Central and busy stations are staffed by at least two members of staff at all times who can advise you on your route and full system maps are on the walls of every platform and ticket office. Additionally, on every platform, there are individual line maps showing all the stations served by trains calling at that platform. It is always advisable to carry a pocket Tube map to help you with this; the TfL Go and Citymapper apps are also handy tools.\nThe Northern line has two routes through central London which split at Euston and rejoin at Kennington. The Charing Cross branch runs through the West End, while the Bank branch runs through the City of London. To work out which way your train is going, check the signs above the platform, and on the front of the train. The train's destination and central branch will also be announced on board, for example \"This is a Northern line train via Charing Cross, terminating at Edgware.\" A similar announcement will also appear on the Hainault Loop section on the Central line in North East London.\nThe London Underground has connections to all terminals at Heathrow and most major London rail termini, with the exception of Fenchurch Street (although this is walking distance from Tower Hill and Aldgate). Interchange hubs are also served, such as Farringdon, Elephant & Castle, Harrow & Wealdstone and Stratford.\n\n\n==== Onboard ====\nBe considerate of your fellow passengers as best you can. Pushing and rushing are seen as extremely rude - there's not much need to run for a Tube train unless it's the very last one of the day! Also, trying to strike up a conversation with strangers is seen as peculiar and will instantly mark you out as a tourist. Despite having a reputation as being aloof Londoners are usually happy to help out if you have a problem, but otherwise they'd rather you didn't try to be overly familiar.\nIn some cases (particularly for the sub-surface lines), the tube doors have buttons on the outside. They normally come to use if a train is waiting for over 45 seconds, as the doors will automatically close to conserve energy. If the train isn't ready to depart (which is easy to check - if the button isn't illuminated, the train is ready to depart), pressing the button will open the doors.\n\n\n==== Crime, safety, and accidents ====\nWhen using the escalators, always stand on the right to allow people in a hurry to pass. Drinking alcohol or smoking anywhere on the London Underground is illegal.\nCrime levels on the Tube are comparable to but typically lower than in many other subway systems, and traveller advice about watching luggage and valuables is reasonable. The Tube system is covered by an extensive CCTV system, although it is not advised to be reliant on this fact when travelling.\nThe London Underground considers its safety record to be a matter of professional honour, major incidents being incredibly rare (despite the media attention they generate). Front-line staff are well trained for emergencies and will follow well-rehearsed procedures. In addition, front-line staff are generally appreciative of traveller vigilance, if concerns are politely expressed. If you notice something that concerns you please speak to a member of staff or a British Transport Police officer.\n\n\n===== Getting help =====\nOn the wall of the platforms (or freestanding on outdoor platforms) there will be a round, white device labelled \"Help Point\" with one or two buttons and a fire alarm. Press the green button to alert staff to an emergency and press the blue button to ask for non-urgent assistance. If you see smoke or fire always use the fire alarm first.\n\n\n====== On the train ======\nOn Tube trains you will notice that there is a red handle you can pull to alert the driver to a serious incident or accident occurring on the train. If the train is in a tunnel the alarm should only be used in dire emergencies that require immediate attention, as pulling the alarm will activate the train's brakes. In practice, when the alarm is activated, a driver will move the train forward into the next station where help can be obtained. Therefore, the alarms should only be used in stations if possible as passengers will then be able to escape the train quickly if needed.\nTfL advise travellers to carefully consider their usage of the passenger alarm and, if suitable, leave the train at the next station and seek help from station staff instead. Because trains on the London Underground are run close together any delays can have serious knock-on effects for the rest of the service. In contrast, train drivers vary in their opinion as to when the alarm should be used: Consensus tends to be that if it's something you would run down the train to tell the driver then the alarm should definitely be used.\n\n\n===== Lost items =====\nOwing to a heightened security climate, and a history of political violence targeting the Tube, unattended baggage may be treated as a suspect or explosive device and may be destroyed. Lost items (if not destroyed) will end up at the Lost Property Office and will be stored for 3 months. You will need to fill in a form online describing your lost item and TfL will contact you if it is found. There is a charge for recovery of most items, however some items (e.g. Laptops) have higher fees.\n\n\n=== By bus ===\n\nLondon's iconic red Routemaster buses, which are recognised the world over, were withdrawn from regular service in 2005. Although a heritage service was continued on portions of two routes, this ceased in 2019. Routemasters are still used for tours and private parties.\nBuses are generally quicker than taking the Tube for shorter (less than a couple of stops on the Tube) trips, and out of central London you're likely to be closer to a bus stop than a Tube station. Most buses in London are very frequent (at least every ten minutes) and are accessible for buggies and wheelchairs. Buses also have a flat rate fare which stays the same no matter how far you travel. You will need to pay the fare again if you board a different bus, although the Hopper fare allows you to take as many buses as you like in 62 minutes and only pay for the first one.\nOver 5 million bus trips are made each weekday; with over 700 different bus routes you are never far from a bus. Each bus stop has a sign listing the routes that stop there and bus routes are identified by numbers and sometimes letters. Buses have very clear blinds on the front, with their route number and their destination. Transport for London produces all Bus route maps.\n\n\n==== Using the bus ====\n\nWhen you see your bus approaching, signal clearly to the driver that you intend to get on their bus: the way to do this is to stick your hand out, with an open palm. The driver will indicate and pull into the stop. Always wait for people to get off the bus before you enter.\nMost buses have two doors. Form an orderly queue at the front door: when you reach the driver, touch your Oyster or contactless payment card on the reader or show them your Travelcard or pass (importantly, cash is not accepted). Some buses are worked by the \"New Routemaster\": you can get on this bus at any of its three doors, as long as you touch in your Oyster or contactless payment card as soon as you board. It should be noted that unlike the Tube, you are allowed to use an Oyster card which has zero (but not negative) or insufficient balance - this will cause the balance to be negative (the machines will flash an \"Emergency fare charged\" message which is the same as the normal fare); however, you must then recharge before the card can be used again.\nIf you are a wheelchair user, you should indicate as normal, and wait by the second door from the front. The driver will activate the wheelchair ramp for you to use.\nMost buses have a system that provides visual and audible announcements of the bus's destination at every stop, the stops, and nearby landmarks.\nWhen you are nearing your stop, press one of the red \"STOP\" buttons on the handrails once only. You'll hear a bell, or a buzzer, and the words \"Bus Stopping\" will appear on the destination screen. Get off the bus using the middle or rear door. There is also a blue \"stop\" button by the wheelchair space - this indicates to the driver that the wheelchair ramp is required at the next stop.\nFinally, always watch out for moving traffic, cyclists and pedestrians, when you get off the bus.\n\n\n==== Fares ====\nIt is not possible to buy tickets on the bus so you must have a valid Travelcard, Oyster card or contactless credit or debit card before you get on. Alternatively, tickets may be purchased from most newsagents in London, or from ticket machines at certain central London stops. The adult bus fare is \u00a31.75; discounts are available to holders of certain cards that must be applied for in advance. \nUnlike on the Tube, you are charged for each bus you travel on. If you change buses then you will normally be charged a new bus fare up to the daily/weekly price cap. However, the Hopper fare allows you to make unlimited bus or tram journeys for the price of one if you use an Oyster card or contactless payment method. All of your journeys must be made within an hour of touching in on the first bus or tram you are travelling on and you must also use the same Oyster or contactless card for the other journeys.\n\n\n===== Oyster =====\nIf you have a seven-day, monthly or yearly Travelcard or Bus and Tram Pass on your Oyster, that includes free bus travel across all of London, even outside the zones of your Travelcard (buses aren't subject to zones). You still must touch in when you get on the bus, but you won't be charged.\nIf you do not have a Travelcard, the fare is taken from your Oyster pay as you go credit as soon as you touch in when you get on the bus. Daily bus and tram travel is \"capped\", so you generally won't pay more than an equivalent travelcard.\nUnlike the Tube, you are allowed to use an Oyster card which has zero (but not negative) or insufficient balance - this will cause the balance to be negative (the machines will flash an \"Emergency fare charged\" message which is the same as the normal fare); however, you must then recharge before the card can be used again.\nTouch your Oyster on the reader as soon as you get on the bus or you may be liable to a Penalty Fare or prosecution.\n\n\n===== Contactless credit, debit or prepaid cards =====\nYou can also pay for with most contactless debit, credit or prepaid Visa, MasterCard/Maestro or American Express cards. You touch the card flat against the reader, like you would with an Oyster card, but your account is charged instead. Some foreign-issued cards will not work for contactless payment.\nThe total charges for that day are calculated and taken out of your account overnight. As with Oyster, you are charged for each bus fare, up to a cap each day. In addition, a weekly price cap applies from Monday to Sunday.\nSee above for further information on contactless payment.\n\n\n===== Concessions =====\nChildren aged 10 and under travel for free on the bus when accompanied by an adult. Children between the ages of 11 and 15 must touch in using a Zip card, yet journeys are still free on buses. If they do not have a Zip card they must pay the full fare using an adult Oyster or contactless card. 16-18 Student Oyster cards (only available to students studying in London) go up to age 18 and journeys are still free. Residents of England who have an ENCTS free bus pass (for the elderly or disabled) also get free travel: simply show your pass to the driver or conductor.\n\n\n==== Night buses ====\n\nStandard bus services run from around 6AM-12:30AM. Around half past midnight the network changes to the vast night bus network of well over 100 routes stretching all over the city. There are two types of night buses: 24-hour routes and N-prefixed routes.\n24-hour services keep the same number as during the day and will run exactly the same route, such as the number 88, for example. N-prefixed routes are generally very similar to their day-route, but may take a slightly different route or are extended to serve areas that are further out. For example, the 29 bus goes from Trafalgar Square to Wood Green during the day; however, the N29 bus goes from Trafalgar Square to Wood Green and then continues to Enfield.\nNight buses run at a 30-minute frequency at minimum, with many routes at much higher frequencies up to every 5 minutes.\nPrices stay the same, and daily Travelcards are valid until 04:29 the day after they were issued, so can be used on night buses. Most bus stops will have night bus maps with all the buses to and from that local area on it, although it is good to check on the TfL website beforehand, which also has all those maps easily available.\n\n\n=== By DLR ===\nDocklands Light Railway (DLR) is a dedicated light rail network operating in East London, connecting with the Tube network at Bank, Tower Gateway (close to Tower Hill station), Canning Town, Heron Quays (close to Canary Wharf Tube station), and Stratford. As the trains operate automatically, it can be quite exciting \u2013 especially for children \u2013 to sit at the front and look out through the window, whilst feeling as though one is driving the train oneself. The DLR runs above ground on much of its route, and travels through many scenic parts of London, including the Docklands area where most of London's skyscrapers are located.\nThe DLR can be a little confusing as the routes are not easily distinguished, however there are network maps on the train and the platform. Check the displays on the platform which will show you the destination and the wait for the next three trains, and also check the destination displays on the front and side of the train and listen for announcements. At busy times, some trains do not run the full length of the route. In this instance, you should take the first train, listen for announcements, and change where necessary.\nBe extra careful at Canning Town station, as it is very busy and four different DLR lines run through it. Use station signage to work out which platform you need; for example all services towards Stratford International use platform 2.\n\n\n==== Ticketing ====\nUnlike on the Tube, most DLR stations do not have ticket gates (except for Bank and Stratford) as they are unstaffed. Also, unlike the Tube, you do need to push the buttons to open the doors.\nYou can top up an Oyster card, buy a Travelcard or buy a paper ticket (at a substantial premium) from the ticket machines at the station. Most stations are unstaffed, so if you want to pay by cash then make sure you have plenty of change! As there are no gates, when travelling by Oyster you must always remember to touch in at the start of your journey and touch out at the end. Even if you are changing to the Underground at Canary Wharf/Heron Quays, you must still touch in/out at the DLR station: the system will recognise that you have made an interchange between the two stations and treat it as part of the same journey.\n\n\n=== By train ===\nWikivoyage has a guide to Rail travel in Great Britain, with information applicable to the National Rail system within London.\nThe British railway system is known as National Rail (although some older signs still refer to it as \"British Rail\"). London's suburban rail services are operated by several private companies under tightly-written government contracts, and mostly run in the south of the city away from the main tourist sights. Only one line (Thameslink) runs through central London - on a north-south axis between London Bridge or Blackfriars stations, and the underground level of St Pancras main line station. There is no one central station - instead, there are twelve mainline stations dotted around the edge of the central area, and most are connected by the Circle line (except Euston, Fenchurch Street and those south of the river like Waterloo and London Bridge).\nMost visitors will not need to use National Rail services except for a few specific destinations such as Wimbledon, Hampton Court, Kew Gardens (Kew Bridge station), Windsor Castle, Greenwich, or the airports, or indeed if they are intending to visit other destinations in the UK. It's important to know that the quickest route between two stations is often a combination of the Tube as well as National Rail trains. For instance, if you are going from central London to Wimbledon, it will usually be much quicker to go to Waterloo and take the first Wimbledon train (around 15 minutes, maximum) rather than take the District line, which can take up to 45 minutes.\nYour pay-as-you-go Oyster card is valid in London zones 1-9 (and some extensions), but not beyond, so be careful \u2014 if you want to travel beyond the London zones you will need to buy a paper ticket from the ticket office at the station. If you travel beyond the London zones with no valid ticket, you will be charged a Penalty Fare (on National Rail services this is usually \u00a320), you will have to buy another ticket for the remainder of your journey, and you will also be charged the maximum Oyster fare because you didn't touch out. This adds up to a lot, so be careful and make sure you plan your journey! If in doubt, ask at the ticket office. Importantly, there are stations where contactless payment but not Oyster is accepted - watch out for them.\nThere are express trains to and from Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports. Tickets are often sold at a substantial premium, so you may want to consider taking the slightly slower 'stopping' services instead: for instance, an Anytime single from Victoria to Gatwick costs more on the Gatwick Express, then when marked \"Route Southern Only\"\u2014taking a Southern train to Gatwick is only eight minutes longer. Similarly, while the journey from Paddington station to Heathrow Airport by Elizabeth Line will take around 10-15 minutes longer than by Heathrow Express, the walk-up fare will be twice as cheap (and even cheaper on the Tube, though the journey takes considerably longer), so it's often only worth the premium when you're in a hurry. Oyster cards are only valid to Heathrow when travelling by Tube, Heathrow Express, or the Elizabeth Line, to Gatwick by National Rail (including Gatwick Express), and to City by DLR. To all other airports they are not valid.\nDon't throw your ticket away until you're out of the station at your destination! Many stations have ticket gates which you will need to put your ticket through to exit; also, you need to retain all the parts of your ticket throughout your journey, as a member of railway staff may need to see it.\n\n\n=== By Overground ===\n\nIn common parlance, Londoners may refer to travelling by \"overground\", meaning going by National Rail (as opposed to going by Underground). However, only London Overground is a Transport for London rail service, which serves most boroughs of the capital. Oyster cards are accepted. Trains will usually run a minimum frequency of every 15 minutes, and some stations have a considerably more frequent service. The trains have big windows allowing for great \"urban scenic\" views.\nThe Overground appears on the Tube map as a double orange line. TfL also produces a map only showing Overground services. At many stations, trains leaving from the same platform will go to different destinations, so listen carefully for announcements and always check the destination on the front of the train. The Overground can be a great way to avoid changing trains in central London by skirting around the centre. It's also well-connected: you can frequently change for Underground trains, other Overground destinations, or for mainline National Rail services from Stratford, Clapham Junction and Watford Junction.\nThe different Overground services will be given distinct line names and colours from autumn 2024:\n\nLiberty line (  grey) between Romford and Upminster.\nLioness line (  yellow) between Euston and Watford Junction.\nMildmay line (  blue) between Stratford and Willesden Junction, where it splits into two branches to Richmond and Clapham Junction.\nSuffragette line (  light green) between Gospel Oak and Barking Riverside.\nWeaver line (  purple/maroon) starting at Liverpool Street, with three branches to Chingford, Cheshunt and Enfield Town.\nWindrush line (  red/pink) starting at Highbury and Islington, with four branches to Clapham Junction, New Cross, Crystal Place and West Croydon.\n\n\n=== By the Elizabeth line ===\n\nThe Elizabeth line is London's newest railway line. It appears on the Tube map as a double purple line. It runs from Reading and Heathrow Airport in the west to Abbey Wood and Shenfield in the east via London Paddington, Farringdon, London Liverpool St and Stratford. Compared to the Underground, it has longer and faster trains that stop less frequently. It is fully wheelchair-accessible (although boarding ramps are necessary at some stations) and the trains are air-conditioned.\n\n\n=== By Tram ===\nThe London Trams network is centred on Croydon, where it runs on street-level tracks around the Croydon Loop, providing transit to an area not well-served by the Tube or National Rail. Route 3 (Wimbledon to New Addington - green on the  tram map) is the most frequent service, running every 7 or 8 minutes Monday to Saturday daytime and every 15 minutes at all other times. Beckenham is served by Routes 1 and 2 (yellow and red on the tram map), which terminate at Elmers End and Beckenham Junction respectively. All services travel around the Loop via West Croydon and run every 10 minutes Monday to Saturday daytime and every 30 minutes at all other times. Between Arena and Sandilands, these two services serve the same stops.\n\n\n=== On foot ===\n\nLondon is a surprisingly compact city, making it a walker's delight. In many instances, walking is the quickest method of transport between two points.\nBecause Britain drives on the left hand side of the road, for most foreign visitors it can be all too easy to forget that traffic will come at you from the opposite direction than you are used to when crossing a street - for this reason remember to look right when you cross the road. If you are using a pedestrian crossing, don't risk it even if you can't see any traffic coming: Wait for the green man to appear and then cross quickly and carefully. Some pedestrian crossings now have countdown timers to indicate how long it will be safe to cross for.\nParticularly on Central London's busiest streets, it is easy to spot native Londoners as they weave in and out of the large crowds at fast speed; tourists who cannot will stand out. Make sure you're aware of your surroundings when in London\u2014Londoners are usually very considerate, but a group of tourists standing in the middle of the pavement can be a major annoyance! Try standing to the side of busy pavements and footpaths, especially if you're with a group.\n\n\n==== Walking alternatives to the Tube ====\nIn some instances, it can be faster to walk some or all of your intended route instead of taking the Tube. By looking at a map you'll notice that some central London Tube stations are a lot closer together than the Tube map would make you believe. TfL have produced a map detailing the walking time and number of steps between various popular stations.\nHere are some more specific instructions for some of the stations that you are likely to use as a tourist:\n\nLeicester Square station \u2013 Covent Garden station: Come out of the station with The Hippodrome Casino behind you. Cross Charing Cross Road and walk up Cranbourn Street. Walk straight over at the junction and continue onto Long Acre. Walk straight up Long Acre to arrive at Covent Garden station. Approximate walking time: 5 minutes\nHolborn station \u2013 Covent Garden station: Exit the station onto Kingsway, opposite a large Sainsbury's shop (if you exit onto High Holborn opposite a McDonald's - turn left, and round the corner). Cross Kingsway (this is a very busy road), and turn left on the other side. Take the second right (by a Starbucks) onto Great Queen Street. Walk straight, crossing over Drury Lane onto Long Acre. Continue on Long Acre, crossing over Endell Street/Bow Street. Covent Garden station will be on your left. Approximate walking time: 10 minutes.\nEmbankment station \u2013 Waterloo station: Come out of the station onto Victoria Embankment, walk up the stairs and head across the River Thames using the Hungerford Bridge. At the other end of the bridge keep walking straight and away from the River Thames. Follow the railway line. You will come to some blue metal work and a walkway underneath the railway line called Sutton Walk. Follow this, cross the road and Waterloo station is ahead of you. Approximate walking time: 15 minutes\nWestminster station \u2013 Waterloo station: Come out of the station and head across the River Thames using Westminster Bridge. Keep heading straight until you come to a junction. Turn left and walk down York Road. Stay on York Road until you come to a railway bridge. Waterloo station will be on your right. Approximate walking time: 15 minutes\nGreen Park station \u2013 Hyde Park Corner station: Come out of Green Park station onto the road. This is Piccadilly. Walk west along Piccadilly following the edge of Green Park. When you come to a roundabout head straight across it. Hyde Park Corner station will be on your right. Approximate walking time: 10 minutes\nQueensway \u2013 Bayswater: Turn to the left when exiting the station and keep walking. This is a good route if you want to quickly change to a different Tube line but not change at Notting Hill Gate. Approximate walking time: 1 minute\n\n\n===== Oxford Circus station =====\nOxford Circus station can become extremely busy on weekday evenings and, if convenient, it is worth walking to other Tube stations.\n\nOxford Circus station \u2013 Bond Street station: Head west along Oxford Street from the road junction. You should see the London College of Fashion and BHS. Keep walking west and you will come to Bond Street station. Approximate walking time: 10 minutes.\nOxford Circus station \u2013 Tottenham Court Road station: At the road junction, head east along Oxford Street heading past Topshop. Keep walking past H&M and McDonald's and you will eventually see a skyscraper called Centre Point. Continue heading straight and Tottenham Court Road station is on the road junction here. Approximate walking time: 25 minutes.\nOxford Circus \u2013 Piccadilly Circus station: At the road junction, head south along Regent Street to pass many big name brands, including Apple and Hamleys. Just after the road curves round to the left, you should be at Piccadilly Circus. Approximate walking time: 10 minutes.\n\n\n=== By bicycle ===\n\nDue to the expense of other forms of transport and the compactness of central London, cycling is a tempting option. Free cycle maps can usually be obtained from your local Tube station or bike shop.\nMost major roads in London will have a bus lane which is restricted to buses, taxis and bicycles. There are also many signposted cycle routes and cycle lanes, but the kind of contiguous cycle lane network found in many other European cities does not exist. The safest option is to stick to minor residential roads where traffic can be surprisingly calm outside rush hours.\nCritical Mass London is a cycling advocacy group which meets for regular rides through central London at 6PM on the last Friday of each month. Rides start from the southern end of Waterloo Bridge. The London Cycling Campaign is an advocacy group for London cyclists. With active local groups in most of the city's boroughs, it is recognised by the local and regional governments as the leading voice for cycling in the capital.\nNormally a cyclist should keep to the left of the lane when cycling on a road with traffic, to allow faster-moving traffic to overtake. However, it is legal for a cycle to dominate a lane by maintaining a central road position like any other vehicle. This will make you unpopular with any traffic behind you but it is recommended in London on approach to right-hand turns at junctions. Making a right-hand turn from the normal left-position means crossing the lane of traffic, which may often ignore you and any turn signals you might have been using, leading to potential accidents.\n\n\n==== Taking bikes on trains ====\nPermission to take bikes on trains is very limited in London due to overcrowding. Non-folding bikes can be taken only on limited sections of the Tube network, mostly only on the above-ground sections outside peak hours. For this reason, folding bicycles are becoming increasingly popular. Most National Rail operators allow bicycles outside peak hours.\n\n\n==== Bicycle hire ====\nLondon offers a bicycle hire scheme known as Santander Cycles, operated by Transport for London. They are colloquially referred to as \"Boris Bikes\" after Boris Johnson, as they were introduced during his period as mayor of London. Docking stations can be found across Central London and slightly further out into areas such as Brixton, the Docklands, Hammersmith, and the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.\nThe bikes, all coloured a distinctive red, can be unlocked at any hire dock and then ridden to wherever you want. After each journey the bike must be returned to a docking station on the network by locking the bike into the rack and receiving confirmation via a green light.\nYou pay via a credit or debit card and two payment plans exist: daily and yearly. A \u00a32 daily plan (as of October 2020) gives access to the system for an unlimited number of rides for 24 hours. A fee for the first 30 minutes of each ride is included in the initial payment. For every other 30 minutes above that it costs extra \u00a32. A yearly plan costs \u00a390 for a full year.\nThe Santander Cycles app shows where bikes are available and can be used to make the hiring process faster, although sometimes the app doesn't show a journey as finished even if the bike was successfully docked back at a station. If in doubt it's better to check your activity log on the official site.\nThe Santander bikes' main competitor is Lime, whose fleet of electric bikes can be parked almost anywhere in much of Inner London, not just at docking stations. Download the app and set up a payment method first, then use your phone to scan a bike and unlock it. Rides are \u00a31 plus \u00a30.15 per minute (February 2021).\n\n\n==== Cycle ways ====\nCycle lanes provide on-road and off -road routes. The network is not comprehensive, and on the road lanes vary in quality and size (normally 1-2 m wide). Some are indicated just with a stencilled image of a bike on the road. If the line between the traffic lane and cycle lane is solid, then vehicles may sometimes enter the space. A dashed line indicates a recommended cycle lane and motorists may make use of this road space, but it's recommended that they don't.\nLondon's cycleways connect destinations across the capital, and include \"cycle superhighways\" and \"quietways\". Cycle Superhighways run into central London from outer London and across the capital. They are designed to provide safe, fast routes for cyclists who commute and are painted blue to indicate where they are. Some are segregated from the road but some may be on the main carriageway. Quietways link key destinations in the capital but utilise side streets, waterways and parks instead of busy roads.\nThe towpaths in north London along the Grand Union Canal and Regent's Canal, and in London's parks and other green areas, provide a traffic-free cycle path through the capital. The Grand Union canal connects Paddington to Camden and the Regent's Canal connects Camden to Islington, Mile End and Limehouse in east London. It takes about 30-40 minutes to cycle from Paddington station to Islington along the towpaths. Pedestrians have priority on towpaths - slow down and respect their right of the way!\n\n\n=== By taxi ===\n\nLondon has two types of taxis: the famous black cab, and so-called minicabs. Black cabs are the only ones licensed to \"ply for hire\" (i.e. pick people up off the street), while minicabs are more accurately described as \"private hire vehicles\" and need to be pre-booked.\nThe famous black cab of London (not always black!) can be hailed from the kerb or found at one of the many designated taxi ranks. It is possible to book black cabs by phone, for a fee, but if you are in central London it will usually be quicker to hail one from the street. Their amber TAXI light will be on if they are available. Drivers must pass a rigorous exam of central London's streets, known as 'The Knowledge', to be licensed to drive a black cab. This means they can supposedly navigate you to almost any London street without reference to a map. They are a cheap transport option if there are five passengers as they do not charge extras, and many view them as an essential experience for any visitor to London. Black cabs charge by distance and by the minute, are non-smoking, and have a minimum charge of \u00a33.00 (as of 2019). Tipping is not mandatory in either taxis or minicabs, despite some drivers' expectations - use your discretion. If you like the service you may tip. If the ride has been uncomfortable or unsafe, or if the driver was rude, don't. Most Londoners will simply round up to the nearest pound.\nTaxis are required by law to take you wherever you choose (within Greater London) if their TAXI light is on when you hail them. However some, especially older drivers, dislike leaving the centre of town, or going south of the River Thames. A good way to combat being left at the side of the curb is to open the back door, or even get into the cab, before stating your destination.\nMinicabs are normal cars which are licensed hire vehicles that you need to book by phone or at a minicab office. They generally charge a fixed fare for a journey, best agreed before you get in the car. Minicabs are usually cheaper than black cabs, although this is not necessarily the case for short journeys. Licensed minicabs display a Transport For London (TfL) Licence - usually in the front window. One of the features of the license plate is a blue version of the famous London Transport \"roundel\". A list of licensed minicab operators can be found at TfL Cabwise.\nTfL operate a service called Cabwise, which will determine your location and provide three local, licensed cab numbers. If you have an iPhone or an Android smartphone, you can use the Cabwise application (search your platform's app store) or text CAB to 60835 (be careful - this might not work from some phones!) You can also use an app such as mytaxi, which allows you to summon a black cab to your location and will provide a map and approximate wait time for your taxi to arrive. Most railway stations will also be able to provide a list of good local cab firms (many will display this outside the station, even after the last train of the night has gone.)\nSome areas in London are poorly served by black cabs, particularly late at night. This has led to illegal minicabs operating, who are just opportunistic people with a car, looking to make some \"fast\" money.  Some of these illegal operators can be fairly aggressive in their attempts to find customers, and it's now barely possible to walk late at night through any part of London with a modicum of night-life without being approached. If you've booked a \"licensed\" minicab to collect you from a venue, the driver or operator should be able to give you additional details, (an example being the phone-number you booked them from), to confirm they are legitimate.\nYou should avoid minicabs touting for business off the street and either take a black cab, book a licensed minicab by telephone, or take a night bus. Not only is it 'illegal' for unlicensed minicabs to ply for trade on the street, these illegal cabs are also regularly unsafe, with a risk of robbery or assault  a possibility, given that the operators of such illegal minicabs are in no way checked or vetted for past offences.\nAlways remember: if it's not licensed and it's not pre-booked, it's just a stranger's car. Never get into an un-booked minicab.\nUber is available in London and generally charge cheaper fares than black cabs, although higher \"surge\" prices are charged at times of high demand. Vehicles can only be booked via the smartphone app.\n\n\n=== By car ===\nLondoners who drive will normally take public transport in the centre; follow their example. Unless you have a disability, there is no good reason whatsoever to drive a car in central London. Driving in central London is a slow, frustrating, expensive and often unnecessary activity. There are many sorts of automatic enforcement cameras and it is difficult and expensive to park.\nDriving outside of central London is easier, but traffic can still be an issue and most tourists won't head out that far unless they have a reason.\nFor those with disabilities driving can be much more convenient than using public transport. If disabled and a resident of a member state of the EU then two cars can be permanently registered, for free, for the Congestion Charge.\nThere's a speed limit of 20 mph (32 km/h) on most roads inside the Central London Congestion Charge zone, and several boroughs have borough-wide 20 limits. Limits elsewhere follow UK norms; see Driving in the United Kingdom#Speed limits for details.\n\n\n==== Congestion Charge ====\nDriving into central London on weekdays during daylight hours incurs a hefty charge called the Congestion Charge with very few exemptions. Rental cars also attract the charge. Cameras and mobile units record and identify the number plates and registration details of all vehicles entering the charging zone with high accuracy. The Central London Congestion Charge M-F 7AM-6PM (excluding public holidays) attracts a fee of \u00a315. Numerous payment options exist: by phone, online, at convenience stores displaying the red 'C' logo in the window, and by voucher. Failure to pay the charge by midnight the next charging day incurs a hefty automatic fine of \u00a3160 (\u00a380 if paid within 2 weeks). There are additional charges and penalties for vehicles not meeting certain emissions standards.\n\n\n==== Traffic ====\nDespite the Congestion Charge, London - like most major cities - continues to experience traffic snarls. These are, of course, worse on weekdays during peak commuting hours (i.e. :30-9:30AM and 4-7PM). At these times public transport (and especially the Tube) usually offers the best alternative for speed and reduced hassle.\n\n\n==== Parking ====\nOne good tip is, that outside advertised restricted hours (usually on a Sunday), parking on a single yellow line is permissible. Parking on a red line or a double yellow line is never permissible and heavily enforced. Find and read the parking restrictions carefully! Parking during weekdays and on Saturday can also mean considerable expense in parking fees (fees and restrictions are ignored at your extreme financial peril). Issuing fines, clamping and/or towing vehicles (without warning!) has become a veritable new industry for borough councils staffed by armies of traffic wardens.\nAlso watch out for marked parking bays as these always have restrictions. Many are \"Resident Parking Only\" between certain hours and you will be fined if you park during these hours without a permit. Some bays also have restrictions on how long you can park in them for and these can be confusing. If in doubt: Don't park!\nIf you are driving to your destination then it's safest to find a dedicated private car park nearby. These may be eye-wateringly expensive, but parking on the roads is a lottery with low odds of you winning. Two large car park operators are NCP and Q-Park.\n\n\n==== Motorcycles and scooters ====\nMotorcycles and scooters are fairly common in London as they can pass stationary cars, can usually be parked for free, and are exempt from the Congestion Charge. Scooters and bikes with automatic transmission are much more preferable - a manually-geared racing bike is completely impractical unless you have excellent clutch control (although it has to be said you will see plenty of them being ridden aggressively by motorcycle couriers and locals as it can be the fastest way to get around!) Likewise to bicycles, car drivers can sometimes show disregard to anyone on two wheels and larger vehicles have an unwritten priority so take care when crossing junctions. Helmets are mandatory. Parking for bikes is usually free - there are designated motorcycle-parking areas on some side-streets and some multi-level car parks will have bike parking on the ground level.\n\n\n=== By boat ===\n\nLondon is now promoting a network of river bus and pleasure cruise services along the River Thames from Hampton Court in the west to Woolwich Arsenal in the east. London River Services (part of Transport for London) manages regular commuter boats and a network of piers all along the river and publishes timetables and river maps similar to the famous Tube map. While boat travel may be slower and a little more expensive than Tube travel, it offers an extremely pleasant way to cross the city with unrivalled views of the London skyline. Sailing under Tower Bridge is an unforgettable experience.\nBoats are operated by private companies and they have a separate ticketing system from the rest of London transport; however if you have a Travelcard you get a 33% discount on most boat tickets. Many boat operators offer their own one-day ticket - ask at the pier kiosks. Generally, tickets from one boat company are not valid on other operators' services. Oyster cards can be used as payment for the 'Clipper'-styled commuter services but not for tour boats.\n\nAll the central London sights in Westminster and the South Bank tourist attractions are easily accessible by boat as are:\n\nConsider a trip along an old Victorian canal through the leafy suburbs of North London. The London Waterbus Company runs scheduled services (more in summer, fewer in winter) from Little Venice to Camden Lock with a stop at the London Zoo (pick up only). The 45-minute trip along Regent's Canal is a delightful way to travel.\n\n\n=== By skate ===\nInline skating on roads and pavements (sidewalks) is completely legal, except in the \"square-mile\" of the City of London. Roads are not the greatest but easily skateable. Central London drivers are more used to skaters than those in the outskirts.\n\n\n=== By cable car ===\nThe London cable car (branded for sponsorship reasons as IFS Cloud Cable Car; formerly Emirates Air Line) is a cable car that runs across the River Thames in east London giving panoramic views of the surrounding area and beyond. It connects the Greenwich Peninsula on the south bank (near The O2) and the Royal Docks on the north bank (near the ExCeL Exhibition Centre), with the Greenwich Peninsula terminal connecting to North Greenwich Tube station on the Jubilee line and the Royal Docks terminal connecting to Royal Victoria DLR station.\nAlthough it is part of the TfL network and uses Oyster cards, the London cable car is mostly a tourist attraction for many and is therefore at its quietest during the week. It tends to be busiest when there is a large event at the ExCeL Exhibition Centre or a popular concert at The O2.\nThe cable car service sometimes finishes earlier than the Tube and DLR. If you are travelling to The O2 for an event that finishes late, you should have an alternative means in mind for getting back across the river.\n\n\n==== Operating hours ====\n\n\n== See ==\n\nLondon is a huge city, so all individual listings are in the appropriate district articles and only an overview is presented here.\n\n\n=== Landmarks ===\n\nBuckingham Palace. The London residence of the King, in Westminster. Open for tours during the summer months only (in 2022 - from Jul 22 to Sep 30; tickets - https://tickets.rct.uk/product/date), but a must-see sight even if you don't go in. (Tube: Green Park). Changing of the Guard spans three locations: Buckingham Palace, St James\u2019s Palace and Wellington Barracks, and usually begins at 10:43 (check https://changing-guard.com/dates-buckingham-palace.html for details).\nLondon Eye. The world's fourth-largest observation wheel, on the South Bank of the Thames with magnificent views over London. (Tube: Waterloo)\nMarble Arch is a white Carrara marble monument designed by John Nash. It is located in the middle of a huge traffic island at one of the busiest intersections in central London where Oxford Street meets Park Lane in Mayfair. (Tube: Marble Arch)\nPiccadilly Circus is one of the most photographed sights in London. The Shaftesbury Memorial, topped by the statue of Anteros (now popularly identified as Eros), stands proudly in the middle of Piccadilly Circus while the north eastern side is dominated by a huge, iconic neon advertising hoarding. Occasionally there will be scaffolding or fencing around the Eros statue in order to protect it during times when large crowds are anticipated. (Tube: Piccadilly Circus)\n\nSt Paul's Cathedral, also in the City, is Sir Christopher Wren's great accomplishment, built after the 1666 Great Fire of London - the great dome is still seated in majesty over the City. A section of the dome has such good acoustics that it forms a \"Whispering Gallery\". There is also a viewing area that offers views of the surrounding area including the Millennium Bridge that lies nearby. (Tube: St Paul's)\n\nTower Bridge. The iconic 19th century bridge located by the Tower of London near the City. It is decorated with high towers featuring a drawbridge. The public are allowed access to the interior of the bridge via the Tower Bridge Exhibition, tickets for which can be purchased online or at the bridge. (Tube: Tower Hill)\nTower of London. Situated just south east of the City, is London's original royal fortress by the Thames. It is over 900 years old, contains the Crown Jewels, is guarded by Beefeaters, and is a World Heritage site. It is also considered by many to be the most haunted building in the world. If you are interested in that sort of thing its definitely somewhere worth visiting. Sometimes there are guided ghost walks of the building. You can even have a good meal in one of the buildings on the property. (Tube: Tower Hill)\nTrafalgar Square. Home of Nelson's Column and the lions, and once a safe haven for London's pigeons until the introduction of hired birds of prey. The \"Fourth Plinth\" has featured a succession of artworks since 1999. Overlooked by the National Gallery, it's the nearest London has to a \"centre\", and has been pedestrianised. (Tube: Charing Cross)\nWestminster Abbey and the Palace of Westminster, including the Elizabeth Tower (the clock tower commonly known by the name of its bell, Big Ben) and the Houses of Parliament, in Westminster. The seat of the United Kingdom parliament and World Heritage site, as well as setting for royal coronations since 1066, including Queen Elizabeth II in 1953. The Palace of Westminster is open to the public only for viewing parliamentary debates, tours of the building are available in July \u2013 August when Parliament is away on summer recess. Westminster Abbey also has a restaurant and a caf\u00e9 that both serve good food. (Tube: Westminster)\n30 St Mary Axe or The Gherkin, a peculiarly-shaped 180 m (590 ft) building in the City. There is no public access to the building itself but it can be viewed from the roads and small paved areas directly in front of and behind the building. Security guards can be overzealous in this area and you may be asked to move on or stop taking photographs if you are doing so (although this may seem overbearing, it is private land and they can ask you to leave if they wish). Commanding views of this building can also be obtained from public roads near the site such as Leadenhall Street. Of minor interest to history fans is an inscription on Bury Street dedicated to a young Roman girl who was found buried here by archaeologists in 1995. Her remains were moved to the Museum of London while the Gherkin was being constructed, and were reburied in 2007 at the original site. (Tube: Aldgate)\nThe Shard. A futuristic triangular skyscraper in South Bank that dominates the London skyline and is the tallest building in the UK. There is a viewing deck on the 72nd floor that is open to the public, tickets for which must be booked via the website. There are also restaurants and the expensive luxury hotel Shangri-La on the lower floors. (Tube: London Bridge)\nThe Walkie-Talkie / 20 Fenchurch Street, although it has been voted as one of London's ugliest skyscrapers, has a large rooftop garden which affords great views over the Thames and south side of the river. This garden is free to visit, however, it is necessary to book well in advance due to high demand, especially in the summer months. (Tube: Monument)\n\n\n=== Museums and galleries ===\n\nCentral London hosts an outstanding collection of world-class museums and galleries, several of truly iconic status.\nEven better, London is unique among global capitals in that the majority of the museums have no entrance charges, allowing visitors to make multiple visits with ease. Special or temporary exhibitions usually attract an admission charge.\nLondon museums and galleries with no general admission charge (free entry!) include:\n\nBritish Museum (Tube: Holborn)\u2014a treasure trove of world cultures from across the ages, on par with the Paris Louvre and New York's Metropolitan Museum\nNational Gallery (Tube: Charing Cross)\u2014houses the national collection of paintings in the Western European tradition from the 13th to the 19th centuries\nNational Portrait Gallery (Tube: Charing Cross)\nVictoria and Albert Museum (Tube: South Kensington)\nNatural History Museum (Tube: South Kensington)\nScience Museum (Tube: South Kensington)\nTate Modern (Tube: Southwark, Blackfriars)\nTate Britain (Tube: Pimlico)\nWallace Collection (Tube: Marble Arch)\nAside from these world famous establishments, there is an almost unbelievable number of minor museums in London covering a very diverse range of subjects. The British Government lists over 240 genuine museums in the city. A few notable examples:\n\nLondon Transport Museum (Tube: Covent Garden)\nMuseum of London (Tube: Barbican or St. Paul's)\nMuseum of London Docklands (DLR: West India Quay)\nThe Royal Museums Greenwich: (DLR: Cutty Sark)\nRoyal Observatory\nNational Maritime Museum\nCutty Sark\n\n\n=== Parks ===\n\nThe \"green lungs\" of London are the many parks, great and small, scattered throughout the city including Hyde Park, St James Park and Regent's Park. Most of the larger parks have their origins in royal estates and hunting grounds and are still owned by the Crown, despite their public access.\n\nHyde Park and adjoining Kensington Gardens make up a huge open space in central London and are very popular for picnics. Within Kensington Gardens, the Diana, Princess of Wales, Memorial Playground is a free playground for young children featuring a huge wood pirate ship. (Tube: High Street Kensington, Marble Arch, Green Park or Hyde Park Corner)\nRegent's Park is a wonderful open park in the northern part of central London. On the northern edge is London Zoo. (Tube: Camden Town, Regent's Park)\nSt James's Park has charming and romantic gardens ideal for picnics and for strolling around. St. James's Park is situated between Buckingham Palace on the west and Horse Guards Parade on the east.\nHampstead Heath is a huge open green space in north London. It's not a tended park as such and is remarkably wild for a metropolitan city location. The views from the Parliament Hill area of the heath overlooking the city skyline are quite stunning. (Tube: Hampstead, Overground: Hampstead Heath, Gospel Oak)\nBattersea Park is a public park in the London Borough of Wandsworth, on the south bank of the Thames, and contains a Japanese pagoda.\nRichmond Park is a huge green space, with a thriving deer population. Excellent place for cycling. (Tube: Richmond then Bus 65 or 371)\nBushy Park, near to Hampton Court Palace, is the second-largest park in London. More low-key than its larger cousin, Richmond Park, it too has a large deer population. Bushy Park contains numerous ponds, bridleways, two allotments, and at its northern edge, the National Physical Laboratory.\nHolland Park is a public park in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, in west London. It covers about 22 hectares and contains two Japanese gardens - the Kyoto Garden (1991) and Fukushima Memorial Garden (2012), a youth hostel, a children's playground, squirrels and peacocks. The closest Tube station is Holland Park on the Central line.\n\n\n=== Itineraries ===\nLondon South Bank Walk\nWalk the London Wall\nFor a selection of walks across London, look at London on foot.\n\n\n=== Blue Plaques ===\nEnglish Heritage runs the Blue Plaques programme in London. Blue Plaques celebrate great figures of the past and the buildings that they inhabited. These are among the most familiar features of the capital\u2019s streetscape and adorn the fa\u00e7ades of buildings across the city. Since the first plaque was erected in 1867, the number has grown steadily and there are now more than 800. Recipients are as diverse as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Sigmund Freud, Charles de Gaulle, Jimi Hendrix and Karl Marx. Look out for these around the city.\n\n\n=== London Pass ===\nWhereas some London museums offer free entry, some other top London attractions are ridiculously expensive. For example, entry to Westminster Abbey costs \u00a320 per person (adult), and entry to the Tower is \u00a321.50 per adult if bought online (2017). These prices can be sometimes mitigated by a purchase of London Pass, which needs to be done at the London Pass website. The pass comes in several varieties and gives access to over 60 attractions, including both Westminster Abbey and the Tower. For example, a day pass costs \u00a362 for an adult (2017). The best strategy, if one wants to visit several expensive high-profile attractions, is to buy a day pass and to try visiting all of them in the same day. This requires some advanced planning and will not give you much time at each place you visit - for example, it can take an hour on public transport to travel between the Tower of London and London Zoo.\n\n\n== Do ==\nLondon is a huge city, so all individual listings are in the appropriate district articles. To make the most of the city's tremendous cultural offerings (performing arts, museums, exhibitions, clubs, eateries and numerous others), visitors will do well to pick up a copy of a cultural magazine like Time Out London (available at most corner shops and newsagents) which gives detailed information and critiques on what's around town including show times and current attractions. The Time Out London website also has major shows listed. There is also apps available, although the print version tends to be more detailed.\n\n\n=== Live music ===\nLondon is one of the best cities in the world for concerts, spanning from new musical trends to well-known bands. Between huge concert facilities and small pubs, there are hundreds of venues that organise and promote live music every week. Many concerts, especially in smaller or less known places are free, so there is plenty of choice even for tourists on a budget.\nLondon has long been a launchpad for alternative movements, from the mods of the 1960s, punks of the 70s, new romantics of the 80s, the Britpop scene of the 90s, and the indie rock and rock movements in the 21st century. It has one of the world's most lively live music scenes: any band heading a British, European or World tour will play London, not to mention the local talent. London's music scene is incredibly diverse, covering all genres of music from electro-jazz to death-metal, and all sizes of bands, from the U2s and Rolling Stones of the world to bands that disband after their first gig. This diversity is reflected in prices. As a rough guide: \u00a340 and up for 'top 40' bands in arena-sized venues, \u00a320 and up for established bands in mid-sized venues, \u00a310 or more for up-and-coming bands and club nights in smaller venues, \u00a35 and up for new bands in bars and pubs (as of 2024).\nLondon has hundreds of venues spread out over the city and the best way to know what's going on where is to browse online ticket agencies, Music Magazine's gig directories and bands' social media pages. A few areas which have higher concentrations of pubs and venues than others. Kilburn in North West London has long been known as an Irish area; though their numbers have somewhat declined, a visit to a local pub will show their influence remains today.\n\n\n=== Theatre ===\nThe West End, especially the areas concentrated around Leicester Square, Covent Garden, Shaftesbury Avenue and Haymarket, is one of the world's premier destinations for theatre, including musical theatre.  In the centre of Leicester Square there is an official half-price TKTS booth. Be wary of other ticket offices -including those claiming to be the \"Official Half-Price Ticket Office\" - as these may have higher prices, and have been known to sell fake tickets. For up-to-date listings see the weekly magazine Time Out or check the Official London Theatre site.\nThe South Bank is another area well known for world class theatre, and is home to the National Theatre and the Globe Theatre, the latter of which is London's only thatched building and an attraction in itself. Each Globe performance has over 700 \u00a35 tickets. \nLondon's theatre scene outside of these two main districts is known as \"the Fringe\". Several of the larger and more established fringe theatres are an excellent way to see top quality productions of plays that may move to the West End, but at lower than West End prices. The Royal Court theatre specialises in new work by innovative writers from the UK and around the world. The Menier Chocolate Factory has done spectacularly well with revivals of musicals. [[London/Hammersmith and Fulham#Q12061418|The Lyric Theatre], Hammersmith, offers a mix of modern interpretations of Shakespeare, musicals, and plays serving the Asian and Afro-Caribbean populations of West London.\n\n\n=== Other things to do ===\n\nTake a walk through London's Royal Parks. A good walk would start at Paddington station, and head through Kensington Gardens, Hyde Park, Green Park (passing Buckingham Palace) and St James's Park before crossing Trafalgar Square and the River Thames to the South Bank and Waterloo station. At a strolling pace this walk would take half a day, with plenty of places to stop, sit, drink, and eat en route.\nWatch a film: As well as the world-famous blockbuster cinemas in the West End, London has a large number of superb art house cinemas. In the summer months, there are often outdoor screenings at various venues, such as Somerset House and in some of the large parks.\nWatch football: London has over a dozen professional football clubs, plus Wembley Stadium, the national stadium of England, hosting internationals (including World Cup and European Championships qualifiers) and the finals of club competitions, notably the FA Cup and the League Cup. As of 2024, London has six clubs in the Premier League, the top tier of English football: Arsenal, Chelsea, Crystal Palace, Brentford, Tottenham Hotspur (Spurs), Fulham, and West Ham United. In the second tier, the Championship, are Millwall and Queens Park Rangers (QPR). In the third tier, League One, are Charlton Athletic and Leyton Orient; and in the fourth tier, League Two, are AFC Wimbledon and Sutton United. Other clubs slug it out in the lower leagues, semi-professional going on amateur. International and top club matches need booking in advance, and at clubs like Arsenal and Chelsea, its nearly impossible to get tickets without some sort of club membership or through a shady third party website or a scalper, which are both best avoided as the tickets probably aren't even valid. However, at smaller clubs you can just turn up and pay at the gate. At bottom-end clubs there's actually a risk that you might be begged to strip off and take the field to make up an eleven. Hackney & Walthamstow marshes have football teams and playing fields the way Xanadu had caverns measureless to man, with a thin drizzle blowing in off a sunless sea.\nWatch rugby union, 15-a-side. Internationals are played at Twickenham west of the city - the Six Nations games are likely to sell out. Three London teams play in the Premiership, the top tier of club rugby in England: Harlequins, London Irish and Saracens. You'll see famous international players in these club fixtures.\nWatch tennis at Wimbledon: Wimbledon is the oldest tennis tournament in the world and is widely considered the most prestigious. Naturally it is a regular feature on the tennis calendar. London goes \"tennis crazy\" for two weeks when the competition commences in late June and early July. One of the greatest traditions of this event is to eat strawberries and cream with sugar. (Tube: Southfields)\nWatch cricket at the Oval (Lambeth) or Lord's (St Johns). Both host county and Test matches (i.e. internationals, lasting up to 5 days).\nLondon Open House Weekend: Explore many of the city's most interesting buildings during the London Open House Weekend, usually held on the third weekend of September. During this single weekend, several hundred buildings which are not normally open to the public are opened up. See website for details of buildings opening in any given year. Some buildings have to be booked in advance; book early for the popular ones.\nWinter skating. During the winter months multiple outdoor ice rinks pop up across London. Considered by some to be somewhat overpriced and overcrowded, they nonetheless have multiplied, easing congestion and increasing competition. Most charge from \u00a310-12 (adults) for an hour on the ice, including skate hire. See the district articles for the City of London, East End and Leicester Square.\nSummer skating. In summer (and also in winter, for the more dedicated) there is also a thriving roller skating (on inline and traditional \"quad\" skates) scene in London, catering to many disciplines including street hockey, freestyle slalom, dance, general recreational skating (including three weekly marshalled group street skates) and speed skating. This mostly centres around Hyde Park (on the Serpentine Road) and Kensington Gardens (by the Albert Memorial). See the district articles for Mayfair-Marylebone and South West London.\nBus and river tours: If you don't feel like splashing out on one of the commercial bus tours, you can make your own bus tour by buying an Oyster card and spending some time riding around London on the top deck of standard London buses. You don't get the open air or the commentary, but the views are very similar. You will likely get lost but that is half the fun; if that worries you  then go for a commercial tour, which will give you a 24-hour ticket to use the company's buses to see the essential sites of London and a boat tour on the Thames (with the same ticket) provides a river tour of some of metropolitan London. Commercial tours are also the only remaining way to ride a vintage red routemaster bus through the city streets.\nPhotography. Buildings such as museums, churches and art galleries will display their own guidelines clearly. In many public buildings the use of tripods and flash are not permitted.\nHidden London. A series of tours run by the London Transport Museum exploring the hidden depths of the Underground, including abandoned stations and tunnels; plus there are visits to TfL's famous art deco headquarters (55 Broadway) and \"access all areas\" inside looks at operational stations such as Charing Cross and Euston. Demand is high for what is quite a restricted annual programme, and you can purchase a maximum of four tickets per tour. Adults: \u00a341.50, concession: \u00a336.50. This ticket includes a day pass to the LT Museum, to be used within a month of the event date, and gives you a 10% discount on all merchandise bought at the museum shop or online within the same period.\nNFL International Series. NFL (American Football) games held in Wembley and Twickenham Stadiums. Usually held on Sunday evenings or afternoons between October and December of each year.\n\n\n== Learn ==\n\n\n=== Learn English ===\nLondon is a natural place to learn and improve spoken and written English. There are a huge range of options, from informal language exchange services to evening classes and formal language schools. There are unaccredited schools charging hefty fees and offering qualifications that are viewed as worthless. If choosing a course from a privately-run school or college, it is important to ensure the institution is accredited by the British Council.\nSome links to British Council accredited schools:\n\n Linguaenglish London. Lingua London is a family-run English language school and has been teaching English only courses in London for over 10 years. \n Rose of York, \u260f +44 20 7580-9888, hello@roseofyork.com. Rose of York has been teaching English language courses for over 28 years and they offer full-time, intensive or part-time English courses (updated Dec 2017)\n\n\n== Work ==\nLondon is one of the world's leading financial centres and so professional services is the main area of employment. It is best to check with recruiters and staffing agencies.\nLondon is hugely popular as a working holiday destination - work in bars and the hospitality industry is relatively easy to find.\nWages are generally higher in London than the rest of the UK, in part due to the addition of London weighting, although the cost of living is higher still.\n\n\n== Buy ==\n\n\n=== Money ===\nLondon, like the rest of the UK, uses the British pound sterling.\nRetail prices for most items, with a few exceptions, always include VAT (at 20%). Visa and MasterCard/Maestro are the two most commonly accepted debit/credit cards, although most large shops will also accept American Express. If your card does not have a microchip (for Chip & PIN) some machines (for instance, at Tube stations) will be unable to read your card. Some shops may ask you for additional identification, especially in relation to high-value items, or items that are under age-related restrictions. Most shops no longer accept personal cheques. Contactless or NFC-enabled Visa and MasterCard cards can also be used for purchases of usually up to \u00a3100 in lieu of Chip & Pin, even on London Underground fare gates and buses.\n\u00a350 notes are not often used in everyday transactions and most shops will not accept them. When exchanging money at a bureau de change make sure to ask for \u00a35, \u00a310 and \u00a320 notes only. The Bank of England's guide to bank notes may be of use.\nLondon and England are some of the worst places to exchange money. Included fees (in the exchange rate) of up to 50% are not uncommon. Do not get fooled by the no commission statement that many bureaux de change make. This is a trick and actually a blunt lie because the exchange rates are just made so bad so that they cover any necessary commissions. So, how do you identify a decent exchange rate? Basically, the spread between the buy and sell rate tells you what is the fee (divided by 2, actually)\u2014anything above 10% is a rip-off, 5% is good, 1% is excellent but forget about it in the UK. You are better off withdrawing money from ATMs here.\nNEVER attempt to change money on either Leicester Square or Tottenham Court Road; rates in either one of those places can be subject to \"interpretation\" by the individuals behind the counter.\n\n\n=== Shopping ===\nLondon has a justified reputation for being one of the world's most expensive cities. But if you do your homework beforehand, there are ways to limit the damage, and prices for basic items are in general not as exorbitant as in the Nordic countries or Switzerland.\n\nLondon is one of the world's most fashion-conscious cities: it has an abundance of clothing shops from the flagship stores of Oxford Street to the tiny boutiques of Brick Lane.\nThough not particularly known for bargain shopping, nearly anything you could possibly want to buy is available in London. During major sales, such as the annual Boxing Day sale after Christmas, and Black Friday in late November (an event imported from the U.S.), you price for some items are lowered by up to 70%, meaning that it is possible to find bargains for genuine luxury-branded goods if you are there at the right time. In Central London, the main shopping district is the West End (Bond Street, Covent Garden, Oxford Street and Regent Street). On Thursdays many West End stores close later than normal (7-8PM).\n\nOxford Street. Main shopping street, home to flagship branches of all the major British high street retailers in one go including Selfridges, John Lewis (includes a food hall), Marks & Spencer and other department stores. It is best to shop here in the morning as the street becomes increasingly busy during the day. (Tube: Oxford Circus)\nRegent Street (between Oxford Circus and Piccadilly Circus). Includes such gems as Hamleys, considered to be London's flagship toy store spread out on seven levels, the iconic luxury department store Liberty, and the London Apple Store. (Tube: Oxford Circus, Piccadilly Circus)\nBond Street. Some of the world's most luxurious designer stores such as Cartier, D&G, Jimmy Choo, Louis Vuitton and Versace. (Tube: Bond Street)\nTottenham Court Road. Contains some of the world's most luxurious designer interior stores such as Heals. (Tube: Tottenham Court Road, Goodge Street)\nCovent Garden. Fashionable area home to quaint outlets and relatively expensive designer stores. Around Seven Dials, chains include Adidas Originals, All Saints, Carhartt, Fred Perry, G Star Raw and Stussy. For shoes, head for Neal Street. Also found here is the London Transport Museum whose gift shop has some of the best souvenirs in the city (old maps, vintage Tube posters, etc.) London's second Apple Store is located here as well. (Tube: Covent Garden)\nCharing Cross Road (near Covent Garden). Traditionally a book lover's haven, it still has the giant general bookstore Foyles, and a few specialist and antiquarian shops survive south of Cambridge Circus and on the side streets to the east. (Tube: Tottenham Court Road, Leicester Square, or Charing Cross)\nPiccadilly (near Piccadilly Circus). Home to the luxury department store Fortnum & Mason.\nDenmark Street (at the north end of Charing Cross Road near Tottenham Court Road station). Also known as Tin-Pan Alley, this is a music lover's paradise with an amazing array of music shops, bars and clubs in one short street. (Tube: Tottenham Court Road)\nSoho. Offers alternative music and clothes. Now home to Chappell of Bond Street's historic music shop. (Tube: Oxford Circus)\nCamden Town. Alternative clothing and other alternative shopping, popular with teenagers and young adults. Has the headquarters for Cyberdog - a large shop which sells clothing and accessories for the club and rave scene. Camden Lock Market is also worth a visit to see independent artists plying their wares. (Tube: Camden Town)\nChelsea. The King's Road is noted for fashion, homeware and children's clothing. On Wednesday many stores close late. (Tube: South Kensington)\nKnightsbridge. Department stores include the world-famous Harrods (includes a food hall) and Harvey Nichols. On Wednesday many stores close late. (Tube: Knightsbridge)\nBeauchamp Place. Shop where royalty and celebrities shop! One of the world's most unique and famous streets. It is known as one of London\u2019s most fashionable and distinctive streets, housing some of the best known names in London fashion, interspersed with trendy restaurants, jewellers and speciality shops including Fortuny. (Tube: Knightsbridge)\nWestminster. Some of the world's most famous shirts are made on Jermyn Street. Savile Row is home to some of the world's best men's bespoke tailors including Henry Poole, Gieves & Hawkes, H. Huntsman & Sons, and Dege & Skinner. (Tube: Westminster)\nWestfield London in Shepherd's Bush is one of the two largest shopping mall complexes in Greater London. It is served by the London Overground and the Underground. It is easiest to get here via public transport, but there is reasonable car parking space available. (Tube: Shepherd's Bush)\nWestfield Stratford City in Stratford is a large shopping mall complex located on the edge of the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. There is ample car parking and you can also park here to access the park. This Westfield is easier to access by car due to its close proximity to the A12 road. (Tube/DLR: Stratford)\n\n\n=== Markets ===\nBorough Market is a great (if expensive) food market, offering fruit, vegetables, cheese, bread, meat, fish, and so on, much of it organic. The market opens Th-Sa. Many stalls offer freshly made fast food on the spot for lunch; from ostrich burgers to falafel, most tastes are catered for. (Tube: London Bridge)\nOld Spitalfields Market is an excellent market for clothes from up-and-coming designers, records, housewares, food, and all things trendy. (Tube: Liverpool Street)\nAlso be sure to check out Brick Lane Market, Greenwich Market and Portobello Road Market.\n\n\n=== Tax-free ===\nTax-free shops in airports are not strong in variety, prices are equal to London, and they close rather early as well. Shop listings at airport web sites can help to plan your tax-free (vs traditional) shopping. In the evening allow an extra half hour as closing hours are not always strictly respected.\nNevertheless, tax-free (at the airport) does not mean cheaper. Prices are determined by the shop owner at their own discretion, and due to the large crowds, high shop rents, and free marketing there is no real reason why anyone should offer prices below average. Also, often goods sold here have different sizes than in regular stores, making it harder to compare. Furthermore, tax-free shops mostly only offer expensive brands and no cheap non-brand stuff, like simple sun glasses. Either way, you are better off doing your shopping somewhere else.\nNevertheless, a different matter is tax reclaim. Many big department stores in central London have an information booth where they can give you the paperwork needed to reclaim tax on purchases made at the store when you get to the airport.\n\n\n== Eat ==\nFor suggestions of specific restaurants have a look into the district articles.\n\nIt is a huge task for a visitor to find the \"right place\" to eat in London - with the \"right atmosphere\", at the \"right price\" - largely because, as in any big city, there are literally thousands of venues from which to choose, ranging from fast food joints, pubs, and mainstream chains all the way up to some of the most exclusive restaurants in the world which attract the kind of clientele that don't need to ask the price. Sorting the good from the bad isn't easy, but London has something to accommodate all budgets and tastes. As London is one of the world's most multicultural cities, it is possible to find virtually every cuisine from around the world here if you look hard enough.\nFollowing is a rough guide to what you might get, should you fancy eating out:\n\nUp to \u00a36 - you can get a good English pub or cafeteria breakfast with a rack of bacon, beans in tomato sauce, egg, sausage, orange juice and coffee or tea. Most pubs stop this offer at 11AM, but there are literally hundreds of backstreet cafes (colloquially known as \"greasy spoons\") which will serve this sort of food all day. Most supermarket chains offer a \"meal deal\", consisting of a sandwich, a drink and a bag of crisps or fruit for \u00a33-4 together, while buying the sandwich only can be the same price. If you are going to be on a budget for several days, the supermarkets are a good option.\n\u00a38 - will buy you a couple of sandwiches and a soft drink, some takeaway fish and chips, or a fast food meal. There are also mostly Chinese restaurants which serve an all-you-can-eat buffet for around this price. These are dotted about the West End and it is well worth asking a member of public or a shopkeeper where the nearest one is. These restaurants make much of their revenue on drinks although these are usually still moderately priced. The food while not being of the finest standard is usually very tasty and the range of dishes available is excellent. There are literally thousands of so-called takeaways in London and are a cheap alternative to a restaurant meal. Check with your hotel management if they allow food deliveries before ordering in. Most takeaways offer some form of seating, but this is usually very limited.\n\u00a36-10 - will get you a good pub meal and drink or a good Chinese/Indian/Italian/Thai/Vietnamese buffet. Many pubs have a buy-one-get-one-free offer, and you can either order two main dishes for yourself or bring a friend.\n\u00a315 - some more expensive French, Mediterranean and international restaurants do cheaper two or three course lunch menus.\n\u00a325 - offers you a lot more choice. You can have a good meal, half a bottle of wine and change for the tube home. There are plenty of modest restaurants that cater for this bracket.\n\u00a350 (to almost any amount!) - with more money to spend you can pick some of the city's finer restaurants. It may be a famous chef (like Michel Roux, Jr, or Gordon Ramsay) or simply a place that prides itself on using the finest ingredients. Worth the splurge to impress a special someone. These establishments often need to be booked well in advance, and most will enforce a dress code of some sort, like Rules of Covent Garden, the oldest restaurant still extant.\nPrices inevitably become inflated at venues closest to major tourist attractions - beware the so-called tourist traps. The worst tourist trap food, in the opinion of many Londoners, is served at the various steak houses (Angus Steak House, Aberdeen Steak House, etc. - they are all dotted around the West End and near the main train stations). Londoners wouldn't dream of eating here - you shouldn't either! Notorious areas for inflated menu prices trading on travellers' gullibility and lack of knowledge are the streets around the British Museum, Leicester Square and Piccadilly Circus. Even the major fast food chains charge a premium in their West End outlets - so watch out.\nPubs in the touristy areas of London are usually a poor choice for food although there are some brilliant \"gastro-pubs\" hidden away. In general, avoid all pubs that have graphic-designed and printed menus. Look around you - see any locals tucking in? No? - then you shouldn't either. The other rule to follow when avoiding poor food is the same as in any other part of Europe - is the menu available in multiple languages? If yes then start running!\n\nIn the suburbs, the cost of eating out is reduced drastically. Particularly in large ethnic communities, there is a competitive market which stands to benefit the consumer. In East London for example, the vast number of chicken shops means that a deal for 2 pieces of chicken, chips (fries) and a drink shouldn't cost you more than \u00a33 especially on Brick Lane. Brick Lane is also known for being home to London's version of the beigel (spelt \"bagel\" in the United States and Canada, but pronounced the same way), with Brick Lane Beigel Bake and Britain's First & Best Beigel Shop being among the sole remnants of what was once a thriving Jewish community in the neighbourhood. Both shops are also known for their salt beef, London's version of Jewish-style cured meats, and a popular filling in their beigel sandwiches. Another good (and cheap) lunch option is a chicken or lamb doner (gyro) at many outlets throughout the city, though meat quality is often poor.\nFor more authentic Cockney food, try pie and mash, which originates from the working-class in the East End. Usually minced beef and cold water pastry pie served with mashed potato, mushy peas and \"liquor\" gravy, it tastes a lot better than it sounds. Some of the best pie houses are M. Manze in Peckham or F. Cooke in Hackney Broadway Market. Water Souchet and London Particular (green-pea and ham) are classic Cockney soups, though hard to find on menus. For those game, jellied eels, pickled-cockles and whelks are all traditional London seafood. It's people's experiences in these kind of places that gives Britain a bad name for food!\nThe South Bank's Borough Market offers wholesale produce as well as individual stalls that sell small bites and drinks for a casual and cheap meal. Kappacasein Dairy has a popular stand in the market famous for their grilled cheese which has earned the praise of Giada De Laurentiis and Ruth Reichl.\nOf course, the quintessential British dish fish and chips is widely available in London, but the standards can be pretty disappointing in the tourist trap pubs. The best-rated fish and chips shops in London are generally located in the suburbs, away from all the tourist fare in central London.\nFor hamburgers, local chain Burger & Lobster is an excellent choice for gourmet burgers.\nTipping may also be different than what you're used to. All meals include the 20% VAT tax and some places include a service fee (10-12%). The general rule is to leave a tip for table service, unless there's already a service charge added or unless the service has been notably poor. The amount tipped is generally in the region of 10%, but if there's a figure between 10-15% which would leave the bill at a conveniently round total, many would consider it polite to tip this amount. Tipping for counter service, or any other form of service, is unusual - but some choose to do so if a tips container is provided.\n\n\n=== Restaurant streets ===\nWhile central London is full of restaurants and cafes, there are some areas where the majority of diners are Londoners, rather than tourists, and in general you will get a much more pleasant, better value, and less crowded eating experience than you will find in the West End. These places are best visited in the evenings.\n\nClapham Junction is not just a train station, but also home to many good restaurants and bars, in particular on Lavender Hill and Battersea Rise. (Overground: Clapham Junction)\nDrummond Street in the Euston area has a fine mix of Indian restaurants - a short walk from Euston railway station. (Tube: Euston)\nHigh Street Croydon Croydon is derided by most Londoners, however this suburban gem of a road has at least 30 decent restaurants, including three Argentinians, a South African curryhouse, a couple of fancy modern European brassieres, and just about every other type of cuisine you can think of. (Overground: East Croydon)\nKings Street extends on to Chiswick High Road from Hammersmith Tube Station and is one long road of a choice of restaurants at very reasonable prices, some bargain mentions are the Thai restaurants offering two course lunch for \u00a37. Nearby Shepherds bush is about a 15 minute walk and is alive with bars and pubs in the evening. (Tube: Hammersmith)\nLordship Lane in East Dulwich provides a good selection of European restaurants and a few award winning gastropubs. (train: East Dulwich)\nUpper Street in Islington has dozens of excellent restaurants, popular with young professionals. (Tube: Highbury & Islington, Angel).\nWardour Street, in Soho, is full of nice cafes and restaurants. (Tube: Piccadilly Circus)\n\n\n=== Restaurant areas ===\nAs one of the world's most cosmopolitan cities, you can find restaurants serving food cuisine from nearly every country, some of it as good as, if not better than in the countries of origin. Indian food in London is especially famous and there is hardly a district without at least one notable Indian restaurant. London also has excellent options for Chinese, in particular Cantonese food; local chain Royal China is an excellent option if you are looking for high-end fine dining dim sum.\nIf you are looking for other particular regional foods these tend to be clustered in certain areas and some examples are:\n\nBrick Lane in the East End is famous for Bangladeshi curries. (Overground: Shoreditch High Street)\nBrixton for African/Caribbean. (Tube: Brixton)\nChinatown just off Leicester Square for Chinese. (Tube: Leicester Square, Piccadilly Circus)\nEdgware Road in Marylebone and Paddington is popular for Middle Eastern cuisine. (Tube: Edgware Road, Paddington)\nDrummond Street (just behind Euston railway station in the London/Camden district) has lots of vegetarian restaurants - mostly Indian. (Tube: Euston)\nFinsbury Park and Green Lanes, for Greek, Turkish, and Cypriot. (Tube: Finsbury Park/Manor House; Overground: Harringay Green Lanes)\nGolders Green for Jewish fare. (Tube: Golders Green)\nKingsland Road for good cheap Vietnamese.\nTooting, East Ham, Wembley and Southall for authentic and cheap Indian eateries including South Indian restaurants serving hot pongal, dosas, idlis and other South Indian \"tiffin\" items.\nBayswater for Chinese, including the famous Four Seasons roast duck. (Tube: Bayswater, Queensway)\nLambeth between the South Bank and Brixton for Portuguese, Brazilian and diverse Latin American restaurants. (Tube: Kennington, Stockwell, Vauxhall)\nOther nationalities are equally represented and randomly dotted all over London. It is usually wisest to eat in restaurants on main thoroughfares rather than on quiet backstreets.\n\n\n=== Fast food and chains ===\nLike other capitals in the world, London has the usual array of fast food outlets. Sandwich shops are the most popular places to buy lunch, and there are a lot of places to choose from including the ubiquitous Pret a Manger. Some Italian-style sandwich shops have a very good reputation and you can identify them easily by looking at the long queues at lunchtime. If all else fails, central London has lots of mini-supermarkets operated by the big British supermarket chains (e.g., Sainsbury's, Tesco) where you can pick up a pre-packed sandwich.\nFast food with an Asian flair is easy to find throughout the city, with lots of Busaba Eathai, Wagamama, and Yo! Sushi locations throughout the city. Nando's, a popular pseudo-Portuguese restaurant chain, has spicy peri-peri style grilled chicken. For burgers, GBK (Gourmet Burger Kitchen) has been joined by other franchises such as Byron and Hach\u00e9.\n\n\n=== Vegetarian and vegan ===\nLondon has plenty of vegetarian and vegan restaurants many of them championing organic foodstuffs, and a quick search in Google will produce plenty of ideas, so you never have to see a piece of cooked meat all week. Hackney, Dalston, Islington, Soho, Peckham and Brixton are particular vegan hotspots.\nIf you are dining with carnivorous friends most restaurants will cater for vegetarians and will have at least a couple of dishes on the menu. Indian/Bangladeshi restaurants are generally fruitful, as they have plenty of traditional dishes. Good Indian/Bangladeshi options can be found in the Brick Lane area of Spitalfields or further afield in East Ham, Tooting Broadway, and Southall. These also tend to be very cheap eats with authentically prepared dishes with a true local ambience. There are also many vegetarian Thai buffet places where you can eat fake meat in tooth-achingly sweet sauces for under \u00a35. These can be found on Greek Street and Old Compton Street in Soho and Islington High Street.\nMildred's is a great veggie chain with a handful of locations around London. If you're interested in vegan versions of classic British dishes, try \"fish\" and chips from Sutton and Sons in Hackney, and various cafes offer veggie interpretations of a full English breakfast.\n\n\n=== Religious ===\nDue to the mix of cultures and religions, many London restaurants cater well for religious dietary requirements. The most common signs are for Halal and Kosher meat, from burger joints to nice restaurants. There are lots of Halal restaurants and shops all over London including Whitechapel Rd and Brick Lane in the East End, Bayswater, Edgware Rd and Paddington and in many parts of north London. There are plenty of Kosher restaurants in Golders Green, Edgware and Stamford Hill along with some central delis such as on Charing Cross Road.\n\n\n=== Convenience stores and supermarkets ===\nConvenience stores such as Tesco Express, Sainsbury's Central/Local, Budgens, Costcutter, SPAR, Co-op, and privately-run \"corner shops\" will sell pre-made sandwiches, snacks, alcohol, cigarettes, drinks, etc. Most are open from 5AM-11PM although some, such as Tesco Express or convenience stores located at petrol stations, may open 24 hours (some will stop selling alcohol after a certain time). Whistlestop convenience stores, usually found in or around train stations, are notoriously overpriced and should be avoided.\nIf using a petrol station convenience store late at night (i.e. after 11PM) the store will be locked and you should order and pay through the external service window.\n\n\n==== Supermarkets ====\nAlthough Tesco, Sainsbury's and other supermarkets run smaller stores in central London, full-size superstores, including Morrisons and ASDA, are rare in the city centre - with the exception of the Sainsbury's in Pimlico - and you will usually have to take a 15- to 20-minute Tube ride to reach one. \nMarks & Spencer, an upmarket retailer, also operate food halls branded as \"Simply Food\". They can be found across central London. The smaller stores, such as those found in train stations, tend to focus mostly on ready-to-eat food such as sandwiches, drinks, snacks, and also essentials such as bread and milk.\n\n\n== Drink ==\nLondon is home to a great many pubs, bars and nightclubs. The online city guide View London and the weekly magazine Time Out tell what's going in London's night life, as well as cultural events in general.\n\n\n=== Pubs and bars ===\nLondon is an expensive place and your drink will cost more than its equivalent elsewhere in the United Kingdom. Expect to pay \u00a36-7 for a pint of lager or Guinness in an average pub. As with restaurants, pubs close to major tourist attractions cash in on travellers' gullibility so be on your guard for the tourist traps where higher prices are not unheard of. If you're looking to save money and meet travellers then pub crawls are guided tours that run nightly in central London. You'll save the ticket price on the savings you get from discounted drink deals and what you would have spent on club entry. The \"1 Big Night Out\" pub crawl is the biggest operator and starts from near Leicester Square Tube station.\nMany local pubs, especially those run by chains like Wetherspoons and Scream, tend to be more reasonably priced with good drink promotions on weekday nights and during the day. As with the rest of the UK, chain pubs abound which Londoners tend to avoid like the plague. A good place to get cheap beer is at any one of the Sam Smith pubs found across Central London, including Soho and the City.\nIn the Bloomsbury area, check out The Court (near the north end of Tottenham Court Road) and The Rocket (Euston Road). Both are fairly cheap, given that they cater for students of the adjacent University College London. Directly opposite the British Library is The Euston Flyer, popular with locals and commuters alike given its close proximity to St Pancras International railway station.\nClassier bars and pubs can be much more expensive. However, the cost of alcohol drops significantly the further away you go from the centre (West London tends to be an exception, with prices pretty much the same as the centre). For a more reasonably priced (but brilliant) cocktail bar than you'll find in the central and West End areas Lost Society in Clapham on Lavender Hill, cocktails here cost around \u00a37-8 each.\nTwo historic London breweries are Young's and Fullers. Young's was founded in Wandsworth in 1831 (but has relocated to Bedford) and nowadays it has 123 pubs in central London alone. The Founder's Arms next to the Tate Modern on the river embankment, is one of the brewery's most well-known establishments with a great view of the River Thames. Fullers was founded a bit later in 1845 at Chiswick (where you can take a most enjoyable tour of the brewery, including beer-tasting) and the jewel in its crown is probably the Grade I listed Old Bank Of England on Fleet Street, thanks to its breath-taking interiors. Fuller's flagship beer is the famous 'London Pride', however to try a truly authentic Cockney pint, ask at bars if they serve a seldom seen now porter, a dark style of beer originating in London in the 18th century, similar but less heavy than a stout. For a different taste, try a gin and tonic.\nIt's hard to say which pub in London is truly the oldest but it's easy to find contenders for the title. Many pubs were destroyed in the Great Fire of London \u2013 indeed, Samuel Pepys supposedly watched the disaster from the comfort of the Anchor in Borough. Pubs were rebuilt on sites that claimed to have been working pubs since the 13th century. Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese in Fleet Street is on the site of an old monastery and its cellar dates back to the 13th century. The Princess Louise and Cittie of Yorke are two lovely pubs close by along High Holborn with interesting decor; as is the Jerusalem Tavern of Farringdon, a converted Georgian coffee shop, which sells the Norfolk beer, St. Peters. The Royal Oak of Borough, is another pub which is the only representative of an out-of-town brewery in London, that of Harvey's of Lewes. The food is fantastic as is the atmosphere. Those interested in London's historic and literary connections can't miss The Spaniard's Inn in Hampstead. Dick Turpin is said to have been born here; John Keats and Charles Dickens both drank here; it's mentioned in Dickens' The Pickwick Papers and Bram Stoker's Dracula. The Goose at Catford, was reputedly a favourite hole of Karl Marx.\nFor the best view in the city, try pubs on the banks of the Thames. The South Bank has lots of good bars with views of iconic bridges and buildings. One lesser-known cocktail bar sits in the OXO Tower, which is a secret that most tourists walk by every day. Heading towards Bermondsey, pub crowds become a little less touristy. For something historic try the Prospect of Whitby' in Wapping which has been on its site since 1520 and claims to be the world\u2019s oldest riverside tavern.\nIf you're after gastropubs, you may like to visit London's first, The Eagle, in Clerkenwell, established in 1991. You can also try Time Out's favourite newcomer, The Princess Victoria on Uxbridge Road, Shepherd's Bush.\nThe \"Bermondsey Beer mile\" is home to many craft breweries which are open in the middle of the day most Saturdays. Situated under the railway arches on lines going to London Bridge, these quaint breweries are home to high quality beer at cheap to average London prices (~\u00a32 per half). Best places include Kernel Brewery and Brew by Numbers.\nWine buffs can enjoy the famous Davys wine bars that dot the city. The company, established in 1870, import wines and own over thirty bars in the centre. Other big names in wine include the Michelin-starred Cellar Gascon and Vinoteca, both in Smithfield. For a posh wine tasting experience, there is Vinopolis by Borough Market, though a tour price will be as eye-watering as the produce sampled.\nBig hotels, such as The Langham, The Dorchester and The Ritz, and upmarket clubs around Leicester Square and Soho are reliable bets for a date at the bar. The Connaught Hotel in Mayfair-Marylebone boasts its house bar, plus the Time Out magazine favourite, The Coburg. Still in Mayfair, The Polo Bar at The Westbury is very intimate.\nYou can rely on most up-and-running bars to offer a short cocktail menu and there are also bars that position themselves as cocktail specialists.\n\n\n=== Nightclubs ===\nNightlife is an integral part of London life and there are countless nightclubs in and around Central London with music to suit even the most eclectic of tastes. Districts in London tend to specialize in different types of music.\nThe Farringdon/Hoxton/Shoreditch area has many clubs playing drum and bass, techno, house and trance music and is home to the superclub Fabric. The clubs in this area are often home to the world's top DJs and attract a lively, hip and friendly crowd. Big name drum and bass, house and techno DJs also appear at clubs scattered around Kings Cross (Egg, Scala), Elephant (Ministry of Sound, Corsica Studios), Southwark (Cable), Whitechapel (Rhythm Factory), or at mixed nights at the Vauxhall clubs. Nights are also hosted in disused Hackney warehouses or south London car parks.\nThe area around Mayfair is home to the more upmarket clubs in London. This area attracts a rather more showy crowd who love to flaunt what they have and is a must go to celebrity spot. Beware that drinks are ridiculously expensive and many clubs operate a guestlist-only policy. Music played here is often of the commercial chart, funky house, hip hop and R&B genre. Notable clubs include China White, Luxx, Maddox, Jalouse, Funky Buddha, Whisky Mist, Mahiki, No 5 Cavendish Square, Embassy, Vendome and Maya.\nNightclubs around the Leicester Square area hold the same music policy, but are rather more accessible, with numerous club and pub crawl promoters scattered around the area offering deals on entry. Notable clubs are Cafe De Paris, 1 Big Night Out pub crawl, Penthouse, Sound, Tiger Tiger, Zoo bar and Ruby Blue.\nThe Camden area is home to clubs which play Indie, metal and rock music and notably the Electric Ballroom, the world-famous Koko (Fridays) and Underworld. Camden clubs are mostly shut (or empty) on the weekdays. In South London, London's Afro-Caribbean centre Brixton is home to numerous venues with all kinds of music, including a particular presence in reggae, ska, afrobeat, hiphop, and dubstep. There are also venues in Peckham and New Cross.\n\n\n=== Gay and lesbian ===\nSee also: LGBT London\nLondon has a vibrant gay environment with countless bars, clubs and events in almost every district in the city.\nThe nucleus of London's gay scene is undoubtedly Old Compton St and the surrounding area in Soho but over the last couple of years Vauxhall has seen a boom in Gay venues. You will find that many areas, particularly in Camden Town and Shoreditch, that straight bars will have a mixed clientele. To find out what is going on during your visit, you can check:\n\n qxmagazine.com. A weekly magazine that comprehensively covers the London gay scene with handy night by night listings available on-line and in print \n Boyz Magazine. Which is published fortnightly and is freely available at most London gay venues, and contains listings of everything that is happening in all the major clubs in London and the South East. \nGay Pride is held every year in June with a parade and street parties. The choice of places to go sometimes seems to be unmanageable.\n\n London Gay and Lesbian Switchboard (LLGS), \u260f +44 20 7837-7324, admin@llgs.org.uk. This voluntary service has been operating since 1974 and as well as providing counselling they offer an incredibly thorough information service about Gay events, accommodation and businesses in London. \n\n\n== Sleep ==\n\nLondon has hundreds of options for accommodation to suit all budgets from hostels through historic bed and breakfasts (B&Bs), mainstream chain hotels and apartments all the way to some of the most exclusive luxury hotels in the world such as The Savoy, The Ritz and Claridges where a stay in a top suite will cost upwards of \u00a31,000 per night. The average cost of hotel accommodation in London is higher than in any other major British city. Prices invariably become inflated close to major sporting tournaments (such as the London Marathon, Wimbledon or major England football/rugby fixtures), or other important events taking place in the city - so it pays to plan your trip around such occasions or book your accommodation well in advance.\nIn general, most people tend to stay within \"Zone 1\" of the underground, however do your research carefully - sometimes being that extra five minutes away from a station can make the difference in cost and quality of local food and drinking options. In any case, you can always catch a bus anyway - by far the best way to see the city and get about generally. If you stay outside of Zone 1, TfL's travel time map shows which locations have good public transport.\n\n\n=== Hotels ===\nYour budget will have a lot to do with what part of London you will want to stay in. Tourist-standard prices range from \u00a320-200 per person per night. Expect smaller than average rooms especially at the low end of this range. As a general rule, expect to pay between \u00a375 and \u00a3150 per night for a two- or three-star hotel in the central area of the city. Many of the big name chain hotels now offer substantial discounts (with rates often down as low as \u00a330-\u00a350 per room per night) if you book well in advance, but the drawback is that you have to pay the full amount upfront at the time of booking and there are no refunds if you cancel. The heart of the West End is the most expensive place to stay and most hotels are either four- or five-star and most will command a hefty price premium.\nThe City and Canary Wharf can also be very expensive during the week, as they rely heavily on the captive business market, but prices often drop dramatically over the weekend when the business travel dries up. Booking there can be a good way of getting into a higher standard of accommodation than you could otherwise afford. However, much of the City becomes a ghost town over the weekend, and you will find that few bars and restaurants are open away from the main tourist attractions.\nBe exceptionally careful regarding the big \"budget\" hotel chains such as Premier Inn and Travelodge; prices for their London hotels (in contrast to elsewhere) can often meet or exceed those of other, better quality hotels, so it cannot just be assumed that you will get a good deal from them. Some of Travelodge's City of London hotels especially are of shockingly poor quality for the prices they charge.\nA top tip, however, is to always check the likes of LondonTown.com, Expedia and LateRooms as well as the hotel's own website since there are often deals to be had which can reduce the costs significantly.\nThe extra cost of getting around is probably not significant compared to savings made by staying in a hotel further out near an Underground or railway station. Always be sure though to check where the closest Tube station is to your hotel. Staying further out will be cheaper but when travelling in allow 1-2 min per Tube stop (near the centre), around 2-3 min per stop (further out) and 5-10 min per line changes. This can easily total up to a 1 hour journey if there is a walk at each end. There are many hotels close to transport hub stations such as Stratford, Greenwich, Ealing Broadway, Wimbledon and East Croydon.\nA more imaginative alternative could be to stay in a nearby town with quick and easy train travel to London. For example, lively Brighton (otherwise known as 'London by Sea') is only an hour away, but your budget will go much further and there are excellent accommodation options.\nSome of the better value options are to be found in the following central districts:\n\nBloomsbury. Relatively quiet district with a wide range of accommodation, and has enjoyed a surge in popularity following Eurostar's move to St Pancras International station. Cartwright Gardens features a dozen small B&Bs in historic houses. Many budget options are located on Argyle Square (just off the Euston Road). Gets a little seedy towards and beyond King's Cross railway station.\nEarl's Court and West Kensington in west central London. Budget and modest accommodation as well as good 4-star hotels. Be careful with the cheapest accommodation in this area though as it will likely be very seedy indeed.\nPaddington and Bayswater in north west central London. Has undergone a lot of change largely resulting from the Heathrow Express train coming into Paddington station. Good hotels can be found in the immediate area of the station and in quieter spots a short walk away as well as in the traditional mid-range accommodation area further south in Bayswater.\nWestminster. Lots of small B&Bs around the back of Victoria railway station in the Pimlico area.\nA slightly left-field option is to check the Landmark Trust, a building preservation charity who purchase notable old buildings in the UK, renovate and run them as holiday lettings. An interesting approach to saving old buildings for sure.\n\n\n=== Hostels ===\nNot necessarily as unpleasant as you may think, and as long as you don't mind sharing with others, they are the most cost-effective option and also offer breakfast, and kitchens for self-catering.\nThere are independent hostels throughout the city which are listed in the relevant district articles.\nIn the summer season, many of the colleges and universities in Central London open up their student halls of residence as hotels during vacations, at usually much lower rates than proper hotels, but expect very basic facilities (e.g. communal bathrooms, no catering facilities), but you will get the personal privacy that you don't get in hostels for not very much more cost.\n\n\n=== Apartments ===\nSome apartment-hotels offer good value accommodation for those travelling in a group - often better quality than many hotels but at a cheaper individual rate per person.\nCapsule-style crash spaces are just arriving, but they are only in central locations.\nShort-term apartment or flat rentals are an attractive option for many travellers to London, and there are innumerable agencies offering them, almost all of them nowadays through the internet. A key consideration for renting a short term flat is if you are visiting in a large group or a family. In such cases a short stay in London can be more affordable compared to staying in a hotel. Your best protection is to deal only with London apartment rental agencies which have been recommended by independent sources you feel you can trust, and to deal only with those that accept confirmations via credit card.\nAn additional option in this sector is serviced apartments for stays longer than two weeks, the price being between \u00a360 and \u00a3150. The apartments are a hybrid between hotels and apartments, including cleaning and desk services.\n\n\n=== Alternative accommodation ===\nTravellers can choose from a variety of homestay styles such as home-swapping (lovehomeswap.com), living in a temporarily vacated room (anyfriendofours.com) or the high end version where companies specialize in homestays with full hotel services such as housekeeping and concierge (viveunique.com). Most of the time these options are safe but it is important that guests and homeowners take equal precaution to ensure their valuables are safeguarded. Homeowners should always provide guests with terms and conditions of their live-in house rules to ensure there are no mishaps and both parties are at ease. This new trend allows guests to enjoy a less touristy version of London as most of these homes will be in residential areas which each have their own unique charm and experiences.\n\n\n=== Holiday rentals ===\nHotels are generally expensive in London when compared with other European cities. As a result the city has a vast amount of self-catering accommodation on offer. Many of them are apartments in various central areas of the capital. Well established local sites include Holidaylettings.co.uk, Space Apart Hotel, Owners Direct, stay.com and Alpha Holiday Lettings. If you are looking to stay in just a room or part of the property, Airbnb matches holidaymakers with hosts who only rent out part of their homes.\n\n\n== Connect ==\n\n\n=== Wi-Fi access ===\nLondon is unfortunately not noted for free public wifi access - although the number of hotspots is continuing to grow.\n\n O2 Free Hotspots. O2 offers free wifi around London's busiest streets including parts of Oxford Street and Regent Street. Click on the link to see the map. Free. \n Online-4-Free.com. One of the most promising (it seems) for traveller-frequented areas, a service that provides blanket coverage along the banks of the River Thames (and some surrounding streets) from Millbank down to Greenwich Pier, and a small \"cloud\" in Holborn - the free service asks only that you view a short advertisement every half hour to get 256 kbit/s (higher rates and ad-free come at a small charge). Free. \n Tate Modern. Offering free wifi for a trial period. \n British Library. Offers free internet access throughout the library with registration. \n Royal Festival Hall at Southbank Centre. Offers free unencrypted wifi throughout the building without registration. \n Apple Store Regent St (Tube:Oxford Circus). The Apple Store on Regent Street offers free wifi and has a theatre at the back of the first floor where you can sit and spend an hour or two. \n London Underground. Virgin Media offers wifi access at Tube stations. Some mobile phone networks offer free access, otherwise you have to pay. \nFree wifi is also available in many cafes, and the following chain outlets: McDonald's, Pret A Manger, JD Wetherspoon pubs, Costa Coffee, Caffe Nero, Starbucks.\n\n\n== Stay safe ==\nIn an emergency, telephone 999 or 112. This number connects to police, ambulance and fire & rescue services. You will be asked which of these three services you require before being connected to the relevant operator.\n\nLondon has two of the oldest police forces in the world. The Metropolitan Police (The Met) is responsible for policing London except the tiny City of London, which is the responsibility of the City of London Police. In addition to these, the Tube and other railways are patrolled by the British Transport Police. \nOn the whole, London is a safe place to visit and explore. Normal precautions for the safe keeping of your personal possessions, as you would in any other city, are suggested.\n\n\n=== Crime ===\nLike many big cities, London has a variety of social problems, especially begging, drug abuse and theft; mobile phones are a favourite target, often snatched by fast-moving moped riders. \nThe police have placed significant resources in combating street level crime. Working in conjunction with borough councils and the City of London Corporation, they have brought the level of theft and pickpocketing in major retail areas in London to a manageable level. Pickpocketing in London is not as rampant as in other major European cities, though it still pays to be vigilant and take the usual precautions in securing your valuables.\nStreet gang culture is a growing problem in London as with many other cities in England. While most groups of youngsters are not likely to present any danger to tourists, some people feel the need to be slightly more vigilant in certain areas, especially certain outer suburbs. Violent crime is in general not common, but most typically occurs between members of rival gangs, rather than on random members of the public.\n\n\n==== Main precautions to take ====\nKeep valuables out of sight. Many crimes are opportunistic - a lot of mobile phones are snatched from restaurant tables. By keeping items such as cash and mobile phones out of sight theft can easily be prevented. Don't flash your cash unnecessarily!\nKeep bags zipped up and close to your body. If your bag is hanging open it's like putting up a flashing neon sign saying \"Steal from me!\" Use zips and inside pockets to secure items wherever possible. Never leave valuables such as mobile phones, wallets, or travel documents in an outside section of your bag.\nBe aware of your surroundings. Before using your mobile phone have a look around you. Put your back against something solid such as a wall or window so you can't be approached from behind. If you're in a train or Tube station try to use your phone before leaving as all stations have CCTV. Constantly look around you, especially if you are in a busy area. Don't walk and talk/text!\n\n\n==== Late at night ====\nIf you're planning to go out late at night and are worried about safety then try to frequent crowded areas such as the West End. There are always plenty of people on the street, even at 4AM. Generally, outside central London, the south, and east suburban areas are considered more dangerous, notably Brixton, Peckham and Hackney, although some parts of north-west London such as Harlesden and northern Camden are also known trouble spots.\nThe main problem throughout London to various degrees is drunken behaviour, particularly on Friday and Saturday nights and after football matches. Loud and rowdy behaviour is to be expected and fights and acts of aggression also occur. If you are harassed, it is best to simply ignore and walk away from those concerned. Trouble spots can be expected around popular drinking locations such as Soho and in various suburban centres.\n\n\n=== Scams and cons ===\nLondon has a large number of con artists around, all trying to convince you to hand over your money one way or another. In general, you should never give cash or your bank/credit card detail to people on the street no matter how genuine they seem.\nCash machine/ATM scams: Most usage of these machines is perfectly safe, but there are various ways that thieves can either obtain your card or your cash when using an ATM. It is always safest to withdraw cash using a machine inside a bank, but street machines are usually more convenient. Before inserting your card visually check the machine for anything that looks odd. Thieves sometimes install cameras above the pin pad. If things look OK then reach out and wiggle the slot where you insert your card - if the slot's loose, don't put your card in, as there may be a device installed to trap your card. All good? OK, is there anyone standing too close to you or hovering nearby? If so, perhaps cancel the transaction and go elsewhere. If everything's good then go ahead! When obtaining your cash and retrieving your card hover your hand over the slot to be ready to grab them as soon as they come out. Is anyone trying to distract you? Don't let them and leave swiftly. If you notice anything odd about a cash machine or people nearby then phone the police on 101 (999 in an emergency) or report it to the premises the machine is attached to. Don't try to remove any devices yourself.\nCup and ball game: This variant of a scam dating back into antiquity is perhaps the most common and is frequently seen on the busier pedestrian bridges such as Westminster Bridge. A person will lay out a mat with three cups on it. They will pretend to hide a ball under one of the cups, move the cups around, and then ask you to place a bet on where the ball-containing cup has landed. There is no ball - the con artist will have spirited it away! This con always has people acting as lookouts in the crowd and they will pretend to win every now and again so it looks like the game is winnable. Also beware if you are just stopping to watch as you could be pick-pocketed! The best defence is to walk straight past these events and not engage at all. If you have a mobile phone/cellphone that works in the UK you can phone the police on 101 (the non-emergency equivalent to 999) and report them, but it is advised to move away to do this as you may be harassed by the con artist or their lookouts if they overhear you.\nOverzealous street performers: Most street performers are happy to just do their thing, let you watch, and then you can throw them a few coins if you liked the show. However, some street performers will actively grab and harass passers-by in order to get attention and money. They may forcefully pose with you and ask you to take a photograph and then demand money for the photo opportunity. They may also take this opportunity while you're distracted to pick-pocket you. Don't engage with any street performer who is pushy or forceful - try and walk away, or call out \"Get off me!\" or \"No!\" and draw attention to yourself if you can't escape easily. Again, you can report these bogus street performers on the 101 number as above.\nTissue sellers on trains: Beggars will get onto a train and place tissues on the seats with a note begging for money. They want you to feel pity for them and buy the tissues, but this is an organised scam and the money goes towards criminal enterprises. If you see this happening on a train don't buy the tissues and ignore anyone who asks you for money for them. If you're above ground you can text the British Transport Police on 61016 to report it.\n\"Clip joint\": Every night, Soho presents a particular danger: the \"clip joint\". The usual targets of these establishments are lone male tourists. Usually, an attractive woman will casually befriend the victim and recommend a local bar or even a club that has a \"show\". The establishment will be near-desolate, and, even if the victim has only a drink or two, the bill will run to hundreds of pounds. If payment is not immediately provided, the bouncers will lock the \"patrons\" inside and take it by force or take them to an ATM and stand over them while they extract the cash. To be safe, if a woman you just met suggests you a place, try to recommend a different bar. If she insists on hers then walk away and do not listen to her suggestions. Sometimes this con trick takes place when someone is lured into a private club with the promise of something perhaps more than a drink (like a \"private show\" or sex for a small amount of money). A \"hostess fee\" will appear on the bill for several hundred pounds, even though there has been nothing more than polite conversation.\n\"Stress tests\": If anyone offers you a free \"stress test\", they are likely trying to recruit you into the Church of Scientology. The best option is to walk away or just say \"No thank you\" politely, as people are commonly harassed into giving personal details.\nNeeding money for phone/train tickets/the bus/et al.: Someone will approach you asking for money for public transport. They will claim that they have lost their Travelcard or that it has been damaged somehow. Most people upon losing their Travelcard will seek aid at a train station and not approach random strangers! Another variant of this scam exists wherein a man or woman will ask for change so they can make a call at a phone box. Occasionally a person with a very convincing fake injury will ask for money so that they can get a taxi to hospital, strangely refusing the offer of you calling an ambulance or the police for them as you would do for most injured people in the street. Ignore them.\nTicket machine scam: One of the most popular scams in London is the ticket machine scam: While buying a ticket at a train station someone will approach you and act as if they want to help you buy the right ticket. In reality, they will wait until your money is in the machine, then lean across, cancel the transaction and pocket your cash. Say \"No thanks\" politely - you know what ticket you want to buy!\nSelling/asking for a donation for \"lucky heather\": This scam, usually operated by women, involves someone handing you \"lucky heather\" (a small flower usually wrapped in foil) and then either trying to sell it to you or asking for a monetary donation. They will come up with a vague charity (\"money for sick children\", \"money for orphaned babies\", and so on) and show you a purse full of supposed \"donations\". If you are handed one of these flowers either hand it back or drop it on the ground and leave. Be aware that you if you take the flower and leave without \"donating\" you could be chased and harassed by the people involved in the scam.\nPedicabs: A common sight in central London is a brightly lit rickshaw blaring loud music and offering rides. You should not use them as they are presently unregulated and often seriously overcharge their passengers.\n\n\n=== Hostility toward Jews and Israelis ===\nAs of January 2025, anyone displaying Jewish or Israeli symbols may face harassment or even assault in London, and police may blame you for \"provocation\" just for wearing such symbols, rather than protecting you.\n\n\n=== Street collections ===\nAlthough not illegal, London is a known hotspot for charity collectors, some of whom can be extremely persuasive in trying to obtain a donation; therefore they have earned the name \"charity muggers\" or \"chuggers\". If you do not want to donate, be polite but forceful, and under no circumstances provide any form of bank details. Larger charities ask their collectors to have specific and verifiable identification.\n\n\n=== Transport ===\nDon't take illegal minicabs (see Get around for details). No Minicabs are allowed to ply for trade on the street, and any doing this should be avoided.\nTravelling on the lower deck of a night bus is generally safer, as there are more passengers around, and you are visible to the bus driver.\nIf you've lost an item on the Underground, Overground or Docklands Light Railway, in a licensed black cab, or on a red London bus then you should contact the TfL Lost Property Office as soon as possible. If an item is lost or misplaced on other transport services in London, the relevant service operator should be contacted.\nBank, credit and debit cards, when found, are securely destroyed. Contact your bank immediately if you lose these on a transport service.\n\n\n== Stay healthy ==\nThe UK's National Health Service (NHS) will provide emergency treatment for anyone in the UK, irrespective of whether they reside in the UK, but if you are not a UK resident you will be expected to make a contribution (up to the entire cost) towards such treatment. Travel insurance is essential. You can find NHS services near you here.\nFor the most up-to-date information on COVID-19, consult the UK Government coronavirus portal, or the [https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/ NHS COVID-19 page.\n\n\n=== Emergencies ===\nFor a life-threatening medical emergency (unconsciousness, stroke, heart attack, severe bleeding that won't stop, etc.) dial 999 or 112 and ask for an ambulance. These numbers are free of charge from any telephone. When you call, the operator will ask for details about the patients and your location; answering these questions will not delay help. As emergency response is prioritised in London the operator needs to know what resources they need to use and how quickly you need them.\nLondon's ambulance coverage is excellent with highly trained and friendly staff. For instances of major trauma there is also London's Air Ambulance, two helicopters that can deliver an advanced trauma team within minutes to anywhere in London. At night the helicopters do not fly and a rapid response car is dispatched instead.\nEmergencies can also be dealt with at most NHS hospitals with an A & E (Accident & Emergency) department. In A & E, be prepared to wait for a long time (although the target is 4 hours, waits can be longer than this) before being given treatment if your medical complaint is not critical. For less serious problems, try an Urgent Care Centre, or a high-street pharmacist.\n\n\n==== Major hospitals ====\nMajor A & E hospitals in London are:\n\nCharing Cross Hospital, Fulham Palace Rd, Hammersmith, W6 8RF\nChelsea & Westminster Hospital, 369 Fulham Rd, Chelsea, SW10 9TR\nSt George's Hospital, Blackshaw Road, Tooting, SW17 0QT\nHomerton University Hospital, Homerton Row, Homerton, E9 6SR\nKing's College Hospital, Denmark Hill, SE5 9RS\nUniversity Lewisham Hospital, High St, SE13 6LH\nQueen Elizabeth Hospital, Stadium Road, Woolwich, SE18 4QH\nRoyal Free Hospital, 23 East Heath Rd, Hampstead, NW3 1DU\nThe Royal London Hospital, Whitechapel, E1 1BB\nSt Marys NHS Trust, Praed St, Paddington, W2 1NY\nSt Thomas' Hospital, Lambeth Palace Rd, South Bank, SE1 7EH\nUniversity College London Hospitals NHS Trust, 25 Grafton Way, Bloomsbury, WC1E 6DB\nWhittington Hospital, Highgate Hill, Archway, N19 5NF\n\n\n=== General medical advice ===\nFor advice on non-emergency medical problems, you can ring the 24 hour NHS Direct service on 111.\nTreatment for non-emergency conditions, or for hospital admissions resulting from emergencies, is normally free for people holding a European Health Insurance card (EHIC) issued by most European governments, or certain other countries listed here. In the absence of such a card you would be well advised to get private travel health insurance.\nAt large organised events, and in many theatre productions, basic medical assistance and first aid is provided through the support of organisations such as St John Ambulance or the stewards for the event.\n\n\n==== Pharmacies ====\nPharmacies (often referred to as \"chemists\") are found across London, with chains such as Lloyds Pharmacy and Boots being prevalent. Many independent pharmacies also exist. Most large supermarkets also have pharmacy counters, although these do not stock some of the stronger remedies. Unlike other European countries pharmacies in the UK are not often marked by prominent neon \"green cross\" signs.\nPharmacists are also able to offer advice on many health problems and recommend medicines that might help. For certain remedies (for example stronger painkillers) you may have to ask at the counter, as for regulatory reasons these can only be sold by pharmacists under strict protocols. Don't be alarmed if the pharmacist asks some basic diagnostic questions or for your ID.\n\n\n== Cope ==\n\n\n=== Finding a toilet ===\nNeed to spend a penny? Some businesses allow people to use their facilities without purchasing anything, others reserve them for customers only. The Great British Public Toilet Map attempts to map publicly-accessible toilets and baby changing facilities.\nAll the main London rail terminals now have free toilets, although cleanliness can vary. Transport for London have produced a map of stations on their network with a toilet. Where a pictogram is black, this indicates that lavatories are outside the gateline (thus open to all), while red pictograms mark toilets which are inside the gateline so only accessible to passengers or those willing to pay to touch in and out. Finally, the presence of an asterisk tells you whether a fee is charged for use of the facilities.\nFor fact fans: the Central line has the most stations with toilets, at 29, and the Piccadilly line is close behind with 28. However, the sheer length of these lines and the number of stations skew the figures. Therefore, the lines with the greatest proportion of stations with loos and thus those lines which are best for regular customers are the Metropolitan line with 27 toilets out of a total of 34 stations (or 79% coverage), and the Jubilee line with 21 comfort areas across 27 stations (77%). As a shuttle between two of the busiest stations on the network, the Waterloo and City line naturally hits 100% loo coverage, and with its name you'd be disappointed if it didn't. By contrast, passengers should be prepared to cross their legs on the Docklands Light Railway, as across a network of 45 stations, a paltry 6 have toilets.\n\n\n=== Embassies and High Commissions ===\nLondon is a good place to get visas, being home to the fourth largest number of diplomatic missions in the world. Some embassies have a separate consular section for issuing visas, passports, notary services, etc., found in a different location from the chancery. It is advised to check their website or call them ahead of time if you need these services. The major English-speaking countries' embassies are marked on the dynamic map at the top of the article; to locate them, click the green number next to their flag.\n\n\n== Go next ==\nNerd activities in London\n\n\n=== England ===\n\n\n==== Day-trips ====\nAylesbury \u2013 Historic market town.\nBerkhamsted \u2013 Historic market town.

        "title": "Zurich",
        "extract": "Zurich (German: Z\u00fcrich, Swiss German: Z\u00fcri) is the largest city in Switzerland and an international financial centre. Zurich is close to some excellent skiing resorts and many people headed for the Swiss Alps don't spend much time in Zurich itself, but you'd be missing a lot if you don't stay in Zurich for a couple of days at least.\n\n\n== Understand ==\n\nWhile Zurich is Switzerland's biggest city and a cultural centre of German-speaking Switzerland,  Berne is the Swiss capital.  It has a population of some 430,000 (2022) in the city, and 1.8 million (2011) in the metro area.  Zurich is on Lake Zurich, where the lake meets the river Limmat, in the north of Switzerland.  \nDespite it not being the administrative capital of any more than its Kanton, Zurich punches well above its weight in terms of major media and business headquarters and due to it being at the heart of Switzerland's excessively punctual and meticulously maintained train network and being home to Switzerland's most important airport, it is often the first part of Switzerland that visitors get to see. \n\nWhile Zurich can be expensive, it is also clean, efficient and blessed with a high standard of living, which together with the high wages, explains why people bear with the high prices. Zurich has drawn people from the rest of Switzerland for centuries, but in the 20th and 21st centuries it has also begun to draw both people and companies from outside Switzerland and in some cases even outside Europe. This means that you will hear a lot more languages than just Swiss German and the overall atmosphere is a lot more cosmopolitan than you might think.\nZurich is home to ETH Zurich, one of the world's leading technical universities, which has produced a number of Nobel laureates and numerous innovations and due to Switzerland's long history of neutrality it also houses headquarters of the likes of FIFA and the International Ice Hockey Federation. Zurich is also home to a number of large banking and insurance conglomerates that grew on the fabled Swiss banking secret and still enjoy good reputations in the financial sector.\n\n\n=== History ===\nThe city's Latin name, Turicum, was used for a Roman customs station at the Limmat, which has some remnants today. The Alemanni, a Germanic tribe, settled in the 5th century.\nWhile the Church used to rule early Medieval Zurich, the Guilds (Z\u00fcnfte) took power in 1336, establishing Zurich as an autonomous republic. The Guilds have survived until today, though their role today is mostly ceremonial. Zurich became the fifth canton of the Swiss Confederacy in 1351, and has been its capital at times. However, Switzerland's famous neutrality and stability is a modern thing, as many battles have been fought in and around Zurich. The canton lost the Old Z\u00fcrich War between 1440 and 1446 against the confederacy, and was re-admitted in 1450.\nUlrich Zwingli led the Protestant Reformation in Switzerland during the early 16th century. As the Thirty Years War ended in 1648, the Holy Roman Empire lost its grip on Switzerland, which has mostly been independent since then.\nThe 1830s and 40s saw a series of revolts and war, including the Z\u00fcriputsch, a revolt of conservative landowners of the canton, against the city of Zurich, and the 1847 Sonderbund War. In 1848 Switzerland adopted a constitution, which established the country as a federal republic. While the government settled in Bern, many federal institutions, including the new Polytechnic University (ETH) have their seat in Zurich.\nThe Zurich Stock Exchange was founded in 1877, and the city rose as a financial centre in the 20th century, as Switzerland remained neutral in the World Wars, and could maintain lower taxes on capital than the European great powers. Even though Switzerland has opted out of NATO and the European Union, Zurich is today one of central Europe's most cosmopolitan cities.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nZurich has a four-season climate typical of central Europe. Temperature in winter is usually around zero degrees, which means that snow can linger or melt away. Summers are warm with temperatures in the 20s (C) and occasionally in the 30s. The nearby mountains are significantly cooler than in the valley, with snow remaining well into spring.\n\n\n=== Tourist information ===\nZurich Tourism website\n\n\n== Get in ==\n\n\n=== By plane ===\n\nMain article: Zurich Airport\n1 Zurich Airport (ZRH IATA)  is Switzerland's largest and busiest airport, handling roughly 30 million passengers a year. It is in the community of Kloten and it is 10 minutes by train from the main station. The trains depart about every 10-15 minutes, during the day, but less frequently at earlier or later hours. A single ticket to the Hauptbahnhof (Main station, a.k.a. \"Z\u00fcrich HB\") costs Fr. 6.80. Several bus lines connect to the airport and provide access to the Winterthur region near it. There is also tram 10 from Zurich terminating at the airport, a rather slow option, but it might be faster door to door for some destinations in Zurich.\n\nMost major airlines fly to Zurich but flag-carrier Swiss is still the biggest player at ZRH and offers the widest range of connections. Almost every large hotel in Zurich provides shuttle buses from the airport to your hotel. The stops for these buses are a short walk to the right from Terminal 1 arrivals.\nZurich Airport has high passenger costs due to several noise reduction and approach restrictions. Most no-frill airlines fly to Basel which is 1 hour away by train. EasyJet  offer several flights to Germany, the UK and Southern Europe.\n\nIf you are travelling without a Schengen Visa to another destination in Europe (via Zurich airport) and if you are not a European citizen, you must not stay in Europe for longer than 90 days \u2014 even if your final destination would allow citizens of your country to stay for more than 90 days. Failure to do so will lead to very high fines (around \u20ac8100) should you try to leave Europe via Zurich airport .\nZurich Airport offers free WiFi for all guests for a maximum of two hours. A mobile phone capable of receiving texts in Switzerland is required. Travelers have to connect to the \"ZurichAirport\" network and register their cell phone number. The user will receive the access code via text message. After the free hour, there is a five-hour waiting period before you can access the next free hour.\n\n\n=== By train ===\nRegular trains to and from other Swiss and European cities leave from and arrive at Hauptbahnhof, the main train station, located in the city centre at the end of Bahnhofstrasse, with easy access to mass transit. The Zurich Hauptbahnhof (HB) is served by the local S-Bahn commuter trains, InterCity (IC and ICN) connections throughout Switzerland, Italy, Germany's IC and ICE, France's TGV Lyria and Austria's Railjet with some direct connections reaching destinations as far in Eastern Europe as Budapest. While Switzerland itself does not have many high speed lines, Zurich is connected to the high speed rail networks of neighboring countries. The once extensive sleeper train network has been cut down a lot in the 21st century, but there are still some \u00d6BB Nightjets connecting Austria and Germany with Zurich. Non-nightjet sleeper trains also run to Zurich from Prague and Budapest.\nDomestic train tickets within Switzerland are available through the SBB Website though there are few early bird discounts. International tickets can sometimes be bought through the SBB as well, but often you can get better offers through the DB website (German) the SNCF website (France) or the websites of \u00d6BB and Trenitalia for Austria and Italy respectively. All adjacent railways have (sometimes significant) discounts for early booking on international trains, so if you know your plans far in advance, by all means book early.\nThe train station and the connecting underground mall has shops, restaurants, and a grocery store which locals use when they need to do Sunday shopping, as it is not subject to the closing hours laws otherwise in force in the city. It also hosts a Christmas market and other events in the big entrance hall.\nThere are some 24-hour lockers in level B1 available for Fr. 6-9 per 24 hr (maximum 3 days).\nJust to the east of the train station on the Bahnhofbr\u00fccke bridge, there is a large Coop supermarket open Monday to Saturday till 22:00.\n\n\n=== By car ===\nThe region around Zurich has probably the highest density of highways in the country, which makes it very convenient to access. A1 goes past Zurich just north of the city, with two feeders into the city centre. A3 and A4 end just south of the city. The regional highways A51, A52 and A53 all also lead to Zurich. While this makes it that there are many ways to drive into the city from every direction, it also means that there is a lot of congestion, especially during morning and evening hours. Parking is also hard to get at affordable rates, so it might therefore be faster and more convenient to travel by public transport.\n\n\n=== By bus ===\n2 Bus station at Sihlquai. The inter-city bus station is two blocks away from the main train station, near the confluence of the Sihl and Limmat and serves mainly international routes by Flixbus and BlaBlaCar. It just consists a parking lot next to a gas station (not open 24/7) (updated Nov 2024)\n\n\n=== By boat ===\nIt is possible to reach Zurich by boat on the lake from Rapperswil (2 hours) or Horgen (45 minutes). However, this is more of a leisure boat and only offers a couple of trips each day.\n\n\n== Get around ==\n\n \n\n\n=== Public transport ===\nZurich is famous for its highly efficient, clean and safe public transport system, managed by the Z\u00fcrcher Verkehrsverbund (ZVV) which covers the entire canton of Zurich as well as Rapperswil-Jona in the canton of St. Gallen and Pf\u00e4ffikon SZ in the canton of Schwyz. The network includes trams, buses, S-Bahn (suburban trains), cable cars and boats. The size and complexity of the network may be daunting at first, but you will soon realize that there are dozens of ways to get from one place to another and following any of them will still be efficient.\nTimetable information for Switzerland is available on sbb.ch or can be obtained using the SBB Mobile (iOS, Android apps) (requires a working internet connection). Or simply use ZVV's own timetable app; its advantage is that it also informs you about local disturbances or delays! You can also purchase ticket on ZVV-Tickets app. The free Wemlin App (iOS, Android) gives you offline access to timetable information and network maps for the canton of Zurich area without internet connection and is therefore ideally for on the go usage in case you don't want to use data roaming.\nYou may want to consider using the EasyRide function of the SBB Mobile app, which allows you to \"check-in\" to rides and calculates the cheapest ticket charge at the end of the day.\nThe system is divided into numerous fare zones, with the city centre and innermost suburbs being in zone 110 and the outer suburbs located in other zones (Winterthur is in zone 120, for example), and the more zones you pass through, the more you'll have to pay for your journey. There are single tickets, day cards, monthly cards and annual cards. The monthly and annual cards are collectively referred to as ZVV NetzPass.\nTickets must be purchased from a ticket vending machine before boarding or from one of the ticket selling kiosks. The ticket vending machines are in German, English, French and Italian and offer almost all regular tickets available (not personal tickets though). You select the zones you wish to pass through upon buying the ticket, with a zone map on every machine as well as clear instructions coming to your aid, so feel free to choose! Once you've got your ticket it gives you access to all modes of transport. Both the ZVV and the SBB app provide a \"check-in/check-out\" mechanism: check in before you start your trip, check out when you end your trip. The best-priced ticket for your day is computed at the end of the day and charged on the following day. It does require data access and localization, as well as means of payment (typically credit card) to be added to the app. It is very important to check-in before the time of the departure of the means of transportation you enter, as fines may be issued on control otherwise.\nIf you're staying for a longer period, consider a monthly ZVV NetzPass, because even though there are no regular tickets valid for something between 1 day and a month, it takes only 10 \"zone 110\" day cards for a \"zone 110\" monthly card to be cheaper. When travelling in all zones, it takes only 8 day cards for the monthly card to be cheaper. A 24-hour ticket for zone 110 costs just the same as two single rides.\nIf you don't mind starting your travels after 09:00, the \"ZVV-9-UhrPass\" is the best option. It is available as daily, monthly and annual cards, and will save you a lot of money compared to regular similarities, especially given that the 09:00 rule does not apply on weekends.\nThere are also so-called Z-passes, which can be used not only in Zurich, but also in one of the neighbouring cantons (Aargau, Schaffhausen, Schwyz, Zug, St. Gallen or Thurgau); however, only one additional canton is possible, so if you're not going to one neighbouring canton more often than the others you are probably better off with just a normal all zones Zurich monthly card and buying single ticket from the last valid station to your final destination. The Z-pass system also has its zones, even in the neighbouring cantons. It is only available as monthly and annual cards and can not be bought from ticket vending machines.\nFor all details regarding fares, see the ZVV home page linked to above.\nThe Swiss Travel Pass (not to be confused with the SwissPass) is valid on all public transport in Zurich and, if you are a tourist visiting most of Switzerland, this may be your best way to saving money and time spent trying to figure out zones, routes, and fare options. Eurail passes are valid only on the S-Bahn and boats. Interrail passes are valid on the S-Bahn (although the ZVV website claims a \"reduction\" for other routes for Interrail holders). Nevertheless, you may find you don't need the trams and buses if you don't mind walking around a little.\n\n\n==== By tram and bus ====\n\nSeveral tram lines, trolleybuses and buses cover the city at street level. Like all other public transport in Zurich, you must purchase and validate tickets before boarding, or risk a fine if they decide to spot check. You can find a timetable at every stop which is usually accurate to the minute, however delays do occur due to heavy traffic, rerouting, or other factors.\n\n\n==== By rail ====\nThe 'S-Bahn' is Zurich's convenient and fast suburban rail system which covers nearly all suburbs of Zurich and beyond. Zurich's S-Bahn system provides convenient and fast service throughout the region. All lines except the rural ones pass through the Hauptbahnhof. The ZVV offers directions for a series of excursions on the S-Bahn.\nYou must have a validated ticket before you board. If you do not have a ticket you will be liable for an on-the-spot fine of Fr. 100.\n\n\n==== By boat ====\nThere are two types of boat-based public transport operated in Zurich: river buses and lake boats. The river boats operate in the summer months only and the lake boats operate on a much reduced schedule during the winter.\nThe river buses operate between the Landesmuseum (near the Hauptbahnhof) along the river Limmat and out in the Z\u00fcrichsee (Lake Z\u00fcrich) to Tiefenbrunnen. There are several stops along the Limmat.\nThe Z\u00fcrichsee Schifffahrtsgesellschaft (ZSG) operates lake boats (including two historic restored steam ships) which leave from Burkliplatz (at the end of Bahnhofstrasse). The ZSG's website provides information on destinations and ships. The ZSG offers a variety of tourist-oriented trips (including Jazz Brunch), and a popular trip is to Rapperswil at the south end of the Z\u00fcrichsee. The town has a beautiful castle overlooking the lake surrounded by a medieval town.\n\n\n=== On foot ===\nThe main train station, old town and the lake promenade and all nearby tourist attractions are easily walkable. You may find that you don't need transport for most of your tourist needs once you get into the city.\n\n\n=== By bike ===\nZurich is generally easy to get around by bicycle. There are bike lanes marked out in most parts of the city and if you don't mind the hills, a bike might be a fast and cheap alternative to public transport. The city has an online map service, which can calculate routes for biking and also shows locations of bike parking and pumps. Many of the major intersections don't have bike lanes due to space constraints, but it is generally possible to avoid those. Note that cycling on the pavement is not allowed. Cyclist are commonly fined for cycling against the traffic or ignoring traffic lights.\nZ\u00fcri rollt offers free bike \"rental\" around the city. To get a free bike, you have to register with your I.D. or passport and pay a refundable deposit of Fr. 20. There are seven stations. Two of them are located at the main station (3 North bike gate and 4 south bike gate) and are operated year round. The rest are operated only from April to October. Two of them are near the old town at 5 Globus City and at 6 Bellevue. The opening hours vary by station, but most of them are operated daily from 09:00-21:30.\nPubliBike is the city's bike sharing program, with e- and normal bikes offered at a dense network of stations throughout the city. The bikes need to be borrowed and returned at these stations and will be more expensive than public transport for a quick ride. E-Scooter sharing services are also provided by Voi and Lime, the latter also providing E-Bikes.\n\n\n=== By car ===\nDriving in Zurich is possible, but it is painful as the city centre is not easy to navigate by car. It's cheaper and more convenient to park outside the city and take a train.\n\n\n=== By taxi ===\nThe taxis in Zurich are very expensive compared to New York, London and other major cities. Most of the taxi drivers are unfriendly and uncommunicative. Better travel by tram, bus or S-bahn. Uber have stopped their UberX service and now offer only the regular and UberBlack service.\n\n\n== Talk ==\nSee also: Swiss-German phrasebook, German phrasebook\n\nFor formal speech and writing, German-speaking Swiss use Swiss Standard German (Schweizer Hochdeutsch), which is very similar to standard German. The Zurich dialect (Z\u00fcrit\u00fc\u00fctsch) is dominant among the Swiss German (Schweizerdeutsch) dialects, and is difficult to understand for non-Swiss.\nEnglish is widely spoken, at least among the young and businesspeople.\n\n\n== See ==\nMost of the interesting sights are in the old town around the river and lakefront.\n\n1 Bahnhofstrasse. One of the busiest and best-known shopping streets in the world. Highly refined. Certainly a must-see for every tourist in Zurich!   \n\n2 Lindenhof. The hill in the heart of the old town. A beautiful view of the city and one time location of a Roman fort.   \n3 Lake Promenade (Utoquai, Seefeldquai). Especially during summer, the lake is a beautiful place to spend the evening or the weekend. Starting from Bellevue, the boardwalk goes for about three kilometers along the lake towards Tiefenbrunnen. About halfway from Bellevue there is a meadow where you will find thousands of people on a sunny day. \n4 Grossm\u00fcnster, Zwingliplatz. November-February 10\u02d000-17\u02d000, March-October 10\u02d000-18\u02d000. Old Romanesque church, symbol of reformed Zurich, where reformer Huldrych Zwingli was appointed the people's priest in 1519. Go up the tower for a great view of Zurich, though the stairs can be quite small and steep. Tower Fr. 4, Fr. 2 for students.   (updated May 2017)\n5 Fraum\u00fcnster, K\u00e4mbelgasse 2. November-February 10:00-17:00, March-October 10:00-18:00. Old Gothic church (former convent) with window paintings made by Marc Chagall. No photos or videos allowed inside. Fr. 5.   (updated May 2017)\n6 Schanzengraben. A small canal that used to be part of the city fortifications between Limmat and Sihl. From the main station, go to Gessnerallee, find the stairways down to the tiny creek, and walk all the way to the lake.   \n7 Langstrasse. Red light district of Zurich, with more drug dealers and police than usual, but interesting because even this most notorious spot in Switzerland is so clean and safe. The area is the most overtly multicultural spot of the town. Ateliers and stylish bars sit side by side the strip clubs.   \n8 Friedhof Fluntern. cemetery with lots of famous people most notably James Joyce who lived in Zurich for quite some time, the writer Elias Canetti and a few nobel prize winners are also buried there   (updated Dec 2017)\n9 Zoo, Z\u00fcrichbergstrasse 221, \u260f +41 44 254 25 00, zoo@zoo.ch. Mar-Oct 09:00\u201318:00, Nov-Feb 09:00\u201317:00. With the new Masoala Rainforest Hall, the Zoo is really worth a visit! Fr. 26 for adults (Fr. 19 for those under 25).   (updated Jul 2017)\n10 China Garden, Bellerivestrasse 138, \u260f +41 44 380 31 51. Apr-Oct daily 11:00\u201319:00. This small but beautiful Chinese garden was offered to the city of Zurich by the Chinese city of Kunming as symbol of gratitude after Zurich helped Kunming with technical knowledge. It can be very well combined with a stroll along the lake or a visit to the Pavillon Le Corbusier.   (updated Nov 2024)\n11 Niederdorf. The old town offers beautiful alleys, restaurants and shopping mainly aimed at younger consumers. In the evenings, people visit the Niederdorf's many bars.   (updated Aug 2015)\n12 Zurich West. This modern quarter used to be an industrial one, but modern urban developments made it into a centre of vibrant night life.   \n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\n13 Landesmuseum (National Museum), Museumstrasse 2, \u260f +41 44 218 65 11. Tu-Su 10:00\u201317:00 and most public holidays including M, Th until 19\u02d000. This is the place to go if you want to learn more about the history of Switzerland. There are permanent exhibitions on history, archaeology and art. Changing temporary exhibitions usually also turn around Swiss topics. Fr. 10/8.

This is the last building designed by the Swiss architect le Corbusier. The Pavillon was built after his death as a museum dedicated to his work. Access to the building has long been difficult and expensive, also due to a legal fight between the former patron and initiator of the building and the city of Zurich. Now it is however managed by the city and open to the public. The highlight of the museum is of course the building itself, but there are also yearly changing exhibitions on architecture. Fr. 12/8.

Every year this event attracts nearly a million visitors who dance in the streets to the music which you can hear from anywhere in the city. After the Street Parade the party doesn't stop, there are open air parties along the route until midnight and club parties at various locations in town until late the next day, to keep the party going.

The Zurich Opera shows frequently changing productions of world famous operas with top artists. As with the Schauspielhaus, students get a big last-minute discount.

Frequently changing arthouse movies; students get a discount. \n\n\n== Buy ==\nCurrency: Switzerland is a land of banks and financial institutions, so getting local cash from ATMs at banks, railway stations and within shopping malls should pose no problem. Euros are accepted at many larger stores and places that cater to international visitors, though the exchange rate offered will be much worse than what your bank offers you. Eighth-series Swiss banknotes were withdrawn in April 2021 (10 Fr Le Corbusier, 20 Fr Honegger, 50 Fr Taeuber-Arp) but can be exchanged without time limit at any Swiss National Bank. You want the ninth series, see Switzerland#Buy.\n\n\n=== Shopping districts ===\n\nFor shopping in Zurich there are three different areas in the centre:\n\n1 Bahnhofstrasse. Runs from the Z\u00fcrich Train Main station \"Hauptbahnhof\" right down to the lake. Bahnhofsstrasse is famous for being one of the most exclusive and expensive shopping streets in the world. Here you can get anything from diamond rings to chocolate to fur coats. Globus and Jelmoli are two fiercely competitive department stores, both of which carry items from many high-end brands. \n2 Niederdorf. The Old Part of Zurich which expands from \"Bellevue\" by the Lake right to \"Central\" which is just over the river from the train station. The Niederdorf is more for young people. Aside from a lot of fast food places you will find a lot of trendy clothes stores here. \n3 L\u00f6wenstrasse. Runs west of Bahnhofstrasse from the main train station, has shops selling everyday items and a large branch of Migros, a department store chain. \n\n\n=== Swiss clocks and watches ===\nYou may be disappointed to know that most of the cheap watches and clocks in Switzerland are imported from China and Japan for their cheap quartz movements (including most of the wall clocks and alarm clocks sold at department stores, for example). Don't purchase a \"Migros Budget\" clock for Fr. 8 thinking it is a Swiss clock! Nevertheless, real Swiss-made clocks are still well known for their quality and reliability, and intricate mechanics. The following are true Swiss-made watches:\n\nSwatch, possibly your best bet for a \"cheap\" Swiss watch (Fr. 40-100) and perhaps better suited for the younger generation. Available in their stores on Bahnhofstrasse and various other locations, or in department stores.\nM-Watch, based on both Mondaine and Migros and available in Migros Electronics stores such as the one on the 2nd floor of the Lowenplatz location. Also relatively inexpensive (Fr. 40-100). Do not confuse this with \"M-Budget\" which is an imported cheap watch.\nMondaine is known for their use of the famous SBB railway clock face. You can buy a replica of the SBB clock as a watch or a wall clock in most major railway stations, among other locations. However, most of them do not replicate the hallmark smooth movement of the second hand for 58.5 seconds followed by the 1.5-second pause that is characteristic of real SBB railway clocks, but they do replicate the clock face. They are quartz, and the price may seem a little inflated to you (Fr. 130-180). The vast majority of SBB railway clocks are produced by Mobatime (Moser-Baer AG), not Mondaine, even though Mondaine's name appears on some of the larger clocks such as the Treffpunkt in Zurich HB. Mondaine's wall and desk clocks, however, are only of \"Swiss design\" and are manufactured in China and Taiwan.\nMid-range brands (Fr. 100-500) can be found at clock and watch stores throughout the city. Just walk in and have a look if you're interested.\nUpper-end watches and clocks, such as Rolex, are also sold, but you should probably do more research into them than you can find here. If you just want to stare at some of the most expensive watches for sale, take a look at the Bucherer store window at Bahnhofstrasse and see what a Fr. 25,000 watch looks like.\n\n\n=== Swiss chocolate ===\n\n\n==== Brands ====\nFrey is not as well known abroad as other Swiss brands, but with a market share of roughly 35%, it is the most popular brand in Switzerland. It mostly produces for the Migros supermarket chain and is known as good quality chocolate at a cheap price. A big share of the production is also exported, mostly however under store brand labels for chains such as Marks & Spencer, Loblaw, Tesco, Coles. The factory is in Aarau (about 1 hour by train and bus), where there is also a visitor centre.\nLindt is available at the Coop and other supermarkets besides Migros for Fr. 2-2.50, but Lindt chocolates are also sold at the Lindt & Sprungli Chocolate Factory Shop, which is accessible by taking the S-Bahn S8 to Kilchberg (12 min) and then bus 165 to the stop \"Lindt & Spr\u00fcngli\" (2-3 min). Hours are limited (M-F 09:00\u201317:00). The factory store prices are somewhat lower than supermarket prices (on the order of 10-20%), but there are some sale items, including factory rejects (for underweight chocolates, improper packaging, or filling showing through) that are sold for roughly half-price. The Lindt factory used to offer tours and free samples, but this is no longer the case.\nChocolats Halba belongs to Coop     and produces all own-brand chocolates for the retailer (e.g. Naturaplan, Qualit\u00e9 & Prix, Prix Garantie, Karma). Chocolats Halba also produces for customers abroad - including in Germany, France, the USA, Canada, New Zealand and China. Chocolats Halba specialises in sustainable chocolate. Overproductions are sold in the outlet shop, the Schoggih\u00fcsli, located in Hinwil (Z\u00fcrichstrasse 55, 8340 Hinwil). The offer is seasonally adapted and low-priced. It includes, for example, broken chocolate in a 1 kilo bag for 5-8 francs. In addition, there are also export articles that cannot be bought anywhere else in Switzerland.\nL\u00e4derach produces their signature \"fresh chocolate\" as well as confectioneries.  They sell their products in a chain of stores in Switzerland.  Multiple stores are located at the Zurich main station, and another one is located right at the entrance of Bahnhofstrasse.\nThe larger Coop supermarkets carry many brands, including Lindt, Camille Bloch, Goldkenn, and others, including all sorts of alcohol-filled chocolates.\n\n\n==== Confectioneries ====\n Teuscher. \u2014 An upscale confiserie that specializes in truffles. There are three stores in Z\u00fcrich. \n4 Teuscher, Bahnhofstrasse 46, \u260f +41 44 211 13 90. \n5 Teuscher, Storchengasse 9, \u260f +41 44 211 5153. \n6 Teuscher (Globus), Schweizergasse 11, \u260f +41 44 211 5153. \n\nSpr\u00fcngli \u2014 A Zurich institution that offers a variety of sweet and savory goodies including a wide variety of chocolates, from handmade truffles to special chocolate bars. There are locations throughout the city, including Bahnhofstrasse and inside Zurich HB. Some specialities include the Luxemburgerli, a sort of soft macaroon resembling a hamburger in looks but is actually completely pastry and cream, and comes in a variety of flavors; the Truffe du Jour, a chocolate truffle that is made daily from raw cream and is meant to be consumed immediately; and the extraordinary Grand Cru Sauvage truffle, made from wild cacao beans from Bolivia. Most items are rather pricey but worth it. The flagship store on the Paradeplatz is a very popular spot for breakfast, lunch and afternoon tea. Try their berry-filled muesli, it's like no other muesli you've ever had. There are two handy stores at the Kloten airport for last-minute gifts to bring home.\n7 St. Jakobs Confiserie. Badenerstrasse 41. The background organisation, Behindertenwerk St. Jacob, aims at providing jobs for disabled people. \n\n\n=== Swiss handcrafts ===\n8 Schweizer Heimatwerk, Uraniastr 1 (on the river Limmat), \u260f +41 44 222 19 55. M-F 09:00-20:00, Sa 09:00-18:00. Also branches at the Bahnhofstrasse 2 and the airport. Quality Swiss handicrafts and other Swiss-made products presented in a gallery-like setting. You won't find many cuckoo clocks and the like here (cuckoo clocks are not really Swiss, they are from the Black Forest (Schwarzwald) in Germany!), the emphasis is on real traditional crafts and the work of modern craftspeople. You will find things like sleek modern hand-blown glassware and beautiful hand-carved wooden items from the Appenzell region. A worthwhile visit even if you just browse. (updated Apr 2017)\n\n\n=== Swiss army knives ===\nCoop City in Bahnhofstrasse sells the Victorinox line at uninflated prices, although you won't get additional bells and whistles like customized faceplates or engraving. Many other department stores also carry them.\nAny cutlery shop will probably carry both Victorinox and Wenger lines of products. However, do make sure they are not inflating the price. For example, a SwissChamp (possibly the most popular model) should be retailed around Fr. 78.\n\n\n=== Markets ===\n9 Flohmarkt B\u00fcrkliplatz (Fleamarket), B\u00fcrkliplatz (in the Bellevue area near the Stadelhofen station). May-Oct: Sa 06:00\u201315:30. Fairly relaxed yet large flea market with many interesting stalls. (updated Jan 2019)\n10 Flohmarkt Kanzlei (Fleamarket), Helvetiaplatz. Sa 08:00\u201316:00. A big flea market that hosts up to 400 stalls on busy days. \n\n\n=== Other ===\n11 Orell F\u00fcssli, F\u00fcsslistrasse 4, 8022 Z\u00fcrich (Tram 6, 7, 11, 13, 17 to \"Rennweg\"; a few hundred meters from Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof), \u260f +41 84 884 98 48, kundenservice@orellfuessli.ch. M-Fr 09:00-20:00; Sa 09-18:00; So off. Largest bookshop in Z\u00fcrich, including a large \"English Bookshop\" section on the third floor.   (updated Aug 2024)\n12 Sihlcity, Kalandergasse 1, 8045 Z\u00fcrich (Train S4 to \"Z\u00fcrich Saalsporthalle-Sihlcity\"), \u260f +41 44 204 99 99, info@sihlcity.ch. M-Sa 09:00-20:00; Su off. A good old fashioned shopping mall, which is a 5-minute S-Bahn ride away from the main station. It comprises some 100,000 m\u00b2 of rental space with a range of facilities, such as restaurants, a shopping center, a multiplex cinema, entertainment, health and fitness/wellness area, nightclub, a Four Points hotel and a chapel.   (updated Apr 2017)\n\n\n== Eat ==\n\nThe quintessential Z\u00fcrich dish is Z\u00fcrcher Geschnetzeltes (Swiss-German: Z\u00fcrigschn\u00e4tzlets), sliced veal in a cream and wine sauce. Various kinds of grilled wurst (sausages) are also popular. These are most often accompanied by boiled potatoes, r\u00f6sti, a Swiss potato pancake (grated potato, formed into a pancake then pan fried until crisp in butter or oil similar to hash browns) or chn\u00f6pfli, in German sometimes called Sp\u00e4tzle (small noodle dumplings).\nVeal is still very popular, though the use of turkey and other meats as a substitute is growing.\nWhile fondue (melted cheese in a central pot, dip bread into it) and Raclette (cheese melted in small portions, served with potatoes and pickles) are not really local to Z\u00fcrich (they come from Western Switzerland) they are commonly available at restaurants aimed at tourists. Swiss people usually eat those dishes at home and only during winter.\nThe bread available in Z\u00fcrich is generally delicious. There are many varieties, and your best bet is to go to a bakery or a supermarket in the morning or just after work hours, when most people are doing their shopping and bread is coming out fresh.\nTry grilled bratwurst from street stands, served with a large crusty roll of sourdough bread and mustard, or sandwiches made with fresh baked bretzeln (large, soft pretzels). A typically Swiss bread is the zopf, a braided soft bread that is commonly served on Sundays (the other name for it is Sonntagszopf).\nFor breakfast, try a bowl of m\u00fcesli, which was invented as a health food in Switzerland. The Spr\u00fcngli confectionery store tea rooms serve a deluxe version of this fiber-filled cereal with whole milk, crushed berries and cream.\nThere are a huge variety of cheeses available at the supermarkets, specialty stores and markets, as well as all kinds of hams and dried sausages. Dairy products are generally delicious, especially the butter. Do not miss the supermarkets! You should take a thorough look through Migros or Coop and maybe even assemble your own lunch or dinner some time. Even the cheap, budget prepackaged desserts in the supermarket exceed the quality of what you may be used to.\nFor those with a sweet tooth, there's a huge variety of chocolates to enjoy, from the cheapest chocolate bar to individually handmade truffles. (See the Shopping section above). The chocolate bar displays at the supermarkets will overwhelm you! Also enjoy pastries and cakes from the various Konditorei scattered around town. In pastry shops, you can also find special pastry from Zurich: The most famous of them is probably Tirggel, a rather hard pastry made of flour and honey. Although traditionally made and eaten during the Winter holidays, many pastry shops (including larger supermarkets) sell them throughout the year. Often, they've got sights of Zurich printed on the top, can be stored for months and thus make up a pretty good and cheap souvenir. Another famous type of pastry are Luxemburgerli exclusively sold by the confectionery chain of Spr\u00fcngli (part of the famous chocolatier Lindt & Spr\u00fcngli). A typical cake is the Mandelfisch, an almond cake shaped like a fish.\nLike most European cities, Z\u00fcrich abounds with caf\u00e9s where you can enjoy a leisurely cup of coffee, glass of wine or other beverage, and watch the world go by.\nThere are many international dining options available too. The current hot trend seems to be pan-Asian noodle, rice, and sushi places. However, due to the long distance from the sea and the lack of original, well-trained Chinese and Japanese cooks, the quality cannot live up to that of the original countries. Instead, the Italian cuisine holds the highest popularity among the foreign restaurants. They can be found throughout the city and are relatively cheap. Turkish fast food restaurants are also a delicious, cheap option.\nVegetarian food is easy to find throughout the city. Vegans may have a little trouble because cheese is used generously in most food, but should be fine living off supermarkets at the very least. Hiltl, the first vegetarian-only restaurant in Europe, is also worth a visit. You choose from the buffet, where your meal is priced by weight or from a variety of \u00e0 la carte menus, which are a bit more pricey, but include vegetarian/vegan versions of popular Swiss meals like Z\u00fcri-Gschn\u00e4tzlets or Beef Stroganoff amongst Indian food and classic vegetarian plates. Another vegan friendly restaurant is \"Bona Dea\", which is located directly at Zurich Mainstation.\n\n\n=== Budget ===\n\n\n==== City centre ====\n1 Rheinfelder Bierhalle, Niederdorfstrasse 76 (at the beginning of the Niederdorf, near Central), \u260f +41 44 251 54 64. In this huge and boisterous restaurant you get good value food and rich portions (only try the Jumbo Jumbo Cordon-Bleu when really hungry). Cheap beer. Service can range from very good to poor depending who is working that day. (updated Aug 2022)\n2 Pizzeria Molino, Limmatquai 16, \u260f +41 44 261 01 17. Pizzas and pastas in a relaxed setting.

(updated Aug 2022)\n6 Sternen Grill, Theaterstrasse 22. Zurich's most famous sausage stand near Bellevue tram stop. Red or white sausages for around Fr. 6 (Aug 2015), a piece of bread and (hot!) mustard is included. (updated Aug 2022)\n\n\n==== Neighborhood Langstra\u00dfe ====\n7 Gambrinus, Langstrasse 103 (near Helvetiaplatz). A typical Swiss restaurant with good food and cold beer. It is located in the Red Light District (Langstrasse) of Zurich and is not the ideal place to bring children or acquaintances. Gambrinus looks like a pub more than anything else, but the staff are friendly and speak English. Try the Z\u00fcrigschn\u00e4tzlets mit R\u00f6sti or the fondue (one of the best in town). From Fr. 14 (Aug 2015). (updated Aug 2022)\n8 Ah-Hua, Ankerstrasse 110 (next to Helvetiaplatz). Offers delicious Thai dishes to budget prices. Great pit-stop in a Langstrasse pub crawl. (updated Aug 2022)\n9 Bank, Molkenstrasse 15, \u260f +41 44 211 80 04. Restaurant, caf\u00e9, bar and bakery in old bank. Mostly organic and Mediterranean food.

Many guests were not too happy with the facilities and the friendliness of the owners. (updated Jul 2017)\n\n\n== Stay safe ==\n\nZ\u00fcrich, like all cities in Switzerland, is relatively safe. Nevertheless, be on guard for thieves and pickpockets. Carry your wallet or purse in a secure way, not in your hip pocket or a backpack outer pocket. In particular, thieves are known to operate around the Zurich main train station. Do not let your bags out of sight for even a moment.\nCertain areas along the lakefront are frequented by young people who sometimes try to pick a fight when they are drunk. Do not let them provoke you, as they are likely to be there in numbers and will use any excuse to go at you. You may also notice many of said young people smoking something that isn't a cigarette. Switzerland is surprisingly lenient about such things but it is hardly a cause for alarm.\nPublic transport is very safe. You can use it without any special precautions.\nIf you decide to bicycle in the city, understand that Zurich is a city of public transport. Beware of tram tracks which can get your wheel stuck and send you flying into traffic, of the trams themselves which travel these tracks frequently (and may scare you into getting stuck into the track), and the buses, which make frequent stops in the rightmost lane. In short, bicycling downtown should be only done by those experienced with cycling with such traffic.\n\n\n=== Gay and lesbian travellers ===\nBeing Switzerland's most liberal city (the socialist and green parties now fare extremely well here), Zurich is the favourite place to live for Switzerland's (German-speaking) gays and lesbians. The Canton of Zurich was the second canton, after Geneva, to allow registered partnerships for same-sex partners for example. The city of Zurich is probably the place in Switzerland that offers the most open environment for gays and lesbians. Gays and lesbians need not take special precaution for their safety on the streets. It is always possible for random homophobic behaviour to happen, though.\n\n\n== Connect ==\nAs of Sept 2021, the city has 5G from all Swiss carriers. WiFi is widely available in public places.\n\n\n== Cope ==\nPermanence Hauptbahnhof at the main train station provides urgent out-patient care for tourists without prior appointments. There is also a dentist downstairs at the station. For serious emergencies rush to the university hospital which has a 24/7 emergency ward. Tram stop \"ETH/Universit\u00e4tsspital\" (look out for the inexplicable golden boy statue in front of the building, then follow the red \"Notfall\" signs). They will not send away people with serious, urgent health problems. Ambulance phone number is 144 but the European 112 emergency number works as well.\nIf you're on a budget, don't stay out too late \u2014 the \"N\" night buses only run on weekends and only once per hour. On work nights, there is no public transport at all after about 00:30 (although expensive taxis still exist in case you're stuck).\nStores are generally closed on Sundays including all supermarkets in the city, except those in the main train station, some suburban stations, and at the airport which remain open.\nZurich has two police departments, the Stadtpolizei Zurich which is responsible for the city area and the Kantonspolizei Z\u00fcrich which is responsible for the whole region. With approximately 1,800 and 3,000 officers, these corps are the biggest in Switzerland. While police officers in Zurich will happily help you out if you are in trouble or need directions, they are also known for approaching \"suspicious\" persons in order to check their papers. This procedure is annoying but legal as you will probably have a hard time proving you were not acting suspicious. Carry a photocopy of your passport and your onward ticket with you, stay calm and polite and you're unlikely to have any trouble.\n\n\n== Go next ==\n\nSome interesting destinations nearby:\n\n Baden \u2014 This town is known for its castle ruin and the thermal baths. It takes 15 minutes by train to get there from Zurich.\nGreifensee \u2014 A lake and village next to the nearby town of Uster. The village of Greifensee is within a conservation area and very untouched.\nLucerne \u2014 Probably Switzerland's most popular destination. Go there to see the famous chapel bridge or the impressive transport museum.\nRapperswil \u2014 Located at the opposite end of lake Zurich. A small, picturesque town, good for a stroll. It is possible to go there by boat from Zurich.\nThe Rhine falls \u2014 Europe's largest waterfall. It is located near Schaffhausen, which has a nice old town in the Renaissance style.\nWinterthur \u2014 Around 25 minutes from Zurich, this city is worth a visit on a rainy day to visit some of its many museums. Technorama is the most popular one, an interactive science centre.\nA bit further away, but also worth a day trip:\n\nAppenzell \u2014 As close to the stereotypical image of Switzerland with wooden farm houses and traditional clothes as it gets. An interesting visit is the cheese factory, where the Appenzell cheese is made.\nAugusta Raurica \u2014 Close to Basel, this is one of the best preserved Roman sites north of the Alps.\nBellinzona \u2014 Since the opening of the new Gotthard tunnel in 2016, the Italian speaking part of Switzerland is less than two hours away by train. Go to Bellinzona to see its three castle, which are inscribed as a UNESCO world heritage site.\nBiel \u2014 Traditional watch making town. Visit the Omega factory to learn more about the watch industry.\nChur \u2014 Not only a nice city, but a good hub for hiking or skiing in the mountainous Graub\u00fcnden region.\nFribourg \u2014 Home town to the famous Swiss fondue. A good choice if you want to make a short trip into the French part of Switzerland.\nSolothurn \u2014 A small city on the river Aare noted for the giant cathedral and baroque old town."

        "title": "Hong Kong",
        "extract": "Hong Kong (\u9999\u6e2f H\u0113ungg\u00f3ng in Cantonese) is a place with multiple personalities. The population is mainly Chinese, but British influence is still quite visible. It has absorbed people and cultural influences from places as diverse as Vietnam and Vancouver and proudly proclaims itself to be Asia's World City.\nHong Kong is a global financial hub, and has been a major destination for tourists and business people from around the world for at least a century. Today it is also a major tourism destination for mainland China's increasingly affluent population.\nHong Kong is much more than a harbour city with crowded streets: this territory with its cloudy mountains and rocky islands also offers rural landscapes with breathtaking views. Much of the countryside is classified as Country Park and, although 7.4 million people (2021) are never far away, it is possible to find pockets of wilderness that will reward the more intrepid traveller.\nHong Kong has a subtropical climate with at least one season to match your comfort zone. Boasting one of the world's best airports, it is the ideal first stop for those on their way deeper into China and further Asia.\n\n\n== Districts ==\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n== Understand ==\n\n\"Hong Kong\" translates from Cantonese as \"fragrant harbour\".\nAlthough part of China, Hong Kong operates as a Special Administrative Region under the slogan \"One Country, Two Systems\" with a high degree of autonomy, maintaining most laws and government structures from colonial times. Visa requirements, laws, currency, culture and language have a heritage from the time of British rule, so for most tourists Hong Kong feels like a different country. Hong Kong enjoyed many Western-style freedoms and many locals were proud of it. The ideals of a free and open society were firmly rooted here, but a significant degree of freedom was curtailed when the National Security Law was imposed in 2020 and Article 23 was implemented locally in 2024.\n\n\n=== History ===\nThe area of Hong Kong was incorporated into China during the Qin Dynasty in 214 BC. In 1841, Great Britain defeated China's then-ruling Qing Dynasty in the First Opium War, gaining possession of Hong Kong Island. After the defeat of China in the Second Opium War, the Kowloon Peninsula was ceded to Great Britain in 1860. The Opium War Museum is located across the border in Dongguan. The New Territories were leased to Great Britain in 1898 for a term of 99 years. Hong Kong was only a sparsely-populated backwater prior to the arrival of the British, but grew rapidly into one of the world's most densely populated areas following the establishment of a free port under British colonial rule.\nWhen World War II broke out, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill declared that Hong Kong was an \"impregnable fortress\". However owing to Britain's main war effort in Europe, Hong Kong was not given sufficient resources for its defence. After two weeks of fighting, Hong Kong was surrendered to the Japanese on 25 December 1941, and subject to a brutal occupation that lasted until the end of the war. Upon the resumption of British control, Hong Kong experienced an astonishingly swift post-war recovery.\nAfter the communists took control of mainland China in 1949, many Chinese people, especially businessmen, fled to Hong Kong to escape persecution by the government. The British government took a hands-off approach in Hong Kong, and allowed a high degree of economic freedom. Social problems persisted during the 1950s and 1960s, including the continuation of Communist-Nationalist conflict among residents, labour disputes, and widespread corruption. These problems, when combined with effects of the Cultural Revolution, culminated in the 1967 riots by communist rioters, with an aim to overthrow the British administration. The riots were eventually suppressed by the authorities, but they forced the colonial government to take measures of reform, such as cracking down on corruption.\nUnder reforms, businesses flourished in Hong Kong and its economy grew rapidly, earning it a place as one of the East Asian Tigers. Today, Hong Kong is an industrialised and developed economy, and is one of the world's most important financial centres.\n\nIn 1984 the Chinese and British Governments signed the Sino-British Joint Declaration, Britain agreeing to return Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty. On 1 July 1997 Hong Kong became a special administrative region (SAR) of the People's Republic of China. As Hong Kong was the last remaining British colony with a significant population and economic importance, the handover was deemed by many to be the \"end of empire\". In theory, Hong Kong enjoys autonomy in most matters except foreign affairs and defence.\nIn 2014, the Umbrella Protest was held to demand free elections for Hong Kong's chief executive. The Chinese government had proposed elections for the position, but would only allow candidates they had vetted to stand for election. The proposed amendments to the Basic Law (Hong Kong's equivalent of a constitution) were voted down by the pro-democracy legislators, meaning that the chief executive is still elected by an election committee with limited representation. The protests eventually died down without concessions from China, though there remain demands for more political autonomy, and even for independence from China. \nSimmering tensions eventually led to the breakout of massive and violent protests in June 2019. The protests began in opposition to a bill that would have allowed people to be extradited to mainland China to face criminal charges, but expanded into a wider anti-government movement, and continued even after the extradition bill was withdrawn. In response, the Chinese government imposed a sweeping national security law on Hong Kong in July 2020, outlawing many forms of speech and advocacy against the government. This crackdown has led to a massive brain drain, with many well-educated young professionals fleeing to Western countries, in particular the United Kingdom and Canada.\nHong Kong participates in some international organisations such as the WTO and APEC, and in international sports competitions under the name \"Hong Kong, China\" (\u4e2d\u570b\u9999\u6e2f).\n\n\n=== Orientation ===\nHong Kong Island (\u9999\u6e2f\u5cf6) is the place that many tourists regard as the main focus. The parade of buildings that make the Hong Kong skyline has been likened to a glittering bar chart over the waters of Victoria Harbour. To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the Kowloon waterfront opposite.\n\nThe great majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely packed on reclaimed land along the northern shore. This is the place to start if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past. Central (\u4e2d\u74b0) (formerly Victoria) is where you will find the machinery of government grinding away much as it always has done, except that Beijing, not London, is the boss that keeps a watchful eye. Seek a glimpse of Government House (\u9999\u6e2f\u79ae\u8cd3\u5e9c), which had been home to 25 British governors, and is now the official residence of the Chief Executive. Nearby, the Legislative Council (LegCo) continues to make the laws that govern the territory.\nRising up from Central is the Escalator and the Peak Tram. The famous 800-metre escalator passes through the hip district of Soho (\u8607\u8c6a) and takes you into the residential neighbourhood known as the Mid-Levels (\u534a\u5c71\u5340) because it is half-way up the mountain. Up top is Victoria Peak (\u592a\u5e73\u5c71), the tallest point on the island, where foreign diplomats and business tycoons compete for the best views of the harbour from some of the most expensive homes to be found anywhere. Most tourists do not go much further than the Peak Tram, but take a short walk to the top and you will escape the crowds and be rewarded with some of the best harbour views. It is worth investing in a good map from a bookshop in Central if you want to enjoy some of the superb footpaths that crisscross the island.\nThe southern side of the island has developed into an upmarket residential area with many large houses and expensive apartments with views across the South China Sea. The island's best beaches, such as Repulse Bay, are found here and visitors can enjoy a more relaxed pace of life than on the bustling harbour side of the island. Wan Chai and Causeway Bay are the most visited neighbourhoods on the northern side of the island.\nKowloon (\u4e5d\u9f8d) is the peninsula to the north of Hong Kong Island. With over 2.1 million people living in an area of less than 47 km\u00b2, Kowloon is one of the most densely populated places on the planet, and has a matching array of places to shop, eat and sleep. Tsim Sha Tsui (\u5c16\u6c99\u5480), the tip of the peninsula, is Kowloon's main tourist drag and has a mix of backpacker and high-end hotels. Further north, Mong Kok (\u65fa\u89d2) has a huge choice of shops and markets in an area of less than a square kilometre. Kowloon side, as it's often known, managed to escape some of the British influences that characterise the Hong Kong Island side. Kowloon real estate prices are the highest in the world, with multiple flats in West Kowloon setting world records with their multi-million dollar prices thanks to their panoramic views of Victoria Harbour.\nThe New Territories (\u65b0\u754c), so named when the British leased more land from China in 1898, lie north of Kowloon. Largely rural and often ignored by travellers who have little time to spare, the New Territories offers a diverse landscape that takes time to get to know. Mountainous country parks overlook New Towns that have a clinical form of modernity that has attracted many to move here. Public transport and taxis make this offbeat place surprisingly accessible. You will not find many idyllic villages, but once you get over the stray dogs and the ramshackle buildings you will doubtlessly find something that will surprise you and cause you to reach for your camera.\nThe Outlying Islands (\u96e2\u5cf6) are the islands (236 of them), islets and rocks in the seas around the territory. Lantau (\u5927\u5dbc\u5c71) is by far the largest of them and often considered its own district. The Hong Kong International Airport is built on landfill attached to Lantau. Lantau hosts some of the territory's most idyllic beaches, and major attractions such as Disneyland and the Ngong Ping cable car. Other islands include Lamma (\u5357\u4e2b\u5cf6), well known for its seafood, and Cheung Chau (\u9577\u6d32), a small island that used to be a pirates' den, but now attracts seafood aficionados, windsurfers and sunbathing day trippers.\n\n\n=== People ===\nThe majority of Hong Kong's population are Han Chinese (92%), mostly of Cantonese ancestry, though there are also sizeable numbers of other Chinese groups such as Chiuchao (Teochews), Shanghainese and Hakkas. A significant number of Indians, Pakistanis and Nepalis live here too; some are immigrants, though many have families that have lived in Hong Kong for several generations. White people, some of them expatriates, and some descended from British colonists, make up just under 1% of the population. Other smaller communities whose presence in Hong Kong dates back to colonial times include the Parsis and the Baghdadi Jews, though the latter are now far outnumbered by expatriate Jews from Israel and Western countries.\nHong Kong has a significant minority of Permanent Residents who are not PRC citizens, and are not ethnically Chinese, but are recognised as Hong Kong residents by the Basic Law. This includes descendants of British, Jewish and South Asian populations from the colonial era. They are eligible to apply for Chinese citizenship, but few have taken up this option.\nThe largest groups of non-Chinese immigrants are Filipinos, Indonesians and Thais, most of whom are employed as domestic helpers. On Sundays, being their day off, they congregate in their thousands \u2014 mostly Filipinas \u2014 in Central and Admiralty and spend the day there together, sitting talking, eating and drinking wherever there is free room. The territory is also home to a significant number of people hailing from Australia, Europe, Japan and North America, making it a truly international metropolis.\nDue to its history as part of that region, the local culture in Hong Kong is similar to that of Guangdong province. With over a century of British rule, the British have also left their mark, as have the other non-Chinese minorities who came here during the colonial period. As the city escaped the upheaval of the Cultural Revolution, Hong Kongers have maintained some aspects of traditional Chinese culture which have largely disappeared in the mainland.\nHong Kong has significant cultural differences from mainland China due to its heritage. The bulk of the population are descendants of ethnic Chinese who fled China and found safety in Hong Kong during the colonial era. Locals in Hong Kong have maintained many aspects of traditional Chinese culture that have been abandoned in the mainland, including religion, holidays, music, traditional writing and the official use of a regional language (Cantonese). British influences have also been incorporated into the local culture.\nContemporary Hong Kong is, for the most part, rather secular in daily life. The Chinese majority generally practises a mix of traditional Chinese folk religions and Buddhism. There are Hindus and Muslims, most of whom are South Asians. Christianity is followed by 10% of the population. Protestants in Hong Kong tend to be strongly conservative.\nWithin the 25 years after 1997, some policy changes have allowed a very large number of mainland citizens to visit or to move to Hong Kong (in addition to imported workers) \u2013 many fewer were allowed before the handover.\n\n\n=== Politics ===\n\nUnder the \"One Country, Two Systems\" arrangement, Hong Kong largely retains its governmental structure from colonial times, with separate executive, legislative and judicial branches.\nThe head of the executive branch is the chief executive, who leads an Executive Council composed of various cabinet secretaries. The legislative branch is the Legislative Council. The Court of Final Appeal, which is led by the Chief Justice, tops the judicial branch. Hong Kong retains a legal system based on English Common Law, as opposed to the Civil Law system used in mainland China.\nBoth the chief executive and 70 members of the legislature are elected by interest groups that are largely stacked with pro-Beijing loyalists. 20 members of the legislature are elected by popular vote, but nominations must be approved. The central government in Beijing is therefore effectively in control of the executive and legislative branches.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nHong Kong has a humid subtropical climate. Summers are usually hot and humid, lasting from June to September, with average highs of 32 \u00b0C (90 \u00b0F) and lows of 27 \u00b0C (81 \u00b0F). Some particularly hot days can see summer temperatures climb upwards to 34 \u00b0C (93 \u00b0F) and 29 \u00b0C (84 \u00b0F) at night. The humidity can make the summer temperatures feel much hotter, the apparent feels like temperature is typically around 38 \u00b0C (100 \u00b0F) during the day and 31 \u00b0C (88 \u00b0F) at night, but cases of extreme humidity and heat can make it feel like 46 \u00b0C (115 \u00b0F) and 38 \u00b0C (100 \u00b0F) at night. Such high feels like temperatures only need an air temperature of 36 \u00b0C (97 \u00b0F) with a dew point of 27 \u00b0C (81 \u00b0F).\nThe area, like most of southern China, is affected by typhoons, which usually occur between June and September, sometimes as late as October. They seldom halt local business for more than a day.\nWinters in Hong Kong are generally very mild, with temperatures usually in the range 10\u201320 \u00b0C (50\u201368 \u00b0F). Christmas in Hong Kong is warm compared to European countries. Chinese New Year is notorious for cold wet weather, because winter in Hong Kong tends to start out mild and dry and then turn cooler and wetter later.\nSpring in Hong Kong is from March to May and autumn is from September to November with an average temperature of around 20\u201325 \u00b0C (68\u201377 \u00b0F). Autumn is considered a more comfortable season as spring tends to be more humid and rainy.\nAlthough most buildings in Hong Kong have air conditioning to cope with the summer weather, winter heating is less common. During the coldest days, most locals wear more layers, even indoors. Some larger Chinese restaurants keep the air conditioning on during winter, though the temperature in air conditioned shopping malls stays the same regardless of season or weather outside.\n\n\n=== Holidays and festivals ===\n\nHalloween (\u842c\u8056\u7bc0). Halloween has grown rapidly in popularity, and many people dress up and party till late in the bars and nightclubs. Trick or treating is not common but most restaurants and shopping centres are decorated and have special programmes. For young adults and teenagers, Ocean Park and Disneyland are the places to be.\nChristmas (\u8056\u8a95\u7bc0). Christmas is celebrated Hong Kong style. The city is adorned using traditional Western decorations. Many shopping centres offer ample opportunities for children to meet Santa. Most shops and restaurants remain open. Higher-end restaurants will often have special Christmas meals, and these tend to book out way in advance. You should expect large crowds out shopping for the sales.\nNew Year's Eve (\u5143\u65e6\u9664\u5915). Hundreds of thousands of people out on the streets to celebrate the New Year. There are all-night services on the MTR, night-buses, and many taxis. Fireworks go off on the harbour front, attracting large crowds on both sides: Tsim Sha Tsui (Kowloon side) and Central (Hong Kong Island). The party hot-spots are Causeway Bay, Lan Kwai Fong and Tsim Sha Tsui. Many people dress up and attend private parties and others flock to the streets.\nChinese (Lunar) New Year (\u8fb2\u66c6\u65b0\u5e74). The most important festival for locals in Hong Kong. Many shops and restaurants close for the first 3-14 days. However, some department stores, supermarkets, and Western fast-food restaurants may remain open. The week or two leading up to the Chinese New Year, and the period from the 4th to the 15th day are good times to soak up the festive mood and celebratory events such as lion dances, fireworks, and parades.\nSpring Lantern Festival (\u6b63\u6708\u5341\u4e94/\u5143\u5bb5\u7bc0). This traditional Chinese festival in Victoria Park in Causeway Bay displays beautiful lanterns.\nChing Ming Festival (\u6e05\u660e\u7bc0). This festival in spring is also known as grave sweeping day. To show respect to the deceased, family members go to the grave of their ancestors to remove weeds and leaves around the grave area. Paper offerings such as fake money are also burned despite the Environmental Protection Department\u2019s disapproval.\nCheung Chau Bun Festival (\u9577\u6d32\u592a\u5e73\u6e05\u91ae). This festival on the tiny island of Cheung Chau features competitions with people climbing bun towers to snatch buns.\nTuen Ng Festival (\u7aef\u5348\u7bc0). This is a festival in memory of a national hero from the Spring and Autumn Period of Chinese history. Dragon boat races are typically held and glutinous rice dumplings, usually with pork fillings, are eaten by many.\nTin Hau Festival (\u5929\u540e\u8a95). Celebrates the birthday of Tin Hau (Mandarin: Mazu \u5abd\u7956), a traditional Chinese goddess popular among fishermen and sailors. Celebrations are held in the many Tin Hau temples throughout Hong Kong.\nHungry Ghost Festival (\u9b3c\u7bc0/\u76c2\u862d\u7bc0). This festival runs throughout the seventh month of the Chinese calendar. It is believed that the gates of hell open during this period and hungry ghosts are allowed to roam freely into our world. People perform various rites to appease the wandering ghosts. You can also see traditional performances such as Chinese opera which are held to appease these ghosts.\nMid-Autumn Festival/Moon Festival (\u4e2d\u79cb\u7bc0). This festival is celebrated on the fifteenth day of the eighth lunar month. Moon cakes which contain lotus seed paste and duck egg yolks are a popular delicacy. There is also an ice-cream version. Parts of Hong Kong will be festooned with decorative lanterns which set the night scene ablaze with colour.\nChung Yeung Festival (\u91cd\u967d\u7bc0). It is a day also known as Autumn Remembrance, which is similar to Ching Ming in spring, where families visit the graves of their ancestors to perform cleansing rites and pay their respects. As the weather cools down during this part of the year, it is a good time for hiking.\n\n\n=== Events ===\nHong Kong Rugby Sevens. This annual event brings many visitors from around the world to celebrate the most entertaining installment in the IRB Sevens Series. It is a giant three-day sell-out event that takes place between the last days of March and the beginning of April.\nHong Kong Summer Spectacular. Dragon Boat Race, music festivals, summer sales, as well as book exhibitions, Anime Fair, all in the hottest summer parties and coolest carnival.\nHong Kong Summer Pop Music Festival Every summer, the Hong Kong Summer Pop Music Festival gathers top musicians who bring spectacular performances.\nHong Kong Arts Festival, a month-long festival of international performances, is held in February and March.\nMan Literary Festival, a two-week English language festival with international writers as guests, is held in March.\nHong Kong International Film Festival, a three-week event, is held in late March to early April.\n\n\n=== Units of measure ===\nHong Kong's official system of measurement is metric, but both the traditional Chinese and British Imperial systems of measurements survive to some extent. In particular, the traditional Chinese system of weights continues to be widely used in wet markets, while the British square foot (\u5e73\u65b9\u544e/\u544e) is widely used in real estate advertisements.\nWhile mainland China metricated traditional Chinese units, Hong Kong continues to use the traditional versions of those units, meaning that one j\u012bn (\u65a4, g\u0101n in Cantonese) is 604.8 g in Hong Kong, not 500g like in mainland China. While the j\u012bn is now divided into 10 li\u01ceng (\u5169, l\u00e9uhng in Cantonese) in mainland China, it is still divided into 16 li\u01ceng in Hong Kong, meaning that the Hong Kong li\u01ceng is 37.8 g, and not 50g. Public weighing scales in wet markets are required by law to display traditional Chinese, British Imperial and metric units side by side.\n\n\n=== Read and watch ===\nIts quick rise as an economic power and unique mix of East and West has made Hong Kong an interesting destination to write about.\n\nMyself a Mandarin (Oxford in Asia), Austin Coates. These memoirs are entertaining episodes of the Englishman's time as a colonial magistrate.\nEast and West: China, Power, and the Future of Asia (Macmillan, 1998), Chris Patten.

The unrelated stories of two love-struck cops in Hong Kong with colourful and fast cinematography.\nThe World of Suzie Wong, 1960. A film based on the novel by Richard Mason, it is the fictional story of an expat's affair with a Chinese woman. The film has interesting footage of Hong Kong in the late 1950s.\n\n\n=== Visitor information ===\nDiscover Hong Kong website\n\n\n== Talk ==\nSee also: Cantonese phrasebook\nThe official languages of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region are Chinese and English.\nCantonese is the main language spoken by locals. The Hong Kong variant is mostly the same as in Guangzhou across the border, but tends to incorporate some English words and slang, which frequently sounds strange to other Cantonese speakers (like \"\u6211\u5514sure\u5f97\u5514\u5f97\", means \"I am not sure if it's okay\"). News broadcasts are in standard Cantonese. Like all Chinese languages, Cantonese is a tonal language and not easy for foreigners to master, although learning a few simple greetings will get you acquainted with locals much more easily. Most locals have no idea how to read Romanised Cantonese, so stick to Chinese characters for written communication.\n\nEnglish is a common second language, and is spoken fluently by most white-collar professionals and business people. However, English proficiency tends to be more limited among the average working class person, particularly outside the main tourist areas. While many people can understand written English pretty well, they may not necessarily be comfortable speaking it.\nGovernment offices are required by law to have English-speaking staff on duty. There are three terrestrial English language TV stations: TVB Pearl, ViuTVsix, and HKIBC. English-language films in cinemas are almost always shown with the original soundtrack and Chinese subtitles, though children's films, especially animations, are often dubbed into Cantonese. English in Hong Kong generally follows British spelling and vocabulary choices. \nEnglish street names are seldom used among local people and taxi drivers. Even a local who speaks English fluently may not know the English name. Before you go anywhere, ask hotel staff to write down the street names using Chinese characters.\nMost locals are not fluent in Mandarin, but can understand it to some degree. Mandarin has been compulsory in all government schools since the handover, and with the huge influx of mainland tourists, people in the tourist industry will often speak Mandarin. Most shops in the main tourist areas, as well as all government offices, will have Mandarin-speaking staff on duty. The use of Mandarin is a touchy issue, and some locals may refuse to speak Mandarin for political reasons. Even locals who speak Mandarin usually have a better command of English. If you don't speak Cantonese, it's generally better to try English first.\nAll official signs are bilingual in Chinese and English. Hong Kong continues to use traditional Chinese characters, and not the simplified Chinese characters used in the mainland.\nSome of Hong Kong's older residents may speak other dialects such as Hakka, Teochew and Shanghainese, but they are generally able to speak Cantonese as well. You may also hear other languages among Hong Kong's non-Chinese minorities, but people in these groups generally know English, and often Cantonese as well. \nHong Kong Sign Language (HKSL, \u9999\u6e2f\u624b\u8a9e) is the language of the deaf community. It is mutually intelligible with Macau Sign Language, and more distantly related to Chinese Sign Language used in the mainland, not mutually intelligible with it.\n\n\n== Get in ==\n\n\n=== Immigration ===\nHong Kong maintains a separate immigration system from that of Mainland China. Citizens of most Western countries do not need a visa to visit Hong Kong. The Hong Kong visa can be applied for at a Chinese diplomatic mission, but must be done so separately from the Mainland Chinese one; there is no single visa that serves both areas. A visa is required to enter Mainland China from Hong Kong and vice versa. Macau is also a separate jurisdiction with regards to visas. If you wish to re-enter Mainland China after visiting Hong Kong, make sure you have a multiple-entry Chinese visa.\nSee Entry requirements to Hong Kong for a list of visa requirements or visa-free stays by country of citizenship. All holders of an APEC Business Travel Card can use the counters for Hong Kong residents at immigration control and can stay for up to 60 days in Hong Kong visa-free if their card has 'HKG' printed on the reverse.\nForeign nationals who cannot enter visa-free, want to remain for longer than permitted by their visa exemption, or want to work, study or establish/join a business, can apply for one at a Chinese embassy or consulate, or directly through the Hong Kong Immigration Department. Those living in Macau can apply for a visa at the Office of the Commissioner of the Chinese Foreign Ministry. Those living in Mainland China may apply at the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Shanghai, or at the Office of the Government of the Hong Kong SAR in Beijing.\n\nMainland Chinese citizens who reside in the mainland must obtain a card-styled entry permit (\u5f80\u4f86\u6e2f\u6fb3\u901a\u884c\u8b49). They cannot use their passports to enter Hong Kong unless they are in transit to/from a foreign country. Mainland Chinese citizens may use their passport or Taiwan Travel Permit (\u5f80\u6765\u53f0\u6e7e\u901a\u884c\u8bc1) to transit through Hong Kong, in which case they may visit for up to seven days. Mainland Chinese citizens who reside overseas may also apply for an Entry Permit of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region at a Chinese diplomatic mission, and use their passport with such an entry permit to enter Hong Kong.\nHolders of Macau permanent identity cards or Visit Permits with permanent resident status can enter Hong Kong visa-free for up to 180 days. Holders of Macao Visit Permits without permanent resident status can enter Hong Kong visa-free for up to 30 days. See Visit/Transit Arrangements to Hong Kong for Macao Residents for more details. Though they can be used when leaving Macau, Macau digital identity cards are not accepted by Hong Kong immigration, and the physical one must be presented when entering Hong Kong.\nCitizens of Taiwan are granted visa-free access to Hong Kong for 30 days if they have a Mainland Travel Permit/Taiwan Compatriot Pass (Taibaozheng, \u53f0\u80de\u8b49). Otherwise, a pre-arrival registration is required which can be applied for through the Immigration Department. See Arrangements for Entry to Hong Kong for Overseas Chinese and Chinese residents of Taiwan for more details. \"Chinese residents of Taiwan\" refers to citizens of Taiwan.\nHolders of British National (Overseas) (BNO) passports cannot use these passports to enter Hong Kong and should instead use their Hong Kong passport, Hong Kong ID card, or Hong Kong document of identity when passing immigration and during their stay in Hong Kong.\nIndian nationals do not require a visa, however they need to submit a pre-arrival registration (PAR) form. The PAR is valid for six months from date of issue / registration and allows for multiple entries during the validity period, each for a maximum of 14 days. A visit to Macau and back shall be considered a new entry and restarts the 14 day clock. However visitors may be subject to enquiries by the immigration officials during the re-entry about the purpose & reason for re-entry. \nExpiry of the limit of stay is counted from the day after the date of entry. For example, if you have a 7-day visa and arrive on January 1, you are allowed to stay until January 8. If you are arriving late at night, you may want to wait until after midnight to clear immigration. Likewise, you may be able to clear immigration just before midnight on the last day that your visa is valid and then take a flight or boat in the middle of the night on the next day. For more information, see question #11 of the Visa FAQs.\nHong Kong no longer issues passport stamps, and visitors are instead given an entry slip with their terms of entry. All entries and exits are recorded electronically as well.\nCitizens of Afghanistan, Angola, Bangladesh, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Cote d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Eswatini, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Iran, Iraq, Liberia, Libya, Nepal, Nigeria, North Korea, Pakistan, Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Sudan, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Syria, Togo and Yemen are required to obtain a transit visa even if they are only changing flights at Hong Kong International Airport without needing to pass through immigration and customs.\n\n\n==== e-Channel ====\nRegular visitors can register to use the e-Channel to avoid the queues by going through an automated barrier which uses fingerprint recognition technology. You may be eligible to use e-Channel if you are a Macau resident, are a mainland Chinese citizen holding holding a valid entry permit, or have a biometric passport issued by Australia, Germany, Singapore, South Korea or Thailand, and have visited Hong Kong at least twice in the past 24 months. You can also enroll on the basis of membership in some frequent flyer programmes (some of which require you to possess status in their upper tiers).\nHong Kong permanent residents can use e-Channels labelled for visitors if the gates for permanent residents are congested.\n\n\n=== Customs ===\nIf you are carrying goods that are banned or more than your allowance, you must declare them at the Red Channel when you enter Hong Kong \u2014 even when travelling from Mainland China, Macau or Taiwan:\n\nMeat and eggs, animal products, fish, rice (exceeding 15 kg)\nOzone depleting substances, items with forged trade marks, radio communication transmitting apparatus\nSmokeless tobacco, e-cigarettes, and herbal cigarettes\nCannabidiol (CBD) is banned in Hong Kong. Offenders face a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.\nPepper sprays and tasers are prohibited in Hong Kong even for transit visitors \u2014 while first-time offenders might receive a warning or fine (and the items confiscated), authorities can still charge you for unlawful possession of arms, a serious offence punishable for 14 years imprisonment.\nA traveller aged 18 or above is allowed to bring into Hong Kong \u2013 for their own use \u2013 as part of their duty-free allowance:\n\n1 litre of alcoholic liquor with an alcoholic strength above 30% by volume measured at a temperature of 20 \u00b0C\n19 cigarettes or 1 cigar or 25 g of cigars or 25 g of other manufactured tobacco\nIf the traveller holds a Hong Kong Identity Card, they must have spent 24 hours or longer outside Hong Kong to benefit from the duty-free allowance relating to alcoholic liquor.\nThe Hong Kong government restricts the amount of baby milk powder formula that may be taken out of the territory to no more than 1.8 kg. Violation of this restriction could lead to fines and imprisonment.\nFor more information, visit the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department website.\n\n\n=== By plane ===\n\n\n==== Hong Kong International Airport ====\nMain article: Hong Kong International Airport\n\nHong Kong International Airport (HKG IATA), also known as Chek Lap Kok \u8d64\u9c72\u89d2, is on Lantau Island in the west of Hong Kong. The airport's article provides details on airlines that fly here, and on transportation from the airport to the city by the MTR Airport Express train, public bus, taxis. Taxis are expensive for single travellers and pairs because of the distance and tolls for harbour tunnel crossings. Taxis are often slow because of downtown traffic.\n\n\n==== Shenzhen International Airport ====\nAs flights between Hong Kong and mainland China are treated as international flights, it is often cheaper to fly to Shenzhen Airport (SZX IATA), in the nearby mainland Chinese city of Shenzhen.\nTo travel between Shenzhen Airport and Hong Kong:\n\nDirect buses operate between the airport and the Elements Shopping Mall, above the Kowloon MTR station. You can check-in and receive your boarding pass (except for China Southern Airlines passengers) at the check-in desk on the 1st floor of the shopping centre, opposite Starbucks. This in-town check-in is completely separate from the in-town check-in provided for Hong Kong International Airport. The cost of the service is $100 and the bus is advertised to take 75 minutes, but it usually takes 100 minutes. Buses run every 30 minutes from 6:30AM to 7PM from Hong Kong and from 10AM to 9PM from Shenzhen.\nFrom Fuyong Ferry Terminal at Shenzhen Airport one can buy ferry tickets to Hong Kong. Passengers who need to transfer between flights at Hong Kong and Shenzhen airports can use the ferry service to/from Hong Kong airport without having to pass through Hong Kong immigration.\nA cheaper way is to take Shenzhen Metro Line  11  from the airport to Futian in central Shenzhen (29 minutes, \u00a57). From here, you can connect to the High Speed Rail direct to West Kowloon in downtown Hong Kong (15 minutes, $80). Even cheaper is taking Shenzhen Metro Line  10  to \"Futian Checkpoint\" (10 minutes, \u00a52) (called Lok Ma Chau on the Hong Kong side) or Shenzhen Metro Line  1  to \"Luohu\" (20 minutes, \u00a54) (Lo Wu on the Hong Kong side), then pass through a long corridor and an international border gate (have visa ready) and once in Hong Kong, hop on the  East  Rail suburban rail line to central Hong Kong (45 minutes, $35).\n\n\n==== Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport ====\nGuangzhou Baiyun International Airport is a bit further away than Shenzhen, but has more flights and with direct coach connections to Hong Kong.\n\n\n==== Macau International Airport ====\nIt is also often cheaper to fly into Macau International Airport (MFM IATA). Air Asia has a hub at Macau from where it operates service to Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok, and Chiang Mai, among other cities.\nTo travel between Macau Airport and Hong Kong:\n\nWith the Express Link service, you can transfer directly from airport to ferry (or vice versa) without going through Macau immigration. $70 from Hong Kong (with baggage being checked in there) or $50 to Hong Kong, excluding the ferry ticket cost.\nIf you don't need a visa for Macau, the cheaper way is to clear Macau immigration and to go yourself to Macau Taipa Ferry Terminal just to the north from the airport. Outside of the airport, take a bus MT1 or 26 from \"Rotunda de Aeroporto / Wai Long\" bus stop, and get out at the terminal (normally the next stop). The ticket price is HK$4.2 or MOP4.2. From the airport, it's wise to get some change before taking this bus, and both the ATMs normally dispense both Hong Kong dollars and Macanese pataca, and the local shops accept the former in lieu of the latter (at 1:1 rate). You may get coins of both currencies as a change. It would take around 20 minutes to walk to the ferry terminal. If coming from Hong Kong, choose Cotai Water Jet ferry to get to Macau Taipa Ferry Terminal.\nthe AP1 bus will transport you to Macau Outer Ferry Terminal, but the bus trip will take longer as it will have to cross to the mainland part of Macau.\nThose having a few hours to spare in Macau and not much baggage may choose to take one of the buses going to one of the casinos (Venetian, Sands, etc.) waiting both near the airport and the Macau Taipa Ferry Terminal, spend some time there, then return to either ferry terminal or the airport using a similar bus. These buses are free of charge.\n\n\n=== By helicopter ===\n Sky Shuttle. A helicopter service several times a day from the Terminal Mar\u00edtimo in Macau to the Shun Tak Heliport (HHP  IATA) at the Hong Kong-Macau Ferry Pier in Sheung Wan, Hong Kong Island. The trip takes 15 minutes and one-way fares cost $4,300. (updated Jul 2024)\n\n\n=== By train ===\nSee also: Rail travel in China\n\nMultiple frequent high-speed trains connect Hong Kong with Shenzhen and Guangzhou every day, with one daily long-distance service each from Beijing and Shanghai.  MTR High Speed runs some high-speed passenger services up to Guangzhou under the Vibrant Express brand, while CRH (the high-speed branch of China Railways) operates the remaining short-distance trains and all the long-distances ones. It takes 23 minutes from Shenzhen, 48 minutes from Guangzhou, 8\u00bd hours from Shanghai and 8 hours 10 min from Beijing on the daytime trains. Overnight high-speed sleeper services from Shanghai and Beijing run four times a week, taking 10 h 55 min and 11 h 27 min respectively. The line runs underground in Hong Kong, so don't expect to see any sights. High-speed rail is now your only option for travelling by train directly from the mainland.\nServices on this line go to the 1 West Kowloon Station . This station is huge, although most of its footprint is underground. There is a food court (important as many shorter services don't have a dining car, including all Vibrant Express trains), as well as other facilities such as a business lounge and public waiting spaces. It is connected to Austin station on  Tuen Ma  line and Kowloon station on the  Tung Chung  and  Airport  lines, and to a bus terminal.\nThe station has several levels:\n\nBoth Mainland and Hong Kong immigration and customs are co-located at this station. The station's Mainland Port Area is under Mainland China's jurisdiction, and is demarcated by a yellow line. When you clear immigration to board a train at West Kowloon, you are subject to Mainland Chinese law. Chinese Internet censorship doesn't apply to the Mainland Port Area, as mobile internet service is provided by Hong Kong operators.\nYou can travel by a wider range of high-speed trains and overnight sleepers from many Chinese cities to Shenzhen, and then change to the Metro or another high-speed rail train to reach Hong Kong. Shenzhen railway station is adjacent to the Lo Wu/Luohu border crossing.\n\n\n=== By ferry ===\n\nHong Kong is a one-hour hydrofoil ride away from Macau and there are also good connections from mainland China. If you plan to only visit Zhuhai, a visa-on-arrival is available at the Jiuzhou Ferry Terminal for up to 3 days. The main terminals are:\n\nOperating to 2 Hong Kong-Macau Ferry Terminal , 202 Connaught Rd (Sheung Wan MTR exit D) in Central.\nTurboJet, every 5\u201330 minutes, 24 hours a day from Macau.\nCotai Jet, every 15\u201330 minutes, 24 hours a day from Taipa, Macau.\nOperating to 3 Hong Kong China Ferry Terminal , 33 Canton Rd (Tsim Sha Tsui MTR exit A1) in Kowloon.\nChu Kong Passenger Transport, from Zhuhai and various other points in mainland China's Guangdong Province.\nTurboJet, every 30 minutes from Macau.\nXunlong from Shekou in Shenzhen, mainland China.\nIf you're flying into Hong Kong airport to reach Macau or other cities in the Pearl River Delta, see Hong Kong International Airport for direct ferry options that skip Hong Kong immigration.\n\n\n=== By cruise ship ===\n4 Kai Tak Cruise Terminal  is a newer terminal that opened on the site of the former Kai Tak Airport runway. The terminal supports two large ship berths. Known to be notoriously deserted with few shops, the terminal has limited access to public transportation, although there are free shuttle services to nearby shopping and public transportation when cruise ships arrive.\n5 Ocean Terminal  is the old cruise ship terminal in Tsim Sha Tsui, which is well connected to public transportation and shopping malls.\nCheck with your cruise line before you travel to find out which terminal your ship berths at.\n\n\n=== By bridge ===\n\nThe 50-km Hong Kong\u2013Zhuhai\u2013Macau Bridge (HZMB), a bridge and tunnel opened in October 2018, was one of the largest construction projects in the world. The link makes it possible to travel quickly across the Pearl River Delta without taking the ferry.\nFrequent HZMBus shuttle buses departing up to every 5 minutes, 24 hours a day are available to cross the HZMB. They take around 40 minutes, and tickets can be purchased with Octopus or AliPay from ticket machines, as well as cash and credit cards at the ticket desk at the 6 HZMB Hong Kong Kong Port. The Hong Kong Port can be reached by taxis or various buses including CityFlyer airport (A number) routes, or the B5 shuttle bus from Sunny Bay MTR station, or the B6 bus from Tung Chung. Once arriving at the 7 HZMB Macau Port you can take taxis or the 101X bus, the 102X bus to St Paul's and Taipa, or the HZMB Integrated Resort Connection bus (free) to Taipa Ferry Terminal or the Exterior Ferry terminal to connect to the free casino shuttle buses. Once arriving at the HZMB Zhuhai Port, you can take taxis or the L1 bus which uses historic tourist vehicles, or the 12, 23 or 25 buses to continue your journey in the mainland. If you are flying to Hong Kong to get to Macau, there is also a bus service that allows you to bypass Hong Kong customs and immigration.\nTo drive across the bridge, you must apply for a permit from the mainland government if travelling to Zhuhai or three separate permits (one from each of the Hong Kong, Macau, and mainland governments) to drive to Macau.\n\n\n=== By other land crossings ===\nShenzhen is the Chinese city that borders Hong Kong. See China#Get in for information on visa requirements. \nThere are 8 land checkpoints between Hong Kong and mainland China. Be sure to note the opening hours of the border crossing before starting your journey. If you are driving across the border, you must have a set of plates issued by each of China and Hong Kong. You will have to change sides of the road at the border because people in Hong Kong drive on the left, and people in mainland China drive on the right.\nCross-boundary coaches travel to Hong Kong from several cities in mainland China and are usually easier than crossing the border via several transfers and several modes of transportation. For information on these bus services, see the website of each border crossing listed below. Other than the Shenzhen Bay Bridge and the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge, these crossings are within the frontier closed area, meaning it's illegal to head there without a permit unless you are crossing the border.\n\n\n=== By bicycle ===\nYou cannot cycle across the border into Hong Kong from mainland China. However, you can bring a bicycle from Shenzhen into Hong Kong by following one of these procedures:\n\nYou can bring a bicycle across the border at Lo Wu Control Point, then board the MTR East Rail train. Bicycles are allowed on the train after paying a fee between $20 and $40, depending on the time of day, and provided the front wheel is removed. You can alight at Sheung Shui station and continue the rest of your journey by bicycle if you wish.\nGMB minibus #75 operates between the Lok Ma Chau Spur Line Control Point and Yuen Long for $10 and allows a folded bike with 50 cm wheels. While most passengers take the bus to an urban area, it is possible for bikers to alight just outside the Frontier Closed Area (costing $6) and continue the rest of the journey by bicycle. Buses are known to be crowded, there is not much luggage space on this bus, and you may be required to disassemble your bike.\n\n\n== Get around ==\nHong Kong has an excellent and cheap public transport system. Unlike in mainland China, Google Maps can be used in Hong Kong.\nHong Kong has the world's highest use of public transport, with over 90% preferring the mode. However, you cannot use China's China T-union card as a payment for public transport in Hong Kong: you must have an Octopus Card, a prepaid card to pay for public transport within Hong Kong. Joint Octopus-T-Union cards are also available, which allows you to use the card in most major mainland Chinese cities as well.\n\n\n=== Octopus card ===\nThe Octopus Card (\u516b\u9054\u901a, Bat Dat Toong in Cantonese) is a prepaid card that can be used to pay for public transportation such as the MTR, trains, trams, buses, mini-buses, and ferries. Most taxis do not yet accept it although more will in future. Paying for public transport with an Octopus Card is usually at a discounted fare (not the case though for buying a return Airport Express ticket).\nIt can also be used to pay for items in convenience stores, supermarkets, fast food restaurant chains, many vending machines, all roadside parking and some car parks. It can also be used as a building access card. Some chain stores, such as Wellcome, offer discounts for paying with the Octopus Card. This is a great way to avoid carrying and counting coins.\nA tourist Octopus card costs $150 and includes $111 in stored value plus a $39 non-refundable deposit. It is a sold version of the card and can be purchased conveniently from the Octopus vending machine at the arrival hall of Hong Kong International Airport. The remaining balance can be refunded and the card will be disabled. The card itself can be retained by the visitor as a souvenir.\nThe maximum value an Octopus card can carry is $3,000. The credit on the card can go negative. For example, you may pay for a ride costing $5 with only $2 of remaining value on the card (bringing the stored value to \u2212$3) but you cannot use the card again until the value is topped up. The value of an Octopus card can go as low as \u2212$35. That isn't really \"negative\", meaning you don't have to pay MTR back, since your $50 deposit secures it.\nYour Octopus card's balance is displayed on the reader after each use. The balance can also be checked, along with the last nine transactions, using a small machine near regular ticket machines at MTR stations.\nIt is simple and convenient to top up your Octopus Card:\n\n\"Add Value\" machines, usually next to regular ticket machines in MTR stations. Top-Ups in these machines can be made in multiple of $50 and only in cash.\nCustomer service centres at all MTR stations\nSome merchants that accept Octopus (e.g. 7-Eleven, McDonald's, Wellcome, etc.). This is the best way to avoid queues at the MTR station.\nOctopus for Tourists App\nTop-ups are generally possible in multiples of $50 only.  The Octopus for Tourists app allows for top-up in multiples of $1 but with a higher minimum of $100.  \nA joint Octopus-China T-Union Card can be used in most major cities across China (notable exceptions include Wuhan and Hohhot).\n\n\n==== MTR Fare Saver Machines ====\nThere are several fare saver machines across the MTR system. By tapping your Octopus Card at the reader on one of such machines, you will receive a $1\u20132 discount on your same-day next MTR journey if such a journey originates from one of the stations indicated on that machine.  However, only one such machine services many of the indicated stations, and are often far away from the indicated stations.  Tsim Sha Tsui and East Tsim Sha Tsui are tricky cases: the machine at The Gateway at Harbour City offers the discount for the former but not the latter, whilst the machine at the Peninsula Centre offers the discount for both.\n\n\n=== By Mass Transit Railway ===\n\nHong Kong's Mass Transit Railway (MTR) is the fastest way to get around, but it does not offer the views of buses and trams. It is clean, safe, reliable and efficient. There are 5 underground lines, 4 suburban rail lines, the Airport Express, and a network of modern light rail lines in the Northwest New Territories.\nThe most important lines for many visitors are \n\nThe busy Tsuen Wan Line (red), which runs from Central to Kowloon via tunnel and then down Nathan Road towards Tsuen Wan in the New Territories,\nThe Island Line (blue) which runs along the north coast of Hong Kong Island.\nThe Tung Chung Line (orange) is the fastest ways to get to Lantau. This line can also be used to change to the Disneyland Resort Line (pink) at Sunny Bay, which is also the station catch a shuttle bus to take you to the Hong Kong port for those who want to travel by another bus to Macau. All signs are in both Chinese and English and all announcements are made in Cantonese, Mandarin, and English. Staff in the station control room usually speak enough English to be able to help lost tourists.\nThe South Island Line can also be used to visit Ocean Park.\nThe East Rail Line which takes you to New Territories and contains First Class coaches.\nThe Airport Express line goes directly from the Hong Kong MTR station to the HK International Airport Terminal 1, and costs $110. A cheaper way to get to and from the airport is to take the S1 bus from the airport to the Tung Chung MTR station (~$4) and then the Tung Chung line to the Hong Kong MTR station (~$24) and vice versa. This costs about 1/4th the price of the Airport Express line.\nIn Cantonese, the East Rail line is colloquially referred to as \u706b\u8eca (f\u00f3 ch\u0113), alluding to its origins as an intercity railway, while the other lines are referred to as \u5730\u9435 (dei tit).\nConsiderations when using the MTR:\n\nThe MTR system is linked to two border crossings with mainland China, at Lo Wu Control Point and Lok Ma Chau Spur Line Control Point, both on the East Rail Line. You exit the fare gates into the Hong Kong immigration hall, then cross a bridge over the Sham Chun River into the mainland Chinese immigration hall. Once you have cleared mainland Chinese immigration and customs, a station on the Shenzhen Metro is only a short walk away, and directions are well-signposted in both Chinese and English. As Lo Wu and Lok Ma Chau stations are in a restricted area, it is illegal to take the train to these stations without a permit unless you are crossing the border.\nRides on East Rail line First Class, the Airport Express, and to/from Lo Wu/Lok Ma Chau follow a separate fare structure. MTR system promotions (including the tourist day pass, and the fare saver machines) do not extend to these services.\nThe East Rail Line offers a first class car where the seats are wider and more comfortable. The fare is twice that of the regular cars on the same route, and you must buy a separate ticket at a station's ticketing office or validate your Octopus card before entering. Ticket inspectors conduct regular patrol in the carriage and passengers without a valid first class ticket or validated Octopus card may be fined up to $500.\nIn Hong Kong, the English name for the underground metro system is the 'MTR'. The term 'Subway' refers to underground walkways, as opposed to the metro system. 'Metro' or 'Underground' are not commonly understood by local people either.\nFares depend on distance. Credit cards cannot be used to buy tickets on most vending machines.  However you can tap contactless Visa, Mastercard or UnionPay credit cards (or Apple or Android pay devices linked to one of those) at the MTR fare gates to pay fares. Visa and Mastercard may also be used to top up Octopus cards via the Octopus for Tourists App.\nMainland Chinese visitors can also pay fares using Alipay and WeChat Pay. Just look for a faregate that is equipped with a QR code scanner, which you can use to scan the Alipay or WeChat Pay QR code on your smart phone.\nTsim Sha Tsui on the Tsuen Wan line and East Tsim Sha Tsui on the Tuen Ma line are\nconsidered one station for purposes of fare calculation and transfers. But to transfer from one line to the other on those stations without incurring additional costs, you must tap out from one station and tap in within 30 minutes to the other.\n\nConsumption of food and drinks and smoking are strictly forbidden in the paid area of stations and in trains. Offenders are liable to a fine of up to $2,000.\nAlways stand on the right when using escalators to allow people to pass on the left. Hong Kongers do not shove or jostle for seats as is common in mainland Chinese Metro systems.\nDisabled Access and Stroller Access is provided at the MTR stations, but you may have to walk a long way: the lift may be at one end of a platform at train level, whilst the lift to street level will be at the other end. There is usually one designated fare reader for wider (wheelchair/stroller) access, but often it is a long walk around the station or platform. Occasionally, there will be an MTR staff booth at a set of gates, but they may or may not tap your card on their terminal and let you through the goods entrance to the platform. It may be better to collapse your stroller, pick up your child and use the escalators and regular fare readers. A small, lightweight, upright folding stroller will be easier to use on transit.\nSome adjacent stations are served by the same two lines (e.g. Central and Admiralty on the Tsuen Wan and Island lines; Yau Ma Tei, Mong Kok, and Prince Edward on the Kwun Tong and Tsuen Wan lines).  However some of these stations offer quicker and more convenient cross-platform interchanges than others depending on the direction of transfer.  Watch the flashing system maps on the train and listen to the announcements to know which of the stations are convenient for the transfers you wish to make.\n\n\n=== By tram ===\n\nOperated by Hong Kong Tramways, the narrow double-decker city trams (also known locally as \"ding ding\") trundling along the northern coast of Hong Kong Island have provided cheap transport for over a century. Riding the tram is a great and cheap way to sightsee. For an excursion lasting 1 hour, board at the Kennedy Town Terminus and get a good seat on the upper deck. As the tram travels eastward, you will have an elevated view of Hong Kong Island and its different flavours, from bustling Hong Kong street life to its glitzy financial and shopping districts and, finally, a taste of the local residential areas.\n\nTrams are not air conditioned. Summer months can be very uncomfortable even with the windows open.\nThey run 6AM-midnight.\nPassengers board at the rear and a flat $3 fare is paid when getting off at the front of the tram. The fare is paid for by Octopus Card, coins (no change given) or contactless Visa/Mastercard (including Apple Pay and Google Pay). Using a contactless Visa provides a $1 discount.  There are two readers - one for Octopus Card and the other for contactless Visa/Mastercard, so if you are using Apple Pay with both an Octopus Card and Visa/Mastercard, be careful to tap your device on the correct reader.\nIt is the favourite means of transportation for Hong Kong's large foreign domestic helper community on Sundays (their normal day-off) and may get crowded on that day.\n\n\n=== Peak Tram ===\nThe Peak Tram, Hong Kong's first mechanised mode of transport, opened in 1888. The remarkably steep 1.7-km track from Central up to Victoria Peak is worth at least one trip despite the comparatively steep price ($62 one-way, $88 return; return tickets must be purchased in advance). The tram turnstiles take Octopus cards.\nThe Peak Tram is likely to be crowded at night when the view of the city's skyline is magic, and on public holidays. Queues can be very long (waiting an hour is common at busy times), and a lot of pushing has been reported.\nThe tram is not the only way to get to the Peak, and there are cheaper (but slower and still quite scenic) alternatives such as the #1 green minibus costing $10.2, and the #15 double-decker bus costing $10.3 from Exchange Square Bus Terminus. These buses will often give you great views of both sides of Hong Kong Island on the way up.\n\n\n=== Light rail ===\n\nMTR operates a tram system in the northwest New Territories called Light Rail. It is a modern and fast tram system connecting Tuen Mun, Yuen Long, and Tin Shui Wai. It uses a proof-of-payment fare system, in which passengers are required to buy a ticket or tap an Octopus card at the station entrance before boarding and there are no fare gates, but ticket inspection is random. The area is seldom visited by foreign tourists but various sights are nonetheless accessible via Light Rail, such as numerous ancient walled villages (highlighted by the Ping Shan Heritage Trail), the Hong Kong Wetland Park, the beaches of Tuen Mun New Town, Yuen Long Town Centre, and seafood towns like Lau Fau Shan and Sam Shing.\n\n\n=== By bus ===\n\nThere are three types of buses available in Hong Kong. In city centre, buses will get stuck in traffic and take much longer than the MTR. However, they cover many more destinations than the MTR. While generally easy to use, signs in English can be sparse and finding your bus stop can get difficult. Buses are also the only public option in some areas. Google Maps, Apple Maps, or City Mapper will let you know the best bus route to take from your current position to destination (if necessary, they will combine it with MTR rides too).\nDouble-decker buses are used on most routes and cover practically the entire territory, stop frequently and charge varying fares depending on the distance. The first seats of the upper deck offer great views.\nThe franchised bus operators in Hong Kong include Kowloon Motor Bus (KMB) (and its subsidiary Long Win Bus), Citybus (CTB) and New Lantau Bus (NLB). Route and fare information can be found on their company websites. Alternatively it is also wise to install transportation apps such as \"App 1933\" and \"CitybusNWFB\" into your smartphone to check fares outdoors if you use mobile devices regularly during your stay.\nThe resort towns of Discovery Bay and Ma Wan have separate bus services provided by their real-estate developers, namely Discovery Bay Transportation Services and Park Island Transport.\nFares depend more on where you board rather than where you get-off (except for the cross-boundary route B2 and a few overnight buses) which means it is more expensive to board at an earlier stop on a route rather than the later ones. Hence, the price of bus rides crossing the harbour between Kowloon and the Island exceeds $9 prior to the crossing. The fare is displayed on a digital display above the farebox - one may pay cash (but no change is given), an Octopus Card, a contactless VISA or Mastercard (on some routes; including those embedded on Apple Pay and Google Pay), or a ticket purchased from a bus travel centre (only applicable to a few routes found at major transit hubs such as Star Ferry or Central Bus Terminus) must be used. There are plenty of bus routes that provide a fare discount for transferring with a particular set of routes; they are often confusing for visitors, however instructions are written on bus stop timetable leaflets. There are also some bus routes (especially the routes going to Stanley) which offer discount if a passenger gets off early and taps the Octopus card again prior to alighting.  \nThere are announcements in Cantonese, Mandarin and English except for most buses on New Lantau Bus. To catch your bus, go to the bus stop with the right number and when your bus approaches, raise your arm to hail the bus (like you would hail a taxi). Buses only stop when requested so press the red buzzer (by the exit doors and on the grab-rails) to signal to the driver that you want to alight. Always board at the front and alight from the centre door.\nThe MTR also maintains a fleet of feeder buses. MTR passengers can enjoy a free feeder service if the bus trip is paid for on an Octopus card along with a connecting railway journey (except for taking K12 on holidays).\n\n\n=== By public light buses/minibuses ===\n\nVan-sized public light buses or minibuses serve both feeder and trunk routes, carry a maximum of 19 passengers (seats only) and come in two varieties, red minibuses and green minibuses (the red buses are also called maxicabs); the colour refers to a wide stripe painted on top of the vehicle.\n\nMost minibus station signs only offer Chinese description, and may have nothing more than the route number on the sign. Location markers of minibus stations on online maps are also spotty. Translation apps like Google Translate (including its camera function) and asking other passengers about the route are useful ways to determine whether the route serves your destination.\nRiding a minibus may not be easy for travellers, as it is required to call out the name of the stop and/or ask the driver to stop in Cantonese (shouting please stop loudly in English usually suffices), but more light buses are equipped with bells to notify the driver. Some station names used by minibuses may be outdated.\nIf a minibus station requires diversion from a green minibus' usual route and nobody on the minibus asked to stop, drivers may ignore the stop and take short cuts. The foolproof way for travellers is to inform the driver of your destination and remind the driver again when the minibus is approaching your destination.\nMinibuses sometimes depart from terminus only if they're full, so consider include waiting time if you're boarding a minibus at its terminus.\nSome red minibuses still do not accept Octopus but will give you change, while green minibuses accept Octopus payment but cannot give you change if you pay in cash. Prices on red minibuses are often displayed only in Chinese numbers. The price displayed on a red minibus can vary according to the market price, so one might need to pay more at busy times and on special occasions (such as during a typhoon or demonstration), though it is rare.\nMinibus drivers generally drive fast, especially at night. Always use minibus seatbelts where available, as it's against the law not to use them. All have a large digital speedometer in the cabin to discourage speeding and accidents. Dial \u260f +852-2754-7668 to report dangerous driving practices by minibus drivers if you encounter them.\nSeatbelts are often ignored by minibus passengers, but the police occasionally have an annual or bi-annual crackdown where offenders may be fined. Faulty seatbelts may also be encountered even on newer minibuses: show it to the police officers, and they would likely to spare you from tickets.\nThe Hong Kong Island green minibus #1 down from the Peak to Central is particularly exhilarating. Red minibuses tend to have a more Chinese feel than green buses.\nThere are six independent route numbering systems, applying to: buses (i) on Hong Kong Island, (ii) in Kowloon and the New Territories, and (iii) on Lantau Island; green minibuses (iv) on Hong Kong Island, (v) in Kowloon, and (vi) in New Territories and several exceptional auxiliary bus routes. Red minibuses do not usually have a route number. This leads to duplication of routes in different regions. \nGenerally you need not mention which district the route belongs to when you are asking for directions (almost all people will assume you are asking for the route which runs in the district you are in), but you really need to mention whether the route is by bus or minibus when you ask, since in some cases both buses and minibuses can have the same route number in the same area which are different routes.\n\n\n=== By ferry ===\n\nA large fleet of ferries sail between the many islands of Hong Kong. The granddaddy of them all and an attraction in itself is the Star Ferry, whose most popular line travels between Tsim Sha Tsui and Central from early morning until late at night, and offers amazing views (especially when coming from Tsim Sha Tsui). The Star Ferry is an icon of Hong Kong heritage and has carried passengers for over 120 years. Taking its 11-minute ride across the harbour and catching some misty breeze is considered a \"must do\" when visiting Hong Kong. Navigation enthusiasts will also not want to miss the sight of the crew using a billhook to catch the thrown rope as it moors at the pier, a practice unchanged since the first ferry ran in 1888.\nUpper deck seats cost $2.50 on weekdays and $3.40 on weekends while the lower deck costs $2.00 on weekdays and $2.80 on weekends, both payable with Octopus, cash (no change given) or by onsite vending machine. The Star Ferry also operates between Tsim Sha Tsui and Wanchai but only offers upper-deck seating. A 4-day tourist ticket is also available for $25.\nFerries to Lamma, Lantau and other islands depart from a variety of ports, but the largest and most important terminal is at Central adjacent to the Star Ferry. Ferries are usually divided into fast ferries and slow ferries, with fast ferries charging around twice the price for half the journey time, although not all destinations offer both kinds of service. Example fares for trips from Central to Yung Shue Wan (Lamma) are $10/15 slow/fast, and to Mui Wo (Lantau) $10.50/$21. All fares increase by around 50% on Sundays and public holidays. There is soemthimes an extra charge for seating in an air-conditioned area.\n\nFerry services known as kai-to (\u8857\u6e21/\u8857\u8254) serve the city's most remote islands, in which some are also tourist attractions. These ferries are often operated by small motorised sampans. A list of these services can be found on the website of the Transport Department, and are listed on Apple Maps as proper ferries.\n\n\n=== By taxi ===\n\nTaxis are plentiful, and are relatively cheap compared to those in Western cities. Unfortunately, Hong Kong taxi drivers are known to be unprofessional, shamelessly rude and sometimes overcharges passengers. Reckless speeding should be expected in most rides.\nIn general, there are three types of taxi in Hong Kong, easily identified by their colours: red, green and blue, all of which serve the airport and Hong Kong Disneyland. Taxis that have different colours are from taxi fleets, which operate like ridesharing companies but will also carry passengers who flag them down on the street. When in doubt, just take a red taxi.\nRates for each type of taxi are published online. Taxi fleets can set their own rates (usually more expensive) when booked, but must follow these rates when flagged down. Rates as of July 2024:\n\nConsiderations when riding taxis:\n\nWearing of seat belts is obligatory; a taxi will not carry extra passengers.\nTipping is usually not required or expected, however the driver will sometimes round the fare up to the nearest dollar.\nDrivers are required to provide change for $100 notes, but not for higher denominations. If you only have a $500 or $1000 note and are going through a tunnel, let the driver know beforehand and he will change it when paying at the toll booth.\nSome taxis accept credit cards, Octopus cards or mobile payment to avoid hassles with small change; these are usually indicated by a sticker in the windscreen. Fleet taxis should accept these payment methods.\nThere are no extra late-night charges nor peak-hour surcharges. No charges are levied for airport travel or travel within the centre, but all toll charges for tunnels are added to the bill. The driver will normally pay on your behalf at the toll booth and you just need to reimburse him before alighting.\nBaggage carried in the boot will cost you $5 per piece even if you lift it yourself, except for wheelchairs.\nHarbour crossing passengers (Hong Kong Island to Kowloon or vice versa) are expected to pay the return tolls (e.g. if the tunnel toll is $5, then you will need to pay for $10 on top of your taxi charge). But you can use this to your advantage by picking a homebound taxi from a cross-harbour taxi rank in places like the Star Ferry pier or Hung Hom station. In cross-harbour taxi stands, only single toll charge will be applied to the taxi fare.\nTaxi drivers must display an official name card that includes the driver's photograph and the license plate number. Unless a taxi has an out of service sign displayed, they are legally required to take you to your destination. They must provide a receipt upon request.\nAll taxis are radio equipped and can be reserved and requested via an operator for $5, payable to the driver. You are unlikely to need to call a taxi, though, as they are plentiful.\nTake your hotel's business card to show the driver the address in Chinese, as drivers speak limited English or Mandarin. Get your hotel concierge to write the name or address of your destination in Chinese. When using a maps app on a phone, your destination may also have a Chinese name which you can show to the driver.\nLearning some Cantonese pronunciation for your location will help (especially as some names don't sound in Cantonese like they are written in English). \"Do\" (said like \"Doe\" \u2013 a deer, a female deer, with a middle tone) and \"Gai\" (said more like \"Kai\" with a rising tone) are the Cantonese words for Road and Street respectively. If you can pronounce your suburb and local road correctly, this will help considerably.\nMobile taxi apps like eTaxi and HKTaxi are becoming widespread in Hong Kong. You always get a fair price, all payments are done by card, there's no need to call anyone, and you can get a taxi at any time in less than 10 minutes.\nUber continues to operate in Hong Kong despite a multi-year legal battle with the government. Drivers without the appropriate permits run the risk of fines, but passengers don't. Uber also operates Uber Taxi, which is free from legal ambiguity.\nYou may file a complaint to the Transport Complaints Unit Complaint Hotline at \u260f +852-2889-9999 or via their online complaint form. When filing a complaint, do note the taxi driver's name and license plate for identification.\n\n\n=== By car ===\nMain article: Driving in Hong Kong\nTraffic in Hong Kong moves on the left (the steering wheel is on the right-hand side), opposite to mainland China. Hong Kong is densely populated, has heavy traffic, a complex road network, and rare and expensive parking spaces, making driving very unappealing for most visitors. Furthermore, it is well-connected by public transportation, so a car may not be necessary. However, there are parts of the New Territories, Lantau Island and southern Hong Kong Island that are poorly served by public transport. The main article has information on driving, renting a car, and crossing the border from mainland China with a car.\n\n\n=== By bicycle ===\nHong Kong is generally not a bicycle-friendly place because of its hilly landscapes, government policies, air pollution and a general lack of consideration by many motorists. Locals sometimes cycle on the pavements if they are not crowded, although most of time, pavements are too crowded even for pushing your bike. If you plan to use busy urban roads you should be fit enough to keep up with the traffic, which moves surprisingly quickly.\nA network of paved cycling trails sprawl across the New Territories making it relatively easy to bike for longer distances, with the longest one stretching 60km from Tuen Mun to Ma On Shan. Unlike cycling in urban areas, riding on these tracks is quite enjoyable for the scenic rural views along the way. Southern Lantau Island is also a good place to cycle, as motor vehicle traffic is heavily restricted and consequently light on the roads there. Visitors should comply with the Road User's Code. Visit this page for maps of major cycle tracks.\nThere are also several mountain bike trails in the country parks, although a permit is necessary to bring your bicycle into the parks. \nBike rental is available in several locations across the territory. Popular rental spots include Cheung Chau, Mui Wo (Lantau), Sha Tin, Tai Po Market, Tuen Mun and Ma On Shan. Rental fees are typically $40\u201360 a day for a standard entry-level mountain bike, or around $150 per day for a higher-spec mountain or road bike.\nBasic rules to follow:\n\nCyclists are prohibited from riding on expressways and in tunnels, which are well patrolled.\nIt is an offence to be drunk while cycling.\nBy law, you're required to have a front and rear light.\nElectronic bike conversion systems are not allowed. The police have a strict enforcement policy on this offence.\nThe maximum penalty for riding on pedestrian walkways is $500 or a three-month jail sentence. Usually offenders get a warning, but the police occasionally have an annual, or bi-annual crackdown.\nFor folding bike users, sometimes a bus driver will tell you that it's not allowed, but if you talk to them nicely they will usually let you board. A bicycle bag that makes your bike look like ordinary luggage can make your life a lot easier.\n\n\n==== Bicycles on public transport ====\nFolding bicycles are permitted on all public transport, provided that they are folded.\n\nMTR: Non-folding bicycles are permitted to travel on the MTR system. Travel in the first or last carriage and remove the front wheel.\nFerries: Bicycles are permitted on board slow ferries including the Star Ferry, but are not permitted on the Fast Ferries.\nTaxis: Most taxi drivers will carry bikes in the boot if the front wheel is removed. Some drivers will carry your bike for free, others will legitimately charge extra for 'excess baggage'.\n\n\n=== By escalator ===\nThe world's longest outdoor escalator system travels from Central through Soho to the residential developments of the Mid-levels. The escalator moves down in the morning rush hour but up the rest of the time, and using it is free \u2014 in fact, you can even get Octopus credits from machines along the way for being willing to use your feet! The escalator is covered, but still relatively exposed to the elements.\nThe escalator cuts through some of the oldest streets found anywhere in Hong Kong, so if you are happy to take a chance and just wander and explore the back streets you are likely to find something of interest that dates back to colonial times.\n\n\n== See ==\nHong Kong doesn't have street benches to sit down. Whilst \"sitting out areas\" are around, these are generally infrequent. Additionally, restaurants (especially cheap and quick ones) will prefer quick table turnover. All this adds up to spending a considerable amount of time on your feet in any given day. Make sure you have a pair of comfortable shoes, as even a good pair of shoes will still leave your feet sore after a full day on your feet.\n\n\n=== Itineraries ===\nHong Kong Culinary Tour \u2014 gives a short tour to discover the unique cuisine of Hong Kong\nHong Kong to Kunming overland \u2014 covers one route to or from Hong Kong\n\n\n=== Guided walks ===\nA list of guided tours is available on the website of the Hong Kong Tourism Board.\n\n\n=== Victoria Peak ===\nGet a stunning view of Hong Kong Island on Victoria Peak atop the giant, wok-shaped Peak Tower! Ever since the dawn of British colonisation, the Peak hosted the most exclusive neighbourhood for the territory's richest residents. Prior to World War II, non-white people weren't permitted to even set foot here (except for domestic servants of the resident white families). The Peak Tower has an observation platform and a shopping mall with shops, fine dining, and museums. Read more at Hong Kong/Central#Victoria Peak.\n\n\n=== Horse racing ===\nHorse racing was introduced by the British during the colonial period, and remains serious business in Hong Kong. There are live broadcasts over the radio and many people bet regularly. When people are listening to the races, expect no conversation or business to transpire for the 1-2 minute duration of the race.\nWith the exception of a summer break between mid-July and mid-September, horse races take place on Wednesdays and on weekends, at either Sha Tin Racecourse in the New Territories or Happy Valley Racecourse on Eastern Hong Kong Island. Both locations are easily accessible by MTR. Happy Valley is the more convenient, historic, and impressive location, though Sha Tin is larger and hosts more top-level international races. \nGet a local to explain the betting system to you. Read Racing Post by the South China Morning Post on race days for a guide to the race. A beer garden is at the finish line of Happy Valley. Bring your passport and get in at the tourist rate of just $1 (compared to $10 for locals).\nBetting can also be placed at any of the more than 100 branches of the Hong Kong Jockey Club. Expect long lines and big crowds.\n\n\n=== Traditional heritage ===\n\nThere are many traditional heritage locations throughout Hong Kong.\n\nIn Kowloon you will find the Kowloon Walled City Park at the location of the former Kowloon Walled City, which has the remnants of the city's south gate, and a small open-air museum. In New Territories you will find Ping Shan Heritage Trail passing by some of the most important ancient sights, the walled Hakka village of Tsang Tai Uk, Fu Shin Street Traditional Bazaar as well as temples including Man Mo Temple and the Temple of Ten Thousand Buddhas. And on Lantau you will find the Stilt houses in Tai O, Po Lin Monastery and the Tian Tan Buddha Statue.\n\nHong Kong has traditionally been known for Cantonese opera (\u7cb5\u5287), which as the name suggests, originates in Guangdong province. This art form employs colourful props and costumes, with stories usually set in ancient China, and is a display of singing, martial arts, acting and acrobatics.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nThere are a variety of museums in Hong Kong with different themes. Arguably the best museum is the Hong Kong Museum of History in Kowloon, which gives an excellent overview of Hong Kong's fascinating past. Only an abridged version of the museum's permanent exhibit is available while the museum is renovated.\nKowloon also has a number of other interesting museums including Dialogue in the Dark, which is an exhibition in complete darkness where you should use your non-visual senses with the help of a visually impaired guide, Hong Kong Museum of Art, which is a fascinating, strange and elusive place exhibiting Chinese ceramics, terracotta, rhinoceros horn and Chinese paintings as well as contemporary art produced by Hong Kong artists, Hong Kong Science Museum, primarily aimed at children, and Hong Kong Heritage Discovery Centre.\nCentral also has its share of museums including Dr Sun Yat-sen Museum, Hong Kong Maritime Museum, Hong Kong Museum of Medical Sciences, which shows how the healthcare system evolved from traditional Chinese medicine to modern Western medicine, and Hong Kong Visual Arts Centre. There is also a 3D museum from Korea called Trick Eye Museum Hong Kong.\nThe Hong Kong Palace Museum in West Kowloon is a branch of the Palace Museum in Beijing's Forbidden City, and largely dedicated to displaying artifacts from the Forbidden City's collection.\n\n\n=== Nature ===\n\nContrary to popular belief, Hong Kong is not all skyscrapers and it is worthwhile to go to the countryside (over 70% of Hong Kong), including the country parks and marine parks. Many are surprised to find that Hong Kong is actually home to some stunning landscapes and breathtaking scenery.\n\nLantau Island is twice as big as Hong Kong island and is well worth checking out if you want to get away from the bright lights and pollution of the city for a spell. Here you will find open countryside, traditional fishing villages, secluded beaches, monasteries and more. You can hike, camp, fish and mountain bike, among other activities.\nIn the waters just off Tung Chung on Lantau Island, live the Chinese White Dolphin These dolphins are naturally pink and live in the wild, but their status is threatened, with the population estimated to be between 100\u2013200.\nThe Sai Kung Peninsula in New Territories is also a worthwhile place to visit. Its mountainous terrain and spectacular coastal scenery make this a special place. There are both challenging and more relaxed routes.\nHong Kong Wetland Park in New Territories is a relaxing park set amidst an ecological mitigation area. One can stroll along a network of board walks or explore the large visitors centre/museum.\nNorth East New Territories is also famous for its natural environment. Yan Chau Tong Marine Park is in the North East New Territories. A few traditional abandoned villages are connected with hiking trails in the territory. North East New Territories is a famous hiking hot spot for the locals.\nShort hiking trails (2 hours) can be found on Hong Kong Island and the New Territories. You can even hike up to the Victoria Peak.\nSome outlying islands are worth visiting, e.g., Lamma Island, Cheung Chau, Ping Chau, Tap Mun, Tung Lung Island.\n\n\n=== Theme parks ===\n\nHong Kong Disneyland Resort on Lantau Island features a Disneyland park, three resort hotels and a lake recreation centre. It offers some great attractions and short queues most of the year.\n\nOcean Park is on the southern side of Hong Kong island, and is the park that grew up with many local Hong Kong people. With roller coasters and large aquariums altogether, it is still packed on weekends with families and tourists. The cablecar is an icon. For many, the chance to see Hong Kong's pandas would be a deciding factor.\nNgong Ping 360 on Lantau Island is a Buddhist-themed park that features Imperial Chinese architecture, interactive shows, demonstrations, restaurants and coffee shops. The highlight of this trip is the longest cable car ride in Hong Kong that affords stunning views. The ride also takes you to the largest outdoor seated Buddha.\n\n\n=== Seeing Hong Kong by public transport ===\nTravelling on a bus or a tram is ideal for looking at different sides of Hong Kong. Not only is it cheap, it allows you to see completely different lifestyles in different districts in a short time. See Touring Hong Kong by public transport for details.\n\n\n=== Avenue of Stars and A Symphony of Lights ===\nHong Kong's version of the Hollywood Walk of Fame and Grauman's Chinese Theatre combined into one, the Avenue of Stars celebrates icons of Hong Kong cinema from the 20th century. The seaside promenade in Kowloon offers fantastic views, day and night, of Victoria Harbour and the skyline. This is also a great place to see A Symphony of Lights, a light and laser show synchronised to music and staged every night at 8PM.\n\n\n== Do ==\n\n\n=== Pop culture ===\nHong Kong was one of the main centres of Chinese pop culture from the communist revolution in 1949 until the 2010s, having given rise to many famous singers and actors. Hong Kong action cinema is legendary among Chinese people around the world. The city also played a key role in popularizing the genre of Cantopop, and some Cantopop songs have achieved cult status across the Chinese-speaking world, even among people who do not speak Cantonese. Television dramas by local station TVB also enjoyed loyal following among ethnic Chinese around the world.\nSince the 2010s, most of Hong Kong's top singers and actors have relocated to mainland China where they can make a lot more money. Nevertheless, the city continues to produce notable films on a regular basis, and Cantopop has experienced a revival of sorts in the 2020s, led by a new generation of local talent.\n\n\n==== Music festivals ====\nClockenflap is Hong Kong's largest music festival, and includes popular artists, mainly from Europe and the US. It takes place in November on the Central Harbourfront Event Space.\n\n\n==== Indie events ====\nCantopop is by far the most popular genre in Hong Kong and receives an immense amount of support from the media. Independent musicians and are often harassed and evicted from their rehearsal rooms and concert venues by the government because they are forced to illegally rent warehouse spaces due to unaffordable rents. A few small venues are open for indie shows, such as Hidden Agenda and The Wanch.\n\n\n=== Comedy ===\nHong Kong is home to one of Asia's most vibrant stand-up comedy scenes, with the scene being anchored by Take Out Comedy Club, the first full-time comedy club in Asia, and Backstage Comedy. Some pubs also have open mic nights for aspiring stand-up comedy performers; see COMEDY.HK for the a complete listing of live comedy shows in Hong Kong. Both Cantonese and English shows are performed regularly, so you should not have much difficulty finding an English show as a tourist.\n\n\n=== Beaches ===\nYou are never far from the sea in Hong Kong and going to a good beach is only a bus-ride away. However, if you want a really good beach, then it is worth making the effort to travel, possibly on foot, and seek out the beaches of the New Territories. With more than 200 outlying islands, as well as an extensive coastline that is jam-packed with impressive bays and beaches, you will surely come across some good looking beaches to while the whole day away. Hong Kong's urban beaches are usually well maintained and have services such as showers and changing rooms. Where beaches are managed by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department, shark nets and life guards are present. Dogs and smoking are not permitted on these beaches.\nThe best beaches to use include:\nRepulse Bay is a large urban beach on the south side of Hong Kong island that features a colourful Chinese temple. Money has been spent on its facilities and will appeal to those who have young children.\nMiddle Bay is popular with gay people and is a 20-minute walk from the crowds at Repulse Bay. Middle Bay has lifeguards, showers, changing rooms, shark nets and a decent cafe serving drinks and snacks.\nShek O is a beach popular with many young locals. It is away from the bustle of the city but is well served by restaurants and has a good bus service from the north side of the island. The Thai restaurant close to the beach is worth a try.\nBig Wave Bay is smaller than other beaches on Hong Kong Island,  but has good services which include a number of small cafes close to the beach. Big Wave Bay has the sort of waves that appeal to surfers. From here it is possible to take the coastal footpath to Chai Wan where you can find the MTR and buses. The walk to Chai Wan is about one hour, or more if you are not used to the steep climb up the mountain.\nHung Shing Yeh Beach on Lamma Island is the most popular beach. This beach is Grade 1 and shows off powdery, fine sand and clear water. This beach has changing facilities, a barbecue area, and a refreshment kiosk. Take the ferryboat from Central Pier to Yung Shue Wan; expect to walk around 20 minutes from the ferry terminal to the beach (buses and taxis are not an option on Lamma).\n\n\n=== Swimming pools ===\nIn addition to pools in many hotels, there are several public swimming pools scattered across the territory. Entrance costs $19 on weekends/$17 on weekdays for adults and $9 on weekends/$8 on weekdays for children, usually only payable by Octopus Card or by coins. Swimming pools are child-friendly with shallow pools and fountains. All swimming pool complexes are well maintained and offer swimming lanes, hot showers, lockers ($5 coin deposit or your own lock required), both family and same-sex changing rooms (limited privacy), and most have swimming clubs for serious swimmers. Swimmers are expected to provide their own towels and toiletries. The Kowloon Park Swimming Pool Complex in Tsim Sha Tsui is centrally located and offers visitors a wide range of services and includes an indoor Olympic-sized pool.\nMost pools open at 6:30AM and close at 10PM. They generally close for lunch noon-1PM and then again from 5-6PM.\n\n\n=== Sailing ===\nYou can rent a Junk Boat for a sailing trip. A typical junk boat can accommodate more than 30 people and can be rented for the day to take you on a tour of your choice. Sai Kung is a popular spot for the trip to start and you can sail to nearby beaches for a more secluded time. A cheaper alternative is to hire a much smaller water taxi (\u6c34\u9053) to take you to where you want to go.\nThere are a few boats that operate \"sunset cruises\" on the harbour.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nThe sports landscape in Hong Kong generally reflects its legacy of British colonial rule. Hong Kong sends its own team to international sports competitions, separate from the Chinese team. Hong Kong also sends a team to China's National Games. It will host the fencing, track cycling, golf, rugby sevens, beach volleyball, triathlon, tenpin bowling, men's handball and men's U22 basketball events for the 2025 National Games, to be held on 9-21 November.\nThe most popular sport in Hong Kong is football (soccer), and while the local league and national team are not of a high standard, it has the highest participation rate among all team sports in Hong Kong. The main home stadium of the Hong Kong national team is the Hong Kong Stadium in Causeway Bay, but some home games may be played at the Mong Kok Stadium instead.\nRugby union is also popular, with the territory hosting the Hong Kong Sevens, the world's most prestigious rugby sevens tournament, every year at Hong Kong Stadium. Hong Kong also has a respectable rugby union national team, which is the second strongest in Asia after Japan.\nCricket is most popular among the South Asian and Eurasian (European and Asian mixed-race) communities, and membership in the Hong Kong Cricket Club or Kowloon Cricket Club is somewhat of a status symbol for Hongkongers. Due to Hong Kong's mild climate, cricket is generally played in the winter months (Sept-April). Hong Kong is a third-tier ICC team, occasionally entering qualifying rounds for major tournaments but not routinely facing the stronger nations. The Hong Kong national cricket team plays at Tin Kwong Road (formerly Mission Road) in Kowloon.\nThe Kau Sai Chau Public Golf Course, on the eponymous island, is Hong Kong's only public golf course.\n\n\n=== Hiking and camping ===\n\nHiking is the best kept secret in Hong Kong, it is a great way to appreciate Hong Kong's beautiful landscapes that include mountains, beaches and breathtaking cityscapes. The starting points for many hiking trails are accessible by bus, minibus or taxi.\nHiking in Hong Kong can be strenuous because of the steep trails, and during the summer months, mosquitos and the hot, humid, weather combine to make even the easiest trek a workout. Wear suitable clothes, and bring plenty of water and mosquito repellent. It is fairly unlikely that you will have a close encounter with venomous snakes, although they are present in most rural areas. Most local people choose the winter months to undertake the more demanding hiking trails. If you are not especially fit you might plan your route so that you take a bus or taxi to the highest point of the trail and then walk downhill.\nCampsites in Hong Kong are plentiful and free of charge. Most are in country parks and range from basic sites serviced with only with a pit toilet, to those that provide campers with modern toilet blocks and cold showers. Some sites have running water and sinks for washing dishes. A few campsites have places to buy drinking water and food. Whilst many are serenely remote, weekends and public holidays are predictably busy, especially in the more accessible places close to roads. Hongkongers who camp like to do so in large groups, talk loudly, and stay awake late into the night. If you are noise sensitive try to find a remote campsite or pack some good earplugs.\nThere are four major trails in Hong Kong, consisting of different sections with varying difficulty.\n\nLantau Trail on Lantau.\nHong Kong Trail on Hong Kong Island.\nMaclehose Trail through the New Territories.\nWilson Trail starting on Hong Kong Island and finishing in the New Territories.\nThere are also shorter country trails which are generally easier than the average major trails. For first-time hikers, family walks offers newbie-friendly terrain that can be finished within hours.\nHong Kong has some exceptional rural landscapes but visitor impact is an issue. Respect the countryside by taking your litter home with you. Avoid putting food in litter bins in remote areas as these are not emptied on a regular basis and your trash may be strewn around by hungry animals.\nHong Kong Outdoors is packed with information on hiking and camping, and other great things to do and places to go in the wilderness areas of Hong Kong.\n\n\n=== Gambling ===\nWhile the closest casinos are in Macau, other forms of gambling are legal and regulated in Hong Kong. The minimum age for gambling is 18, and Hong Kong Jockey Club branches will refuse service to those who are wearing student uniform.\n\nHorse racing is the most popular and is further detailed above.\nFootball betting is legal only at branches of the Hong Kong Jockey Club. Betting on other sports is prohibited.\nLottery is also legal only at branches of the Hong Kong Jockey Club. Marksix is a popular game costing $10 per bet. You pick 6 of 49 numbers, and the lottery result will be announced on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and weekends that don't have horse racing scheduled.\nMahjong (\u9ebb\u96c0 m\u00e0h-jeuk) also forms an integral part of Hong Kong gambling culture, although it is often informal and difficult for foreigners to get involved with. Mahjong has a strong influence on Hong Kong pop culture, with a history of songs, films and television series based on a mahjong theme. The game played in Hong Kong is the Cantonese version, which differs in rules and scoring from the Japanese version, Taiwanese version or the versions played in other parts of China. Mahjong parlours are plentiful, although hard to find. They also have many unwritten rules that visitors may find hard to understand.\n\n\n== Learn ==\n\n\n=== Universities ===\n\nHong Kong has 12 universities. The oldest, the University of Hong Kong (\u9999\u6e2f\u5927\u5b78, abbreviated HKU in English or \u6e2f\u5927 in Chinese), is considered to be one of Asia's top universities. Other highly rated universities in Hong Kong include the Chinese University of Hong Kong (\u9999\u6e2f\u4e2d\u6587\u5927\u5b78, abbreviated CUHK in English or \u4e2d\u5927 in Chinese) and Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (\u9999\u6e2f\u79d1\u6280\u5927\u5b78). Most universities have exchange agreements with foreign universities, offering a good opportunity to study in Hong Kong. Courses for exchange students are often conducted in English.\n\n\n=== Learning Cantonese ===\nSome universities and private institutions offer Cantonese lessons for foreigners. This is a good way for those living in Hong Kong for an extended period of time to learn the local language. Like Taiwan and Macau, but unlike mainland China, the script taught is traditional Chinese.\n\n\n== Work ==\nUnless you are already a citizen or permanent resident of Hong Kong then you will need an employment visa in order to work. This usually involves potential employers making an application to the Immigration Department on your behalf; crucially you should have skills or qualifications that are in short supply in the local job market. Illegal working is punishable by 3 years of imprisonment plus deportation. Hong Kong courts are very tough on sentencing illegal workers, and one should not expect leniency if caught.\nSpouses of employment visa holders can apply for a dependent visa which has no limitations for working within Hong Kong (except perhaps for government posts), although it will terminate at the same time as the visa of the main holder. Spouses who are citizens of the PRC may face issues in obtaining a dependent visa unless they have been living outside the PRC for more than a year.\nThe Quality Migrant Application Scheme targets highly skilled workers (preferably university educated) to come and settle in Hong Kong and seek employment. For more information, visit the website of the Hong Kong Immigration Department. Hong Kong has a small ESL market; teachers will typically need a bachelor's degree and a TESOL certification. ESL teachers in Hong Kong can expect to earn $12,000-25,000 (monthly) and will usually teach 30 to 40 hours a week. Contracts will sometimes include accommodation and airfare.\nYou are eligible to apply for permanent residency after living in Hong Kong on a temporary permit for 7 years or more continuously, which allows you to live and work in Hong Kong indefinitely with no restrictions. You must be physically residing in Hong Kong during this time without any long absences. Permanent residency can also be obtained by investing a lot of money in a local business. Check with the immigration department for more details.\nYoung people between 18 and 30 years old who are citizens of Australia, Austria, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and United Kingdom are eligible to apply for a working holiday visa (valid for 6 months for Austrian citizens, 12 months for others), allowing them to take up temporary work and a short period of study in Hong Kong. Visit the Immigration Department's website for more information.\nHong Kong's personal and corporate income tax rates are among the lowest in the world, making it a popular tax haven for many of the world's richest people, and a popular place for multinational corporations to set up their Asia-Pacific headquarters.\n\n\n== Buy ==\n\n\n=== Money ===\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar, denoted by the symbol \"$\" (\u6e2f\u5143 or \u6e2f\u5e63, ISO code HKD), is the territory's currency. In Cantonese, one dollar is known formally as the \u5713 (y\u00f9n) and colloquially as the \u868a (m\u0101n). It is subdivided into 100 cents (symbol \u00a2). In Cantonese, one cent known as a \u4ed9 (s\u012bn), and ten cents is known as a \u6beb (h\u00f2u). You can assume that the '$' sign used in this travel guide and in the territory refers to HKD. The HKD is also widely accepted in Macau in lieu of its own currency at a 1:1 rate.\nThe official exchange rate is fixed in a range of HK$7.75-7.85 to US$1, although bank rates may fluctuate slightly. When exchanging currency at a big bank, be prepared to pay a small fixed commission, usually about $40 per transaction. If exchanging large amounts, this commission will have a negligible impact on the transaction. If exchanging small amounts, it may be advantageous to exchange at one of many independent exchange stalls or pawnshops found in tourist areas. Although their exchange rates compared with big banks may be slightly less favourable, most do not charge a commission. They may also be more convenient and a faster way to exchange (no queues, in shopping centres, open 24 hours, minimal paperwork, etc.) However, be wary of using independent exchangers outside banking hours because, without competition from big banks, their rates may be very uncompetitive.\nIf you go to the right place, Hong Kong can be an excellent place to exchange money, including from one foreign currency to another (i.e. non-HK$ pairs), as some places offer very good exchange rates with low or no commissions, and without the various restrictions and paperwork you have to deal with to exchange money in mainland China. One competitive place to exchange money is Chungking Mansion in Tsim Sha Tsui, with a high density of Pakistani and Indian currency sellers. However, the money changers at the entrance generally have worse rates than those in the interior.\nTry to avoid changing money at the airport, train station, hotels, or at street blocks or buildings with only one exchange stall since the rates offered there are usually less favourable. Street money exchange vendors will often offer different rates and you may be able to save around 10% if you can compare several different places rather than using the first one you see. \nGetting money by withdrawing with Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) or debit cards may have competitive exchange rates and most big banks do not charge an ATM usage fee, though your banks may impose their own fees (including foreign exchange markups and fixed withdrawal fees). Some smaller banks do not accept ATM cards from overseas customers though. The best banks for foreign tourists to use are HSBC, Hang Seng and Standard Chartered, and ATMs from those banks are widespread and can be found at any MTR station and along every major street corner.\nOther than the $10 banknote, all others are issued by multiple banks in Hong Kong, namely the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC), Standard Chartered Bank and the Bank of China. Although they have slightly different designs, notes of the same denomination have the same colour and all of them can be used anywhere in Hong Kong. They come in denominations of $10, $20, $50, $100, $500 and $1000. Some shops do not accept $1000 notes due to counterfeiting concerns.\n\nCoins come in units of $10, $5, $2, $1, 50\u00a2, 20\u00a2 and 10\u00a2. Typically you will want to avoid change less than $1 because there are not many things to buy with coins under that, and some shops may refuse them outright. An Octopus Card is the best way to avoid dealing with small change.\nThe Octopus cards you use for transport (see #Get around section) can also be used to pay for items at many fast food chains, supermarkets, and convenience stores. Mobile payment like Alipay, WeChat Pay and PayMe (provided by HSBC) is gaining traction among merchants, but a large number of smaller shops still accepts cash only. For Alipay and WeChat Pay, some might also only accept their Hong Kong versions instead of Mainland Chinese versions.\nATMs are ubiquitous. They universally accept Visa, MasterCard, and now UnionPay, and to a lesser degree Maestro and Cirrus. No ATMs accept American Express. Credit card use is common in most shops for major purchases. Most retailers accept Visa, MasterCard, and American Express. Maestro debit cards are not widely accepted by retailers. \nSometimes, the merchant can give you a choice of whether to charge your credit card purchase directly to your home currency or Hong Kong dollars. You should always charge your card in Hong Kong dollars and let your bank perform the conversion.\nThe 'chip and pin' system for credit card authorisation is not used as extensively in Hong Kong as elsewhere. Many retailers use contactless communications for foreign-issued cards and if used for small purchases, a signature is not required. Apple Pay and Google Pay acceptance is near universal within the same venues that take contactless cards.\n\n\n=== Banking ===\nOpening a bank account in Hong Kong is a straightforward process, requiring a proof of address and a corresponding ID. A Hong Kong identification card (of any type) will make the process much easier, although foreign visitors are allowed to open bank accounts as well using their foreign address. Banks will almost always have English speaking staff available.\nSome banks can also provide accounts and UnionPay credit cards in the Chinese RMB currency, which can then be used when travelling in mainland China. In addition, Hong Kong bank accounts support PromptPay QR code payments in Thailand, which makes onward travel there easier as well.\n\n\n=== Costs ===\nHong Kong is expensive by Asian standards, with the cost of accommodation especially high. A comfortable mid-range hotel room will cost at least $800 a night, although those who are really on a shoe-string budget could find something for less than $200 for just a bed in a hostel.\nTransport is however relatively cheap, with most public transport journeys costing just a few dollars. Even taxis won't break the bank with short journeys costing about $30, although crossing the harbour will add another $80 to your tab.\nEating out in Hong Kong is generally cheaper than in Western countries, and prices start from about $30 per serve for a basic meal of porridge or noodles, although in mid-range restaurants, $200\u2013300 per head is common. At the other end of the spectrum, fine dining can also be very expensive, and prices on the order of $1000 per head or more are not unheard of.\nFinally it is worth noting that Hong Kong does not have a sales tax and therefore prices for moderately expensive items (such as imported shampoo, mobile phones etc.) will generally be less than in China, Europe and other countries with sales tax.\n\n\n=== Tipping ===\nAs a general rule, tipping is not customary in Hong Kong, though people will not reject any tips you care to hand them. Tipping is a matter of personal choice, but visitors should take into account that locals usually do not leave a tip. Visitors should also know that it is common for bar and restaurant owners to keep some, or all, of the money given as tips to waiters.\nIn cheaper restaurants, tipping is not expected at all and it will be considered unusual not to take all your change. In medium-to-upmarket restaurants, a 10% service charge is often compulsorily added to your bill (i.e. the prices of food and beverage items you see on the menu do not calculate and include service charge yet). You may, at your own discretion, choose to tip on top of that if the service was exemplary; to give it more chance of reaching the staff, tips should be given in cash and not as additions to a credit card bill. It is also common for mid range Chinese restaurants to give you peanuts, tea and towels and add a small charge to the bill.  Known as \"cha-sui money\" (money for tea and water), it is considered to be common practice, so unless the charge is excessive, tourists should accept it as part of the cost of the meal. Sometimes, restaurants will deliberately give customers change in coins, when notes could be given; it is your choice whether to take all your change or leave a small tip.\nTipping is not expected in taxis but passengers will often round up the fare to the nearest dollar. During a typhoon, when any loss is not covered by insurance, a tip will be expected, or the taxi driver will ask you to pay a surcharge. In hotels, a guest is also expected to tip at least $10\u201320 for room service, and porters also expect $10\u201320 for carrying your bags. Bathroom attendants in luxury restaurants and clubs might also expect you to leave a few coins, but it's socially acceptable not to tip.  \nDo not under any circumstances try to offer a tip to a government employee, especially police officers; this is regarded as bribery and is strictly illegal.\nExceptionally, on important occasions, such as a wedding party or similar big gala event, local people hosting such events do tip substantially more than ten percent of the total bill. The money is put into a red packet (called \u5229\u662f lai si in Cantonese) and given to the manager.\n\n\n=== Shop ===\nMain article: Shopping in Hong Kong\nFierce competition, no sales tax and many wealthy consumers all add up to make Hong Kong an excellent destination for shopping. Choices are plentiful at competitive prices. Lookout for watches, camping equipment, digital items and luxury cosmetics.\nPopular shopping items include consumer electronics, custom clothing, shoes, camping equipment, jewellery, expensive brand name goods, Chinese antiques, toys and Chinese herbs/medicine. There's also a wide choice of Japanese, Korean, American and European clothing and cosmetics but prices are generally higher than in their respective home countries.\n\n\n== Eat ==\nIndividual listings can be found in Hong Kong's district articles\n\nSee also: Hong Kong Culinary Tour, Chinese cuisine, Western food in Asia\nCuisine plays an important part in many peoples' lives in Hong Kong. Not only is it a showcase of various regional Chinese cuisines, but there are also excellent Asian and Western options, and creative fusion between the various cuisines. Although Western food is often adapted to local tastes, Hong Kong is a good place for homesick travellers who have had enough of Chinese food.\nDue to its history as part of that region, unsurprisingly, much of the local cuisine in Hong Kong is very similar to that of neighbouring Guangdong. That being said, over a century of British rule means that the British have also left their mark on the local cuisine, with cakes and pastries being fairly popular among locals. Hong Kongers are also somewhat less adventurous than their fellow Cantonese speakers in mainland China, with several exotic ingredients such as dog and cat meat being banned in Hong Kong. Indian immigrants brought over by the British have also left their mark on Hong Kong cuisine, and curry (\u5496\u55b1) is a popular condiment. While authentic Indian curries can certainly be found, Hong Kong curries are generally adapted for the Cantonese palate, with the spice level dialed down drastically. \nIt is also possible to find cuisine from practically every part of China, as many famous chefs fled from the mainland to Hong Kong to escape persecution by the communists in the aftermath of the Chinese Civil War. In particular, the Hakkas and Teochews have left a significant impact on Hong Kong's culinary culture, and there is no shortage of good Hakka and Teochew restaurants for those who have grown weary of Cantonese food.\nYou may meet some local people who haven't cooked at home for a decade. Locals love to go out to eat since it is much more practical than socializing in crowded spaces at home. A long queue can be a local sport outside many good restaurants during peak hours. Normally, you need to register first, get a ticket and wait for empty seats. Reservations are usually only an option in upmarket restaurants.\n\n\n=== Eating etiquette ===\nChinese food is generally eaten with chopsticks. However, restaurants serving Western food usually provide a knife, fork and spoon. Do not stick your chopsticks vertically into a bowl of rice, as this is reminiscent of incense sticks burning at the temple and has connotations of wishing death on those around you. In addition, chopsticks should not be used to move bowls and plates or make any noise. Dishes in smaller eateries might not come with a serving spoon, although staff will usually provide one if you request.\nA few Hong Kong customs to be aware of:\n\nTo thank the person who pours your tea Cantonese style, tap two or three fingers on the table three times. The legend suggests a story involving a Chinese emperor travelling incognito and his loyal subjects wanting to kowtow (bow) to him without blowing their cover \u2014 hence the \"finger kowtow\".\nIf you want more tea in the pot, leave the lid open, and it will be refilled.\nIt is not unusual for customers to rinse their plates and utensils with hot tea before starting their meal, and a bowl is often provided for this very purpose. This is due to the fact that cheaper restaurants may often have washing residues on dishes or utensils.\nExcept for very expensive places, there is no real dress code in Hong Kong. You will often see people in suits and others in t-shirts in the same restaurant.\nSee also Chinese table manners for more details. While there are some minor differences, much of traditional Chinese dining etiquette applies to Hong Kong too.\n\n\n=== Local foods, eating establishments, and costs ===\n\nYou can usually tell how cheap (or expensive) the food is from the decor of the restaurant. Menus are not always displayed outside restaurants and English menus are not available at budget restaurants. Restaurants in Soho in Central, in 5-star restaurants, or in other high-rent areas are usually more expensive than restaurants that are off the beaten path. It is easy to find places selling mains for well under $80, offering both local and international food. Local fast food chains such as Caf\u00e9 de Coral (\u5927\u5bb6\u6a02) and Fairwood (\u5927\u5feb\u6d3b) offer meals for $30\u201350, with standardised English menus for easy ordering. Mid-range restaurants generally charge in excess of $100 for mains. At the top end, fine dining restaurants, such as Felix or Aqua, can easily see you leave with a bill in excess of $1500 (including entr\u00e9es (appetisers), mains, desserts and drinks). If your budget allows for it, Hong Kong is undoubtedly one of, if not the world's best places to experience Chinese-style fine dining.\nTap water is typically not served and you will need to buy bottled water from most restaurants instead.\n\n\n==== Dim sum ====\nDim sum (\u9ede\u5fc3), literally means 'to touch (your) heart', is possibly the best known Cantonese dish. Served at breakfast and lunch, these delicately prepared morsels of Cantonese cuisine are often served with Chinese tea.\nDim Sum comes in countless variations with a huge price range from $8 to more than $100 per order. Common items include steamed shrimp dumplings (\u8766\u9903 har gau), pork dumplings (\u71d2\u8ce3 siu mai) and barbecued pork buns (\u53c9\u71d2\u5305 char siu bau), the first two being obligatory for local diners whenever they eat dim sum. Expect more choice in upmarket restaurants. One pot of tea with two dishes, called yak chung liang gin is a typical serving for breakfast.\n\n\n==== Siu Mei ====\nSiu mei (\u71d2\u5473) is a general name for roast meats made in a Hong Kong style, including roasted crispy pork belly (\u71d2\u8089 siu yuk), barbecued pork (\u53c9\u71d2 char siu), roast duck (\u71d2\u9d28 siu aap) or soy sauce chicken (\u8c49\u6cb9\u96de si yau gai). With the addition of a slightly crispy honey sauce layer, the final taste is of char siu a unique, deep barbecue flavour. Rice with roasted pork, roasted duck, pork with a crisp crackling, or Fragrant Queen's chicken (\u9999\u5983\u96de), are common dishes that are enduring favourites for many, including local superstars. It is recommended to taste the roasted pork with rice in 'Sun-Can' of PolyU.\n\n\n==== Congee ====\nCantonese congee (\u7ca5 juk) is a thin porridge made with rice boiled in water. Served at breakfast, lunch or supper, the best version is as soft as 'floss', it takes up to 10 hours to cook the porridge to reach this quality. Congee is usually eaten with savoury deep-fried Chinese doughnuts (\u6cb9\u70b8\u9b3c yau char kway) and steamed rice pastry (\u8178\u7c89 cheong fun) which often has a meat or vegetable filling.\nHong Kong has several restaurant chains that specialise in congee, but none of them have earned the word-of-mouth respect from local gourmets. The best congee places are usually in older districts, often owned by elderly people who are patient enough to spend hours making the best floss congee.\n\n\n==== Noodles ====\nWhen asked what food makes Hong Kong people feel at home, wonton noodles (\u96f2\u541e\u9eb5) are a popular answer. Wonton are dumplings usually made from minced prawn but may contain small amounts of pork.\nRice pastry is also a popular dish from southern China. Found particularly in Teochew and Hokkien areas in China, its popularity is widespread throughout east Asia. In Hong Kong, it is usually served in soup with beef and fish balls and sometimes with deep-fried crispy fish skins.\n\n\n==== Two-dish rice ====\nThe classic working-class meal in Hong Kong, this consists of white rice with numerous other traditional Cantonese dishes to choose from, with customers typically picking two to three dishes, hence the name \"two-dish rice\" (\u5169\u9938\u98ef l\u00e9uhng sung faahn). As the dishes are rarely labelled, customers typically choose their dishes by pointing and saying \u5462\u500b (n\u0113i go, meaning \"this one\"), giving it its nickname \"this this rice\". Once looked down upon and considered to be \"poor man's food\", its popularity skyrocketed during the COVID-19 pandemic, when dine-in establishments were forced to close, and many two-dish rice stalls are now famous among locals for specific dishes. Do not expect much English proficiency at such establishments, but if you can find a way to communicate, these are excellent places to have an affordable meal, with prices hovering around $40 (about US$5).\n\n\n==== Tong Sui ====\nA popular Cantonese dessert is a sweet soup called tong sui (\u7cd6\u6c34, literally sugar water). Popular versions are usually made with black sesame paste (\u829d\u9ebb\u7cca), walnuts (\u6838\u6843\u7cca) or sago (\u897f\u7c73\u9732) which are usually sticky in texture. Other traditional ones include red bean paste (\u7d05\u8c46\u6c99), green bean paste (\u7da0\u8c46\u6c99) and tofu pudding (\u8c46\u8150\u82b1). Lo ye (\u6488\u91ce) is a similar dish. Juice is put into an ultra-cold pan to make an ice paste, it is usually served with fresh fruit and sago.\n\n\n==== Tea cafes & tea time ====\n\nA uniquely Hong Kong-style eatery that has made waves elsewhere in Asia is the cha chaan teng (\u8336\u9910\u5ef3), literally \"tea cafe\", but offering fusion fast food that happily mixes Western and Eastern fare: innovations include macaroni soup with ham, instant noodles with spam and egg, Hong Kong-style French toast, and baked rice or spaghetti with meat sauce and cheese. Usually a wide selection of drinks is also available, almost always including the popular tea-and-coffee mix yuen yeung (\u9d1b\u9d26), and perhaps more oddities (to the Western palate) like boiled Coke with ginger or iced coffee with lemon. Orders are usually recorded on a chit at your table and you pay at the cashier as you leave.\nShowing signs of British colonial influence, tea time (\u4e0b\u5348\u8336 hah \u0144gh ch\u00e0h) plays an important role in Hong Kong's stressful office life. Usually starting at 2PM to 3PM, a typical tea set goes with a cup of 'silk-stocking' tea, egg tarts and sandwiches with either minced beef, egg or ham, but without vegetables and cheese.\nHong Kong's version of milk tea shares a similar taste with Malaysia's teh tarik. A distinctive feature of Hong Kong-style milk tea is the sackcloth bag that is used to filter the tea leaves, which looks like silk stockings after being dyed with tea, giving the name 'silk-stocking milk tea'. Milk tea, to some Hong Kong people, is an important indicator on the quality of a restaurant. If a restaurant fails to serve reasonably good milk tea, locals might be very harsh with their criticism. Yuanyang is also a popular drink mixed with milk tea and coffee.\nA signal to tell you teatime has come is a small queue lining up in a bakery to buy egg tarts (\u86cb\u64bb, a teatime snack with outer pastry crust and filled with egg custard). Don't attempt to make a fool of yourself by telling people that the egg tart was brought to Hong Kong by the British - many locals are assertive in claiming sovereignty over their egg tarts. When a long-established egg tart shop in Central was closed due to skyrocketing rental payments, it became the SAR's main news and many people came to help the owners look for a new place. Hong Kong egg tarts differ from the Macau version mainly in their crust; the Hong Kong version typically uses a crumbly crust like English custard tarts, while the Macau version typically uses a flaky crust like the Portuguese pastel de nata.\nFor those who wish to have an authentic British high tea experience, the colonial Peninsula Hotel is one of the best places in Asia to do so.\nTo stuff your stomach in a grassroots Chaa Chan Teng (\u8336\u9910\u5ef3) (local tea restaurant), expect to pay $15\u201328 for milk, tea or coffee, $15\u201318 for a toast, and $39\u201360 for a dish of rice with meats. Wonton noodles generally cost $35\u201345.\n\n\n==== Street food ====\nThe cheapest food is in the popular street stalls. Most of the people working there do not speak much English and there is often no English on the menu. However, if you could manage to communicate, street-style eating is an excellent way to experience local food. Point, use fingers (or Cantonese numbers) and smile. They're usually willing to help. Local specialities include curry fish balls (\u5496\u55b1\u9b5a\u86cb), fake shark fin soup (\u7897\u4ed4\u7fc5) made with beans and vermicelli noodles, egg waffle (\u96de\u86cb\u4ed4), fried three filled treasures (\u714e\u91c0\u4e09\u5bf6, vegetable filled with fish meat), stinky tofu (\u81ed\u8c46\u8150), fried intestines on a stick, fried squid or octopus and various meats on sticks (such as satay style chicken).\n\n\n==== Fast food ====\nMost major fast food eateries are popular in Hong Kong and have reasonable prices. McDonald's sells a Happy Meal set for $20\u201325.\n\n\n==== Seafood ====\n\nSeafood (\u6d77\u9bae hoi sin) is very popular and is widely available. The best places to eat seafood include Sai Kung, Sam Shing, Po Doi O and Lau Fau Shan in the New Territories and Hong Kong's islands, particularly Lamma and Cheung Chau, are abound with seafood restaurants. Seafood is not cheap. Prices range from $200 per head for a very basic dinner, to $300\u2013500 for better choices and much more for the best on offer.\nExpect to find a mismatch between the high prices for the food and the quality of the restaurant. Sometimes the best food is served in the most basic eateries where tables maybe covered in cheap plastic covers rather than a more formal tablecloth. Often, Cantonese people value the food more than the decor. If one of your travelling companions does not like seafood, don't panic, many seafood restaurants have extensive menus that cater for all tastes. A number of seafood restaurants specialise in high quality roast chicken that is especially flavoursome. Many exotic delicacies like abalone, conch and bamboo clam can be found for sale in many seafood restaurants but you might want to avoid endangered species such as shark and juvenile fish.\n\n\n==== Exotic meats ====\nWhile Hong Kong has long banned dog and cat meat and has strict rules on importing many meats of wild animals, snake meat is commonly seen in winter in different restaurants that bear the name \"Snake King\". Served in a sticky soup, it is believed to warm your body.\nThere's an ongoing debate over the consumption of shark fin in Hong Kong, which is the biggest importer of this exotic cuisine. Commonly served at wedding parties and other important dining events, shark fin is served in a carefully prepared stew at as much as $1000/bowl. The consumption of shark fin is controversial due to the inhumane manner in which the fins are collected. Sharks are removed from the ocean, their fins are cut off, and they are discarded back into the ocean still alive to die a slow unpleasant death. To quell your curiosity, imitation shark fin soup is available, and reportedly indistinguishable from the real thing.\nBesides exotic meats, you will also see chicken feet, pig's noses and ears, lungs, stomachs, duck's heads, various types of intestines, livers, kidneys, black pudding (blood jelly) and duck's tongues on the Chinese dining tables.\n\n\n==== International cuisine ====\nDue to the large number of foreign residents in Hong Kong, there are many restaurants that serve authentic international cuisine at all price levels. This includes various types of Japanese, Thai, Indian, Malaysian, American and European foods. These can often be found in, though not restricted to, entertainment districts such as Lan Kwai Fong, Soho or Knutsford Terrace. Of these, Soho is probably the best for eating as Lan Kwai Fong is primarily saturated with bars and clubs. Chungking Mansions in Tsim Sha Tsui is known to locals for having a high concentration of affordable Indian and African restaurants. Top chefs are often invited or try to make their way to work in Hong Kong.\n\n\n==== Local Western food ====\nWhile authentic Western food is certainly available at higher-end restaurants, much of the Western food in Hong Kong has been localised to the point of being hardly recognisable to Westerners, resulting in a unique style known as \"soy sauce Western\" (\u8c49\u6cb9\u897f\u9910). This style of Western food is mainly sold at cha chaan teng, though a local mid-range restaurant chain famous for this style of cuisine is Tai Ping Koon (\u592a\u5e73\u9928), best known to locals for a dish called \"Swiss chicken wings\" (\u745e\u58eb\u96de\u7ffc).\n\n\n==== Home-dining ====\nHome-dining is catching on to be a very popular trend in Hong Kong. BonAppetour is a great way to discover local chefs who would love to have you over for an evening dinner. It's a great way to make friends over home-made food, and company.\n\n\n==== Barbecue ====\nBarbecue (BBQ) meals are a popular local pastime. Many areas feature free public barbecue pits where everybody roasts their own food, usually with long barbeque forks. It's not just sausages and burgers - the locals enjoy cooking a variety of things at BBQ parties, such as fish, beef meatballs, pork meatballs, chicken wings, and so on. A good spot is the Southern Hong Kong Island, where almost every beach is equipped with many free BBQ spots. Just stop by a supermarket and buy food, drinks and BBQ equipment. The best spots are Shek O (under the trees at the left hand side of the beach) and Big Wave Bay.\nKau Wah Keng (\u4e5d\u83ef\u5f91) village in Lai King, New Territories was home to some private-run BBQ sites that provide food upon payment. These BBQ sites are unlicensed, and authorities had clamped down on their operation during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n==== Wet markets ====\nWet markets are still prevalent. Freshness is a key ingredient to all Chinese food, so frozen meat and vegetables are frowned upon, and most markets display freshly butchered beef and pork (with entrails), live fish, and more exotic shellfish, frogs, turtles and sea snails. Local people often go to the market everyday to buy fresh ingredients, just like the restaurants.\n\n\n==== Cooked food centres ====\nCooked food centres are often found in the same building as some of the indoor wet markets. Tables that used to be on the street have been swept into sterile concrete buildings. Inside, the atmosphere is like a food court without the frills. Cooked food centres provide economic solutions to diners, but you might need to take along a Cantonese speaker, or be brave.\n\n\n=== Dietary restrictions ===\nAs many people in Hong Kong's South Asian community are Hindu or Muslim, your best bet for religious diets that fall into those categories are restaurants that serve those communities. The Islamic Trust is Hong Kong's halal certification body, and Muslims visitors can contact them for more information about halal food in Hong Kong. Due to the small size of Hong Kong's Jewish community, kosher food is rare; contact the Ohel Leah Synagogue for more information.\nVegetarians should look for specialist vegetarian restaurants that primarily serve devout Buddhists (look for the characters \u7d20 or \u9f4b, or the \u534d symbol, in this context a Buddhist symbol). Some Buddhist temples may also sell vegetarian food during the weekends or various Buddhist festivals. As Chinese Buddhist vegetarian food does not usually make use of eggs or dairy products, it is almost always suitable for vegans. Remembering the Cantonese phrase \u6211\u98df\u9f4b (ng\u00f3h sihk j\u0101ai), telling that you are vegetarian, also goes a long way in getting your point across.\nPeople with allergies will have difficulty in Hong Kong, as awareness of common allergies is poor. Gluten-free diets in particular are very hard to come by as coeliac disease is very rare in Hong Kong, and much of Hong Kong's local cuisine makes heavy use of soy sauce. Dairy is somewhat more common in Hong Kong than in mainland China due to the stronger British influence, but nevertheless does not feature very prominently in traditional Cantonese cuisine, so lactose-intolerant people should not have any major issues finding something suitable for them. On the bright side, avoiding nuts is fairly easy, as they are uncommon in Hong Kong cuisine.\n\n\n== Drink ==\n\n\n=== Tea ===\nMain article: Tea\nAs with the rest of China, tea is a popular beverage in Hong Kong, and is served at practically every eatery. Chinese teas are the most commonly drunk in Hong Kong, but there is also a distinct Hong Kong-style milk tea that is served in chaa chaan teng, and traditional English milk tea can be found in higher-end Western restaurants. In summer 'Ice Lemon Tea' is a common option that is rather bitter and needs some syrup to counter this.\n\n\n=== Alcohol ===\n\nHong Kong does not have a culture of heavy drinking, and there are many neighbourhoods without much in the way of a bar or pub. Drinking alcohol with food is acceptable, but there is no expectation to order alcohol with your meal in any restaurant. A number of popular restaurants do not sell alcohol because of a licence restriction.\nLan Kwai Fong (Central), Wan Chai, and Knutsford Terrace (Tsim Sha Tsui) are the three main drinking areas where locals, expats, and tourists come together. Lan Kwai Fong is known for its lively, block party atmosphere, attracting many expats and tourists. The rooftop bar Faye on the 25th floor of the California Tower at Lan Kwai Fong is a hotspot for European exchange students. Some clubs in Lan Kwai Fong enforce dress codes, and tourists are expected to comply. As a rule, avoid wearing shorts or pants that are above knee length. For those on a budget, the 7-Eleven in Lan Kwai Fong is a popular spot to grab a drink and join the party scene.\nJust a short walk away, Peel Street and the surrounding SoHo area have emerged as the preferred hangout for long-term expats, offering more relaxed bars, better cocktails, and a more laid-back atmosphere than the tourist-heavy clubs of LKF.\nWan Chai is known less for its drinks than for its dated seediness. Once the centre of nightlife for US servicemen, today it is still popular with a certain crowd of older expats and bar girls, but it has a sleazy reputation and is generally avoided by younger locals and newer expats looking for a more contemporary vibe. Girlie bars or hostess bars are bars in which attractive bar girls drink and flirt with male patrons in exchange for tips. Cover charges and drink prices at these establishments are usually exorbitant, and you will be pressured to buy drinks for the bar girls. Generally speaking, the bar girls will not leave the bar with you; they are professional flirts, not prostitutes.\nGay bars and clubs are concentrated in Central, Sheung Wan, Causeway Bay and Tsim Sha Tsui (TST). The quality of these venues varies considerably and may disappoint those expecting something on the level of London, Paris or New York.\nThe minimum age for drinking alcohol is 18 years. There is usually a requirement for young adults to prove their age, especially when going to a nightclub. The accepted ID in clubs is either your passport or a Hong Kong ID card. Photocopies are rarely accepted due to minors using fake documents.\nDrinking out in Hong Kong can be expensive. Beer usually starts from $50 for a pint and more in a bar popular among expats. However, away from the tourist trail, some Chinese restaurants may have a beer promotion aimed at meeting the needs of groups of diners. In cooked food centres, usually found at the wet markets, young women are often employed to promote a particular brand of beer. Convenience stores and supermarkets sell a reasonable range of drinks.\nDuring Wednesdays and Thursdays, Ladies night applies in some bars in Wan Chai and Lan Kwai Fong, which in most cases means that women can enter bars and clubs for free, and in some rare cases also get their drinks paid for the night. On weekends, several bars and clubs in these areas also have an open bar for some of the night, which means you can drink as much as you like.\nSan Miguel (Cantonese name: Seng Lik), Tsing Tao (Ching Dou), Carlsberg (Ga Si Bak), Blue Girl (Lam Mui), Heineken (Hei Lik) and Sol are popular in the town. There is no longer any tax on wine or beer in Hong Kong.\n\n\n== Sleep ==\nIndividual listings can be found in Hong Kong's district articles\nWith more than 50,000 rooms available, Hong Kong offers a huge choice of accommodation from shockingly cheap digs to super luxury. However, budget travellers who are spoiled by cheap prices elsewhere in Asia are often shocked that the accommodation cost in Hong Kong is closer to that of London and New York.\nA 3% hotel accommodation tax is levied on hotel rooms, excluding service charges. You will pay the tax when you pay for hotel rooms.\nFor long-term accommodation, be prepared to splurge as real estate prices in Hong Kong are among the highest in the world, and many locals are forced to live in cramped \"shoebox\" apartments due to the astronomical rents in the city. \n\n\n=== Budget ===\nWhile it is possible to get a dorm bed for $120\u2013150, a single room for $270\u2013400, and a double room for $400\u2013500, you should not expect anything in these rooms except a bed, with barely enough space in the room to open the door. Accommodation with reasonable space, decoration, and cleanness is usually priced from $150\u2013200 for a dorm bed, $450\u2013600 for a single room, $700 for a double room, and $800 for a triple room.\nMost cheap guesthouses are found along Nathan Road between Tsim Sha Tsui and Mong Kok. Expect a tiny, undecorated room with just enough room for a bed. Bathrooms are often shared and noise could be a problem for light sleepers (not all customers are interested in sleeping). Be sure to read the online reviews before booking as bed bugs, dirty beds, and unclean bathrooms have been reported. Keep your expectations as realistically low as possible.\nPopular guesthouse clusters are inside the 17-floor 1 Chungking Mansions  (Nathan Road 36-44) (\u91cd\u6176\u5927\u5ec8 in Chinese, nicknamed Chungking Jungles by some local people), Mirador Mansions (\u7f8e\u9e97\u90fd\u5927\u5ec8) in Tsim Sha Tsui, and New Lucky House (\u83ef\u8c50\u5927\u5ec8) (15 Jordan Road). These towers are all in the city center and close to the buses to/from the airport. While these towers are regarded as slums by the locals, if you ignore the fake watch sellers and disturbing pimps, they are well-patrolled and safe.\nAnother cluster of hostels and guesthouses can be found on Paterson Street near Causeway Bay. While not as central as the mansions, the internet connections are more reliable and the rooms are generally clean. However, they are still small and cramped. Do not expect a great atmosphere or spacious rooms.\nNotice that some drab \"guesthouses\", especially those in Kowloon Tong, Mong Kok, and Causeway Bay, may actually be love hotels.\nThe Hong Kong Youth Hostel Association operates 7 youth hostels. All of them are outside of the city and cost $100\u2013$300 to reach via taxi when public transport service is not operating. All but the one on Hong Kong Island also have strict curfew rules and require guests to leave the site from 10AM to 4PM (1PM-3PM on public holidays). Free shuttle bus service is provided by several hostels but the service stops at 10:30PM.\nThe government advises travellers to stay in hostels with licences, this website may help you a lot: The Office of Licensing Authority maintains an online list of licensed accommodation establishments.\nThere are\n41 camping sites in Hong Kong. The facilities are on a \"first-come-first-served\" basis and places are booked quickly during weekends and public holidays. You are not allowed to camp other than in a designated camp site (identified by the sign board erected by the Country and Marine Parks Authority) and this rule is strictly enforced.\n\n\n=== Mid-range ===\nIf the mansions and hostels are too cramped for you, Hong Kong is a good place to spend a bit extra and get a proper hotel room. Many rooms in basic business hotels in the city center can be had for $700 per night. Rooms at mid-ranged hotels in Hong Kong tend to clean but cramped.\n\n\n=== Splurge ===\nFor affluent travellers, Hong Kong houses some of the best world class hotels that run a fierce competition for your wallets by offering pick-up service by helicopter, a Michelin star restaurant, and extravagant spas. Major international chains, including four- and five-star hotels, are also well-represented. Prices start from around $1,500, depending on the season.\n\n\n== Stay safe ==\nHong Kong is one of the safest cities in the world, with a large high-density population with diverse socio-economic backgrounds managed very effectively. The city experienced significant large-scale protests against new legislation with increasingly violent clashes with police between 2014 and 2019. The arbitrariness and broad applicability of the National Security Law imposed by China in 2020 has ended most public protest.\n\n\n=== Crime and other emergency services ===\nEven female travellers usually do not encounter any problems roaming the streets alone at night. Violent crime is extremely rare, though petty crime occurs from time to time. Pickpockets operate in crowded areas; be particularly careful on public transport during peak hours.\n\nThe Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF) is Hong Kong's law enforcement agency. Most officers wear light blue uniforms, though higher-ranking officers wear white uniforms. All police officers are required to carry their warrant cards while on duty, and must present it to members of the public on request. English proficiency among lower ranking police officers can be limited, though they will always have English-speaking interpreters on call to assist you. Police corruption is exceedingly rare. Bribery is a crime that is punishable by imprisonment.\nHong Kong films have often portrayed triads (Chinese organised crime syndicates) as gun-wielding gangsters who fear nobody, but that only happens in the movies. Gang violence does occur, but is generally limited to rival triads. Stay away from the triads by avoiding loan sharks and illegal betting, and they will not bother you.\nCall 999 when you urgently need help from the police, fire and ambulance services. 999 operators can speak English, and in case if you don't know your current location, you can be located by finding your nearest lamppost and replying the lamppost's number. The police should show up within 10 minutes in most cases. If you are deaf or have speech impairment, you can report your emergencies by SMS to 992 with your registered phone, which requires registration at a police station beforehand.\nThe 999 system, local police stations and reporting centres may be inaccessible during protests and incidents. Dial the following emergency numbers in case when the 999 system is down:\n\nFire Services Department: \u260f +852-2723-2233 for fire or medical emergencies\nHong Kong St. John Ambulance:\u260f +852-1878-000 with only 3 stations throughout Hong Kong, it may take a longer time for arrival.\nFor non-emergency police assistance, call \u260f +852-2527-7177. There is also a hotline that serves Japanese travellers at \u260f +852-2529-0000. If you received suspected scam calls, you can call \u260f 18222 (domestic) to receive advice.\n\n\n=== National security legislation ===\n\nPromoting the independence of any region within China's territorial claim, including Hong Kong or advocating any sanctions against China or Hong Kong is illegal, punishable with a lengthy prison sentence up to life. Forbidden themes include documentaries about the 2019\u20132020 protests, artwork criticising China, and photos depicting the police force in a negative light. Any speech that \"incites hatred or subversion\" against the Hong Kong or Chinese governments is also illegal; this has been interpreted broadly by the police, to include any criticism against the government that the authorities may find objectionable. \nPersonal attacks against police officers are also deemed seditious by the courts. Avoid displaying symbols that have been adopted by the independence movement, even if they were not designed for the purpose; these include the old colonial flag, and the British and American flags and national anthems.\nDefendants under the National Security Law can be sent to mainland China for trial, and there are concerns about arbitrary enforcement of the law. The American, British, Australian and Canadian governments have issued warnings.\nMajor political rallies used to take place every year on 4 June commemorating the bloodshed at Tiananmen Square in 1989. July 1 is a public holiday that commemorates the handover to China, but this day became a symbolic day of protest every year. Venues for protests (such as Victoria Park) are cordoned off by the police, and police will arrest anyone at the slightest suspicion that they are making political advocacy during such days.\n\n\n=== Legal matters ===\nDisrespecting the Chinese flag, emblem and anthem, along with the Hong Kong regional flag and emblem are punishable by 3 years of imprisonment.\nEveryone over the age of 16 is required to carry identification, which for foreigners means a passport, but a foreign identity card or photocopy of your passport will likely do; most visitors choose to keep their passport in a safe place. White people are rarely targeted by the police for ID checks. South Asians and Africans are more likely to be targeted.\nIf you get arrested, you are expected to cooperate with the police in their investigations, and they may search your body and bags. By law, you can demand that the search be conducted in private, and body searches can only be performed by officers of the same sex. You also have the right to silence (to refuse to answer any questions), to contact your consulate and to engage a lawyer (but you will have to pay for one). The police are obligated to comply with your request but they may detain you for up to 48 hours.\nMost travellers who have got into trouble with the authorities are involved with illicit drugs. Drug laws are enforced more strictly in Hong Kong than in the West, and possession of even small quantities of drugs, including \"soft\" drugs like marijuana, will result in immediate arrest and a prison sentence of up to 7 years, while possession of drug paraphernalia can result in a prison sentence of up to 3 years even if no drugs are found in your possession. Drug trafficking is punishable by up to life imprisonment. Most Hongkongers tend to have strong negative views against narcotics, including soft drugs such as marijuana.\nDiscrimination is known to happen. People with a good educational background and reputable jobs are usually better treated by the police, while young people, those from developing countries and Western countries with loose regulations on drugs may experience more frequent checks. The police and the government are exempt from the Race Discrimination Ordinance. However, there is a law to ban any form of police brutality, including verbal attacks and any use of foul language. Call \u260f +852-2866-7700, or file an online complaint report to the Complaints Against Police Office and report the officer's badge number displayed on his/her shoulder. Although the Office is an internal agency of the police, speaking to them is the only way to lodge a complaint if your grievance doesn't involve police corruption.\n\n\n=== Traffic ===\nTraffic rules are strictly enforced in Hong Kong. Penalties can be severe, and road conditions are excellent, although road courtesy still has room for improvement. However, fast drivers create higher death tolls when accidents do happen. There is very little leeway for speeding. As little as 5 km/h above the posted speed limit can be ticketed by the police for speeding, though as much as 10 km/h is usually tolerated.\nSignage on the roads in Hong Kong is similar to British usage. Zebra lines (zebra crossings) indicate crossing areas for pedestrians and traffic comes from the right. To stay safe, visit the Transport Department's website for complete details.\nFor crossing without any traffic control, local people usually wait for vehicles to pass first. Vehicles are not required to let pedestrians cross first.\nCrossing the road by foot should also be exercised with great care. Traffic in Hong Kong generally moves fast once the signal turns green. An audible aid is played at every intersection. Rapid bells indicate \"Walk\"; intermittent bells (10 sets of 3 bells) indicate \"Do Not Start to Cross\"; and slow bells indicate \"Do Not Walk\".\nJaywalking is an offence and police officers may be out patrolling accident black-spots. It is not uncommon to see local people waiting to cross an empty road - when this happens, you should stay patient and wait because it is possible that they have noticed a police officer patrolling the crossing. The maximum penalty for jaywalking is $2000.\n\n\n=== Tobacco ===\n\nTo discourage smoking, visitors are allowed to carry no more than 19 duty-free cigarettes or 25 g of tobacco products. Offenders can be charged for cigarette smuggling and the penalty can be severe. No tobacco products are sold in duty-free shops to arriving passengers. Illegal duty-free cigarettes are sold in locations such as in night markets, but both the buyer and seller may be charged for smuggling. The police and customs service launch frequent raids. Once caught, ignorance is not an accepted defence.\nThe importation and selling of e-cigarettes and herbal cigarettes is banned. Smoking them is not an offence.\nCigarette prices in Hong Kong are the second highest in Asia, only behind Singapore. Cigarettes of popular brands can cost over $60 for a 20-pack (2021). There are also some slightly cheaper brands catering for smokers on budget. Hand-rolling tobacco is uncommon and only available in specialty shops.\n\n\n=== Corruption ===\nHong Kong is ranked as one of the least corrupt jurisdictions in the world by Transparency International, comparing favourably with the U.S. and the UK in this regard.\nCorruption is a serious offence. Attempts to bribe police officers or civil servants will almost certainly result in arrest and a prison sentence.\nMost companies and organisations have strict protocols regarding employees receiving gifts. Offering gifts or money to workers personally as a sign of gratitude might result in more trouble than is worth.\n\n1 Independent Commission Against Corruption (\u5ec9\u653f\u516c\u7f72), ICAC Building, 303 Java Road, North Point, \u260f +852-2526-6366. 24-hour service. Main office of the ICAC. A list of regional offices can also be founded here.   (updated Jun 2020)\n\n\n=== Hiking ===\nSee also: Hiking\nSeveral hikers have lost their lives in the wilderness. Hikers should equip themselves with detailed hiking maps, a compass, mobile phones, food, and adequate amounts of drinking water.\nMost areas of the countryside are covered by mobile phone network, and as long as there is signal from at least one Hong Kong mobile phone operator, dialing 112 has the same effect of dialing 999 in case of emergency. However in some places where there are no signal or where you can only receive Mainland Chinese signal, you cannot dial 999, even if roaming services may be available.\nEmergency telephones are placed in Country Parks; their locations are clearly marked on all hiking maps. The police also developed HKSOS, an app that allows you to contact the police even there is no signal. Trail markers often have codes etched onto the posts, which are marked on hiking maps, and might be marked on Google Maps. They allow precise location by emergency personnel should you require assistance.\nHeat stroke is a major problem for hikers who lack experience of walking in a warm climate. If you plan to walk a dog during the hot summer months, remember that dogs are more vulnerable to heat stroke than humans and owners should ensure their pets get adequate rest and water.\nThe cooler hiking and camping season in October to February is also the time of the year when hill fires are most likely to strike. At the entrances to country parks you will likely observe signs warning you of the current fire risk. With an average of 365 hill fires a year, you should take the risk of fire seriously, dispose of cigarettes and matches appropriately, and don't light fire outside of designated places. Offenders are liable to imprisonment of 1 year and a fine of $5000.\nSnakes are common in the countryside, and some are quite large. Most will move out of your way, but the small bright green ones are poisonous and stay still. Beware of them.\nWhile it's generally very safe to hike, the countryside can provide shelter to illegal immigrants and hermits, and a few cases of hikers being accosted and robbed have been reported. However, the police patrol hiking routes, and most major paths offer the security of fellow hikers. Some popular unofficial hiking trails in the New Territories may pass through the frontier closed area or military closed area. The map of the frontier closed area can be found here. Permits are required to enter the area, which are not issued to hikers. Live-firing exercises are occasionally conducted in the military closed area. Their coordinates are listed at here. Red flags are erected in the day, and red lights are lit at night during live firing exercises: stay away from the marked area. Intruders risk arrest and imprisonment for 2 years, or even injuries from gunfire or unexploded ordnance.\n\n\n=== Natural disasters ===\n\nTyphoons normally occur during the months of May to November, and are particularly prevalent during September. Whenever a typhoon approaches within 800 km of Hong Kong, typhoon warning signal 1 is issued. Signal 3 is issued as the storm approaches. When winds reach speeds of 63\u2013117 kilometres per hour (18\u201333 m/s), signal 8 is issued. At this point, most non-essential activities shut down, including shops, restaurants and the transport system, offices and schools. Ferry services will be suspended, so visitors should return to their accommodation as soon as possible if they are dependent on these boat services to reach a place of safety. Some restaurants may continue to operate with reduced manpower and increased price.\nSignal 9 and 10 will be issued depending on the proximity and intensity of the storm. Winds may gust at speeds exceeding 220 km/h causing masonry and other heavy objects to fall to the ground. During a typhoon, visitors should heed all warnings very seriously and stay indoors until the storm has passed. If the eye of the storm passes directly over there will be a temporary period of calm followed by a sudden resumption of strong winds from a different direction.\nThe city's infrastructure has adapted well to typhoons over time, and it is relatively safe place to be in even the most severe typhoons. Locals would be more concerned about when to go to work rather than any real life or property damage, and it is often said the mythical Lee Ka-Shing Force Field repels typhoons and forces locals to go to work under bad weather. Effects brought by typhoon are mostly limited tree collapse and traffic disruption, and are over quickly once the storm passes. However, flooding is a particular concern in low-lying areas like Heng Fa Chuen and Tai O.\nSome taxis are available during signal 8 or above, but they are under no obligation to serve passengers as their insurance is no longer effective under such circumstances. Taxi passengers are expected (but not required) to pay up to 100% more when a typhoon strikes.\nRainstorms also have their own warning system. In increasing order of severity, the levels are amber, red and black. A red or black rainstorm is a serious event and visitors should take refuge inside buildings, and the effects are comparable to a Typhoon Signal 9 or 10. A heavy rainstorm can turn streets with poor drainage into rivers and cause serious landslides.\nThe Hong Kong Observatory is the best place to get detailed weather information when in Hong Kong. In summer a convectional rainstorm may affect only a small area and give you the false impression that all areas are wet.\n\n\n=== Gay and lesbian Hong Kong ===\nHong Kong is generally a safe place for gay and lesbian travellers, and there are no laws against homosexuality. That said, Hong Kong is generally more conservative than the West, and public displays of affection are still likely to attract curious stares and whispers. Nevertheless, unprovoked violence or harassment of same-sex couples are almost unheard of.\nSame-sex marriages are not recognised and there is no anti-discrimination legislation on the grounds of sexuality. The age of consent between two males is 16, while there is no law concerning that between two females.\nThere is no obvious gay community in daily life. Coming out to strangers or in the office is still regarded as peculiar and most people tend to remain silent on this topic.\nHong Kong Pride holds gay pride events on a weekend in November every year, though the pride parade was replaced by an exhibition in 2023 due to fears of falling afoul of the national security law. The Hong Kong Lesbian and Gay Film Festival is one of the longest running LGBT events in Hong Kong, and indeed in Asia. Since 1989, it has brought various international and regional LGBT films to Hong Kong. The festival is usually held in November.\n\n\n=== Discrimination ===\nAlthough violent racist attacks are rare, discriminatory attitudes exist among the population. White people are the least likely to face racism, while discrimination tends to be more widespread against black people, South Asians and Southeast Asians.\nDiscrimination against Mainland Chinese, even those whose first language is Cantonese, also exists. Following the 2019 protests, animosity has increased, and a few confrontations even turned violent.\n\n\n=== Prostitution ===\nProstitution is legal in Hong Kong, but organized prostitution is not. What this means is that it is legal for individual women to provide sexual services for money, but operating a brothel or pimping is illegal. Therefore, much of the sex industry is in the form of \"one-woman brothels\", where women rent small studio apartments in high-rise buildings to provide sexual services to clients. The industry keeps a low profile, and is not a tourist attraction by any stretch of the word; you are unlikely come across it unless you go specifically looking for it. Legal sex workers are required to be screened regularly for sexually-transmitted diseases.\nSoliciting customers is illegal, so you should avoid the streetwalkers. Not only could they be subject to police raids, but the risk of contracting sexually-transmitted diseases also is higher with them.\n\n\n== Stay healthy ==\nThe quality of medical care in Hong Kong is excellent but expensive for foreigners who are not qualified to get a government subsidy. Foreigners on work permits are eligible for subsidised healthcare at public hospitals, but tourists are required to pay the full cost. In cases of emergency, treatment is guaranteed, but you will be billed later if you cannot pay immediately. As a tourist, you are required to pay $570 for using emergency services ($100 for Hong Kong residents). Waiting times at hospital emergency rooms can be lengthy for non emergency patients, since people are prioritised according to their situation. If you have a problem making payment in public hospitals, you can apply for financial assistance but you will need to prove your economic status to social workers based in the hospital.\nOne common cause of sickness is the extreme temperature change between 35 \u00b0C humid summer weather outdoors and 18 \u00b0C air-conditioned buildings and shopping malls. Some people experience cold symptoms after moving between the two extremes. You are recommended to carry a sweater even in the summer.\nHeat stroke is also common when hiking. Carry enough water and take scheduled rests before you feel unwell.\n\n\n=== Find a doctor ===\nHealthcare standards in Hong Kong are on par with the West, and finding a reputable doctor is not much of a problem should you get sick. Doctors are of two types: those who practise traditional Chinese medicine and those who practise the Western variety. Both are taken equally seriously in Hong Kong, but as a visitor the assumption will be to direct you to a Western doctor. Doctors who practise Western medicine almost always speak English fluently, but you may find the receptionist to be more of a challenge.\nSeeing a doctor is as easy as walking off the street and making an appointment with the receptionist. Generally you will be seen within an hour or less, but take note of the opening times displayed in the window of the doctor's office. A straightforward consultation for a minor ailment might cost around $150 to $500, but your bill will be inclusive of medication. In Hong Kong, it is normal to get your prescribed medicine directly from the doctor. Many clinics and hospitals will accept credit cards, but check beforehand since sometimes only cash is accepted. Expect to pay more if you visit a swanky surgery in Central. Check the directory maintained by the Hong Kong Medical Association for further information. Help finding general practitioners, medical specialists, and dentists might also be available at your consulate.\nOn Sundays, finding a doctor can be difficult, and hospital A&E rooms will have very long queues.\n\n\n=== Drinking water ===\nDrinkability of water varies around Hong Kong. The Water Board advises that the water is perfectly safe to drink, unless you are in an old building with outdated plumbing and poorly maintained water tanks, but drinking straight from the tap is a very uncommon practice. Most locals prefer to boil and chill their tap water before consumption or to use bottled water.\nBottled water is readily available everywhere for a few dollars, and comes in mineralised and distilled varieties. Hotel rooms typically provide bottled water, which you should use if you are new to the region. Empty bottles should be disposed at recycle bins.\n\n\n=== Pollution ===\nAlthough \"Hong Kong\" means \"fragrant harbour\", it is not always so. Air pollution is a significant issue. During periods of very bad air pollution tourists will find visibility drastically reduced, especially from Victoria Peak. People with serious respiratory problems should seek medical advice before travelling to the territory and ensure that they bring ample supplies of any medication.\nLevels of pollution varies by season and weather. The winter monsoon can bring polluted air from the mainland, while the summer monsoon can bring cleaner air off the South China Sea.\nThe air is noticeably less foggy after rainy days.\n\n\n== Respect ==\n\n\n=== Manners and etiquette ===\nHong Kong is a fast-paced society where the phrase \"mm goi\" (\u5514\u8a72), which literally means \"I should not (bother you)\", is used pervasively in a situation that you would say \"Excuse me\" or \"Thank you\".\nThe \"mm goi\" (I should not) mentality extends to a way that they don't want to bother anyone as long as possible. When you get a cough, always cover your mouth with the inner side of your elbow, as that area of your arm does not frequently come in contact with other people, thus avoiding the spread of pathogens. When having a fever, wear a mask. Spitting and littering, an offence subject to a penalty of $3,000, is considered rude because it disturbs others. Hong Kong is noisy due to its huge population density but adding more noises, which will certainly disturb others too, is not welcome. Speaking vociferously over the phone on the bus, for example, will be viewed as egocentric and boorish.\nWhen entering people's homes, always be sure to remove your shoes before you do so.\nHong Kong follows the British tradition in that queue jumping is taboo and you may easily get into an argument or be denied service if you do so. Everyone wants to go orderly and speedily on their way with the least disturbance. Even if an arriving bus is empty, and there are only two people waiting in line, they are expected to enter the bus in order of queue. Jumping a queue in order to ask a question is not tolerated either.\nWhen smoking in front of a non-smoker, always ask for a permission. Many smokers will just walk away to smoke, even in a place where smoking is legally allowed.\nUnlike public transport in some large cities such as Tokyo or London, where it is common to see passengers eat or drink (even in a cautious manner that keeps the surroundings clean), such behaviour is strictly prohibited in all areas of MTR stations, train compartments (except intercity trains), and most buses. This is due to concerns about maintaining cleanliness of public facilities. If someone asks you to stop consuming or even dispose of your food when you're eating it obviously (for example, eating a hamburger and holding a coke), just obey the request and reply politely, and you'll always be out of trouble.\nWhile Hong Kong has a generally good reputation when it comes to customer service, it is considered strange to strike up pleasantries with a stranger unless they are pregnant, disabled or senior citizens who are obviously in need. Saying \"good morning\" to a person you don't know at a bus stop will probably be viewed with suspicion.\nLike their mainland Chinese counterparts, saving face is a part of Hong Kong culture. Mistakes are usually not pointed out directly in order to avoid causing embarrassment, and it is generally considered poor taste to brag about your achievements or flaunt your wealth in the face of your less well-to-do peers.\nNaming customs and modes of address are generally the same as in mainland China, the main difference being that the names and titles are pronounced in Cantonese instead of Mandarin. See the Respect section of the China article for more details.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nMany world religions are practised freely in Hong Kong, and discussing religion with local Hong Kong people is usually not a problem. Contemporary Hong Kong is, for the most part, rather secular in daily life, though you are expected to dress and behave in a respectful manner when visiting places of worship. As in many other parts of Asia, swastikas are used in Hong Kong as a religious symbol for Buddhists, as well as for the Hindu minority, and have no connection with Nazism or anti-Semitism whatsoever.\nWhen visiting Chinese temples, take off your hat. Avoid pointing at the statues of deities with your index finger. Use your thumb or an up-facing open palm instead.\nIt is common for both strangers and acquaintances who are Christian to ask you to come to their church, although offence will not usually be taken if you decline.\n\n\n=== Traditional beliefs ===\nSome traditional beliefs can be observed everywhere. Many buildings are influenced by the Fengshui principles which refer to a decoration style that blends the Five Elements (Gold, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth) together, which will turn out to bring you luck, fortune, better health, good examination results, good relationships, and even a baby boy, according to their believers.\nMany buildings skip floor numbers with a 4 in them; this includes the 14th and 24th floors (which phonetically mean \"you must die\" and \"you die easily\") and even the entire 40s range (so the 50th floor would be directly above the 39th floor). They love the numbers 18 (you will get rich), 369 (liveliness, longevity, lasting), 28 (easy to get rich), and 168 (get rich forever). This also extends to the licence plate numbers on their cars; 1358 is avoided as it phonetically means \"you will never prosper\", while numbers like 2328 (easy to procreate and prosper) are highly sought after.\nHong Kong people love to joke about their superstitious thoughts but that doesn't mean they ignore them. When visiting your friends in Hong Kong, never give them a clock as a gift because \"giving a clock\" phonetically means \"attending one's funeral\". No pears will be served in a wedding party because \"sharing a pear\" sounds like \"separation\".\n\n\n=== Business ===\nWhen you give or receive a business card, always do it with both hands and with a slight dip of your head or you may be seen as either disrespectful or ignorant. Welcoming someone should also be done with a slight dip of the head and with a customary firm handshake, but there is no need to bow.\n\n\n=== Dress ===\nWhen the thermometer hits 30 \u00b0C, expect to see many local people wearing warm clothing - this is to protect against the harsh air-conditioning often found on public transport and in places like cinemas and shopping malls. This is actually wise, since the extreme change in temperatures can make people feel ill.\nIn contrast, when the temperature starts to go under 20 \u00b0C, people start wearing very warm clothing to protect themselves from the 'cold'.\nHong Kong women are known for their fairly conservative dress code, although wearing halter-necks and sleeveless tops is not uncommon and acceptable, while teenagers and young adults can very frequently be seen wearing hot pants or short shorts. Public nudity including topless sunbathing is prohibited, even on the beach. \nThe dress code for men, especially tourists, is less conservative than it used to be. Even in 5-star hotels, smart casual is usually acceptable; although you might want to make your own enquiries in advance before dining in those places. Tourists from colder climates sometimes assume that wearing shorts in the tropics is a sensible idea, but hairy knees can look out of place in urban Hong Kong.\n\n\n=== Sensitive topics ===\n\n\n==== Relationship with mainland China ====\nHong Kong has significant cultural differences from mainland China due to its heritage and the Sino-Hong Kong relationship is a contentious and complicated issue. Some locals consider the mannerisms of mainland Chinese to be crude and uncivilised, and are grateful for what they consider to be the civilising influence of British colonial rule in Hong Kong. Meanwhile, some mainland Chinese criticise Hongkongers for what is perceived as a lack of ethnic solidarity and patriotism, along with arrogance rooted in its history of British colonial rule. Some Hongkongers also feel that China is wiping out Hong Kong's unique culture and attempting to impose Chinese culture on them. Generally speaking, it is best not to get into a discussion about mainland Chinese with local Hong Kong people.\n\n\n==== Politics ====\nIn 2020s the controversial National Security Law and other national security legislations were imposed and made advocacy or discussion of certain \"red line\" topics illegal. Discussion on some political subjects can be touchy. Also, political opinions can be polarised. Some locals may be offended if you imply that Hong Kong is/is not part of China. As a general rule, it's best to just stay clear of the topic unless you know your listener well. And generally it's a good idea to use terms like \u201cmainland China\u201d (\u4e2d\u570b\u5927\u9678/\u4e2d\u570b\u5185\u5730/\u5927\u9678/\u5185\u5730) to avoid irritating anyone.\nHong Kong people are somewhat free to criticise their government, as long as their criticism does not touch what the government calls \"red line\" issues. High-profile foreign critics are denied entry. \"National security education\" is now mandatory in schools and universities. A handful of websites are blocked but there's no widespread internet censorship. The Hong Kong Public Library initiated a campaign to censor and unshelve deemed subversive books. Media organisations that criticise the government face legal and economic pressure from authorities.\nLocal political parties are broadly split between pro-Beijing and pro-democracy camps, though the latter has been much dismantled after the enactment National Security Law. While many desire universal suffrage, a right that Beijing has promised but refused to grant, some also try not to offend the mainland as Hong Kong's prosperity is thought to depend on further economic integration with China. The differences can also be observed on many topics such as the Tiananmen Massacre in 1989 and democracy in China. In Hong Kong, where information has traditionally been freely circulated and people are well read, political opinions are extremely polarised. Generally, the older generation is split, while the younger generation is overwhelmingly pro-democracy and/or pro-independence.\nA desire for stronger autonomy or even independence has been growing since the Umbrella Protests of 2014 by those increasingly frustrated by Beijing's reluctance to allow democratic reforms. Since the 2019 protests, all pro-independence and many pro-democratic lawmakers have been disqualified and expelled from the legislature, with many of them arrested under the National Security Law or seeking political asylum in other countries.\n\n\n== Connect ==\n\n\n=== Post ===\nPostal services are provided by Hongkong Post, which is generally efficient and reliable. Post offices are ubiquitous and coin-operated stamp vending machines provide service when the post offices are closed. You can also buy stamps in sets of 10 from many convenience stores such as 7-Eleven or Circle K (OK). Postal rates are viewable online.\nDue to Hong Kong's special status, mainland Chinese or Macau stamps cannot be used to send mail from Hong Kong or vice versa.\n\n\n=== Internet access ===\nUnlike in mainland China, most Western websites are accessible in Hong Kong. However, as of July 2022, the new National Security Law has been used to block some websites critical of the government, though no large-scale censorship is implemented.\nThe international version of TikTok is unavailable in Hong Kong, but the main Western social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram are available.\n\n\n==== Internet cafes ====\nInternet cafes have become rare as most people have smartphones and wifi-enabled devices. When available, internet cafes charge $20-30 per hour.\n\n\n==== Wi-Fi ====\nFree Wi-Fi is available at most hotels, shopping malls, coffee shops, the airport, most MTR stations, government buildings and some telephone booths.\n\n\n=== Telephone ===\nHong Kong's country-code is +852 (different from mainland China (86) and Macau (853)). Local phone numbers (mobile and landlines) are typically 8 digits; no area codes are used. All numbers that begin with 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 are mobile numbers, while numbers beginning with 2 or 3 are fixed line numbers. For calls from Hong Kong, the standard IDD prefix is 001, so you would dial 001-(country code)-(area code)-(telephone number). Calls to Macau or mainland China require international dialling. For the operator, dial 1000. For police, fire or ambulance services dial 999.\n\n\n==== Mobile phones ====\n\nHong Kong has a world class communications infrastructure, with a 5G network being deployed in 2020. Mobile phone usage is cheap and near-universal.\nHong Kong has many mobile operators. The best choices for tourists are Three, SmarTone and CSL. All operators offer prepaid SIM cards in micro, nano, and standard sizes. Recharging your credit can be done online with a credit card (Three and CSL will accept credit cards from anywhere) or by purchasing vouchers from retail stores, resellers, convenience stores such as 7-Eleven and supermarkets. Unlimited data plans cost around $28 per day.\nSince 1 March 2022, all new SIM cards sold must be registered with your name, and all existing SIM cards must be registered by 23 February 2023. A copy of your identity document or passport is also needed for registration.\nThe telephone system is separate from that of Mainland China, and using Chinese SIM card would incur roaming charges. China Mobile does offer its mainland prepaid customers a reduced rate option for Hong Kong; a fixed fee of 2.9RMB daily or 9 RMB weekly will reduce per-minute and per-SMS rates to mainland levels and incoming calls and SMS become free. Data, however, is separately charged at 30RMB daily for unlimited use.\nKiosks selling SIM Cards and renting mobile hotspot devices and mobile phones are available in the arrivals hall of the airport and at ferry terminals.\nAll mobile phone companies charge for both incoming and outgoing calls (similar to USA, but different from most European countries, Japan, Taiwan, or South Korea). Coverage is excellent, except in remote mountainous areas. Almost all operators provide a good signal, even when underground in such places as the MTR system, on board trains and in cross-harbour and other road tunnels.\nCoverage is decent across all Hong Kong operators, comparison of the coverage and speeds of the networks can be found on Hong Kong Coverage maps created by OpenSignal. In general Hong Kong has advanced mobile infrastructure with the second fastest LTE in the world.\nFor those traveling to the mainland, it is possible to buy SIMs with discounted pricing on mainland use. These are good to have if you need reliable uncensored internet on the mainland; due to the way roaming works, they are not blocked as a regular VPN would be during \"sensitive\" periods. China Unicom works on all phones, while China Mobile requires that your phone or internet device support the network technologies it uses on the mainland for 3G/4G access (TD-LTE and/or TD-SCDMA). China Unicom charges $68/500MB or $118/1GB for mainland data. China Mobile offers mainland data at $48 daily (throttled to 128k after 1GB that day), $98/2GB, or $168/4GB.\n\n\n==== Landline phones ====\nLandline phones for local calls are charged on a monthly basis with unlimited access, but be careful that hotels may charge you per call.\nPayphones are becoming rarer, but still exists in many MTR stations. If you don't have a mobile phone and need to make a short local call, most restaurants, supermarkets, and shops will allow you to use their phone if you ask nicely.\n\n\n== Cope ==\n\n\n=== Media ===\n\nHong Kong has a vibrant press industry and a wide array of competing newspapers. However, media organisations that are critical of the government face political, legal, and economic pressures from the authorities. Moreover, the national security law has made the advocacy of some political positions, including Hong Kong independence and sanctions from foreign governments, illegal. Some prominent pan-democratic media were also forced to close after their executive members were arrested under that law.\nThe Oriental Daily News (\u6771\u65b9\u65e5\u5831) is one of Hong Kong's most widely circulated tabloids, adopting an informal writing style and focusing on celebrity coverage. Oriental Daily News is regarded as heavily biased towards the Beijing government.\nAmong the broadsheet Chinese-language newspapers that adopt a more formal style and focus on serious news, Ming Pao (\u660e\u5831) is widely considered to be the one of the most credible, and adopts a moderate editorial stance. The pro-establishment Sing Tao Daily (\u661f\u5cf6\u65e5\u5831) is its main competitor, while the Hong Kong Economic Times (\u9999\u6e2f\u7d93\u6fdf\u65e5\u5831) is the main financial newspaper.\nThe South China Morning Post is Hong Kong's English-language newspaper of record, while The Standard, which adopts a more informal tabloid style and is distributed for free, is its main competitor. The online pro-democracy newspaper Hong Kong Free Press is also prominent and can be accessed for free.\nRadio Television Hong Kong is the Government broadcaster. Once given broad autonomy, it has been subject to increasing censorship by authorities. RTHK also make timely traffic broadcast (in Chinese), which is accurate and useful for drivers and travellers in general.\n\n\n=== Electricity ===\nSee also: Electrical systems\nHong Kong uses the British three-pin electrical sockets. Additionally, some hotels will have a bathroom with a parallel three-pin outlet which is designed for use with electric shavers, but might be used to re-charge a phone or rechargeable batteries. Electricity is 220 volts at 50 hertz. Most electronic stores will have cheap (HK$15\u201320) adapters that will allow foreign plugs to fit into British sockets, but these will not convert voltage or frequency.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe Chinese majority generally practises a mix of traditional Chinese folk religions and Buddhism. There are Hindus and Muslims, mostly of South Asian origin, and the territory is also home to several Hindu temples, mosques and a Sikh Gurdwara. Christianity is followed by 10% of the population, with English language services available all over the territory. Due to the presence of a large community of Filipino migrant workers, some churches also offer services in Tagalog. Protestants in Hong Kong tend to be strongly conservative. The Roman Catholic church is allowed to operate in Hong Kong. There is a single Orthodox synagogue, the Ohel Leah Synagogue, serving the tiny Jewish community.\nThe Falun Gong religion is permitted in Hong Kong, unlike on the mainland where it is banned. It is unclear how long this will remain true due to the aforementioned National Security Law.\n\n\n=== Consulates ===\nAlthough the embassies for China are in Beijing, the special status of Hong Kong means that many consulates operate almost as full embassies (but are not allowed to be called embassies) from the perspective of the traveller in terms of assistance and visa needs. A few (mostly Portuguese-speaking) countries serve Hong Kong through their consulate in Macau. We also list the representative offices of mainland China and Taiwan here, as they effectively serve as consulates from a traveller's point of view.\nAlmost any travel agent can also help you get a visa, and most can deliver it the next day. Of course they charge an additional fee, but it may be worth it for the convenience. The China Travel Service office on the arrivals level at the airport is often used. Keep in mind that you cannot apply for a Chinese visa in Hong Kong unless you are a legal resident.\n\n\n== Go next ==\nMacau, the former Portuguese colony and largest gambling haven in the world, is an hour away by TurboJet ferry (around HK$200) from the city centre (near the Sheung Wan MTR station on Hong Kong Island), or 40 minutes away by shuttle bus (HK$65) over the Hong Kong\u2013Zhuhai\u2013Macau bridge (but requiring another bus and an MTR ride to get to the bridge port).\nZhuhai in mainland China, across the border from Macau, is 40 minutes by shuttle bus over the Hong Kong\u2013Zhuhai\u2013Macau bridge or 70 minutes away by ferry.\nShenzhen, mainland China's boomtown just across the border, can be reached by high speed rail in less than 20 minutes. The MTR East Rail Line takes longer at about 45 min, but is cheaper, and more convenient for those keen on shopping as it terminates in the Lo Wu commercial centre. Another alternative, especially if you are starting from the island, is the ferry to Shekou, which takes around 50 minutes and costs around $100. Depending on your nationality and method of transport, you may need to pre-arrange a visa to enter Shenzhen. Due to the lack of space in Hong Kong, many locals head over to Shenzhen to indulge in spa experiences, which tend to be cheaper and offer more amenities than the ones in Hong Kong.\nGuangzhou, capital of mainland China's Guangdong Province, can be reached by train in around 45 minutes by HSR from West Kowloon station. If you are on a budget, many cross border buses are available throughout Hong Kong. The trip will take more than 3 hours, including going through customs at the border and changing buses.\nTaiwan, a common short-term destination for locals that is 1.5 hours away by plane. It is both a world-class technology hub and another great example of traditional Chinese culture.\nSingapore, a Southeast Asian city-state that is often regarded as a rival of Hong Kong, about 3.5 hours away by plane. Given its small size, a trip to Singapore by Hongkongers will almost always be coupled with visits to neighbouring Malaysia and Thailand."

        "title": "Buenos Aires",
        "extract": "Buenos Aires is the capital of Argentina and one of Latin America's most culturally significant cities. It is a city of beautiful parks and belle epoque architecture, a place of big historical events, and a city of intimate cafes and cosmopolitan nightlife. \n\n\n== Districts ==\n\nThe City of Buenos Aires has 48 districts called barrios (neighborhoods), which can be roughly grouped into the following areas:\n\n \n\n\n== Understand ==\n\nBuenos Aires means fair winds, or literally good airs, in Spanish. The official name is Ciudad Aut\u00f3noma de Buenos Aires (CABA; \"Autonomous City of Buenos Aires\"), and it's also called the Capital Federal (\"Federal Capital\"), to distinguish it from the neighboring Buenos Aires Province.  It is one of the largest cities in Latin America, with many cultural offerings, and is the point of departure for traveling to the rest of the country. People from Buenos Aires are called porte\u00f1os, meaning \"people from the port\" as Buenos Aires was founded as a port city to fend off pirates and other enemies. Buenos Aires is an open and welcoming destination that allows the traveller not only to visit the city but also have an exceptional urban adventure.\nThe city is geographically contained inside the province of Buenos Aires but is autonomous politically.\nThe city extends across a plain covering 19.4 km (12.1 mi) from north to south and 17.9 km (11.1 mi) from east to west.\nAbout three million people live in the City of Buenos Aires (the Federal Capital of Argentina with 202 km2 (78 sq mi). The city is divided into 48 districts or barrios (neighbourhoods). Together with its metropolitan area called Great Buenos Aires (Gran Buenos Aires), it is in the top 30 of most populated urban conurbations in the world with over 15 million people. The majority of Argentina's economic activity is concentrated in this single city and its surroundings.\nBuenos Aires always receives tourists from all over the world and offers a wide choice of cultural events, nightlife, restaurants and bars, for which you can expect good service.\nBuenos Aires has one of Latin America's biggest LGBT communities. There is a receptive attitude towards LGBT culture in the city. Same-sex marriages are legally performed and recognized in Argentina. There are many LGBT oriented businesses based in the city which extend to the tourism industry. For example, there are travel agents, various classes and nightlife events as well as accommodation catered to LGBT travellers. There are gay cruise ships and even a gay five-star hotel.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nBuenos Aires enjoys a temperate climate with 4 distinct seasons. Because it is located near the coast, extreme heat and cold are rare and the weather allows the city to be visited throughout the year. Winters are cold though frosts are rare. Though daytime temperatures are mild, nights are much colder. It is necessary to wear a coat. Dull, foggy and damp weather characterize winters in Buenos Aires although there is the occasional warm day. At the end of winter, heavy storms are common and they are popularly known as the Santa Rosa Storm, which marks the beginning of Spring. Spring and fall have changeable weather with heat waves pushing temperatures up to 38\u00b0C (100\u00b0F) and cold, polar air masses pushing temperatures down to -4\u00b0C (25\u00b0F). Even in November, temperatures can drop down to 2\u00b0C (36\u00b0F). Summers are hot and humid with heavy thunderstorms. It is the sunniest and least cloudy season. Heat waves can bring periods of muggy weather with high humidity, making it uncomfortable. However, these heat waves do not last for long and cold fronts bring thunderstorms followed by cooler temperatures and lower humidity, bringing relief from the heat.\n\n\n=== Talk ===\nThe Spanish in Buenos Aires is pronounced differently from most of the Spanish-speaking world. Most conspicuously, the ll sound as in \"calle\" and \"pollo\" sounds like English sh. The difference in pronunciation probably reflects the influence of Italian traders in the port in the 19th century\u2014many of the words that Porte\u00f1os pronounce differently from the rest of the Spanish-speaking world are pronounced identically to an Italian word for the same thing.\nMuch has been written on the Spanish language in Buenos Aires. It was influenced by the many nationalities that immigrated here, especially Southern Italians.\nIf you have studied Spanish, you will find these differences enormous. Also, vocabulary differs greatly from Iberian Spanish and other Latin American varieties of Spanish. So it may be useful to get an Argentinian dictionary or take some lessons in Argentinian Spanish before getting to Buenos Aires. Despite these differences, any person who is fluent in Spanish should not have difficulty navigating through conversations with Porte\u00f1os or other Argentinians. Anyway, most \"Porte\u00f1os\" (inhabitants of Buenos Aires City) speak a little English but it is very easy to find people who are very fluent, particularly if you stay around the tourist friendly areas.\n\n\n=== Visitor information ===\nOfficial tourism website\n\n\n== Get in ==\n\n\n=== By plane ===\nThree airports serve the metropolitan area. When searching for flights, the airport code (BUE  IATA) can be used to search all airports serving Buenos Aires.\nThe main airport for international flights to and from Buenos Aires is Ezeiza International Airport (EZE IATA), about 35 km south of the city center. \nMost domestic flights use Aeroparque Jorge Newbery Airport (AEP  IATA), a short distance from downtown Buenos Aires. Flight information for Ezeiza International Airport and Aeroparque Jorge Newbery is available in English and Spanish at \u260f +54 11 54806111 or the aa2000.com.ar website. Buenos Aires also has several small airports dedicated to chartered flights and private aircraft.\nThe El Palomar Airport (EPA  IATA) is a smaller airport located 18km west of the city. It offers a limited range of domestic flights.\nDomestic flights from Buenos Aires to the rest of Argentina are usually more expensive for foreigners than for Argentinians. This can pose a problem for short-term travellers who do not have time to take a bus to places like Iguazu Falls, Bariloche and Ushuaia. These travellers are often advised to find smaller travel companies or agents that can help find lower prices or deals that larger online travel sites would not have access to.\nPeople from other nationalities must pay a reciprocity fee on arrival at Ezeiza. The amount depends on how much the country of origin charged for Argentinians to enter that country.\n\n\n==== Ezeiza International Airport ====\nMain article: Ezeiza International Airport\n\n1 Ezeiza International Airport (referred to as Aeropuerto Internacional Ministro Pistarini / Minister Pistarini International Airport EZE IATA) (located in Ezeiza, Buenos Aires Province, about 30\u201345 minutes from downtown Buenos Aires by car). Planes fly from and to most countries in the Americas and Europe. Ezeiza is a modern airport with good services such as ATMs, restaurants, free (but slow) Wi-Fi and duty-free shops. For being the main airport in a metropolitan area of 14 million people, it is surprisingly compact.   \nTo Ezeiza International Airport, count about an hour by car (more if huge traffic jams, which are not rare, particularly on Fridays or if it's raining). If you want something cheaper, there are private coach and public transport connections.\n\n\n==== Aeroparque Jorge Newbery ====\n2 Aeroparque Jorge Newbery airport (referred to as Aeroparque, the Spanish for Airpark/Airfield AEP  IATA), Ave. Rafael Obligado (20 min away from the downtown area by car. You can take a taxi (AR$160) or bus from there.), \u260f +54 4576-5300 (extension 107/122 Information: 4576-1111). The smaller airport, used by most domestic flights.   (updated Mar 2018)\nServed by Aerolineas Aregentinas and JetSmart.\nIn Aeroparque, there are 2 ATMs. There is also a tiny change office, with a huge queue. Free (but very slow) Wi-Fi in the departure zone.\nFor budget-conscious travellers, regular bus line 33 stops a few metres from the main gate at Av. Costanera Rafael Obligado and goes to Retiro-Plaza de Mayo-San Telmo. New in December 2023, some branches of the bus line 8 also connect Aeroparque with Retiro and onwards. The fees are very low (<1 USD), but you need a SUBE card to pay.\n\n\n=== By train ===\nLong-distance trains are slowly returning to Argentina, but they are yet few in numbers and limited compared to the by inter-city bus network. There are no international services but using domestic train to get around have finally become a somewhat viable option again. Overnight services with sleepers are available from Bah\u00eda Blanca, C\u00f3rdoba and San Miguel de Tucum\u00e1n while there are daytime trains from Mar del Plata and Rosario. Most trains run 2\u20133 times a week. Ticket prices ranges from about AR$400 in second class to AR$1200 for sleepers. A full timetable and tickets are available at the national operator Trenes Argentinos. The best and updated site to check which lines are working is Satelite Ferroviario\nC\u00f3rdoba, Tucum\u00e1n and Rosario trains arrive at the central Retiro station located in the centro. While Mar del Plata and Bah\u00eda Blanca arrive to Constituci\u00f3n Terminal.\n\n3 Retiro railway station (Estaci\u00f3n Retiro), Av. Dr. Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Ramos Mej\u00eda 1430.   (updated Feb 2019)\n4 Constituci\u00f3n railway station (Estaci\u00f3n Plaza Constituci\u00f3n), Av. Brasil 1128.   (updated Feb 2019)\n\n\n=== By car ===\nYou can get to Buenos Aires from any of the neighboring countries by car, but it is far away from most of the borders. It is only common to travel there from Uruguay and Southern Brazil.\nThere are four main highways entering the city which connect to suburban areas and other national routes. As with the trains, the bigger and more frequented routes are centered in Buenos Aires, so you will have no problem driving to and from the rest of the country.\nHeading to the city of Rosario, you can travel by highway all the way (north access highway, then route 9). From here you can keep heading north on a good route (Panamericana), or turn right about 80 km from Buenos Aires and go to the Mesopotamia region.\nTo the west, you can drive to the Cuyo region using the north access highway, then route 8. Traveling out of the city on the west access highway, you can follow routes 7 and 5, which will lead you to the west and southwest, respectively. If you want to visit western Patagonia, route 5 is a good choice.\nFinally for visiting the Atlantic shore of Buenos Aires (province), you need to head to the southeast access highway and then take route 2, a very good highway to Mar del Plata city.\nYou can rent a car while in Buenos Aires, in the zones of Centro, Retiro, Versalles, Nunez, and Ezeiza.\n\n\n=== By bus ===\n5 Retiro bus station (Terminal de \u00d3mnibus de Buenos Aires), Ant\u00e1rtida Argentina Avenue and Ramos Mej\u00eda, \u260f +54 11 4310 0700. There are very good services covering the whole country. Generally speaking the more expensive the ticket, the more comfortable the bus will be. The most expensive tickets will get you seats that fully recline and you will also be served meals and drinks by an attendant on board.   \n\nWith an almost non-existent railway system and plane ticket prices that are somewhat expensive, the long-distance bus system is widely developed. Almost all long-distance buses use the huge and well-organized Retiro bus station on the northern edge of the city centre. The buses are mostly relatively new, however the roads they will travel through are relatively old; there are frequent services to most parts of the country and international bus services to neighbouring countries. A second bus terminal is situated in the Liniers neighborhood, but it is much smaller and not connected to the subway.\nYou may catch taxis from Retiro bus station, and the subte (underground) also stops there. There are many local buses that stop outside the station as well.\nThere are numerous operators. The basement level is for cargo and package services. The ground level holds waiting areas, cafes, shops and services including a barber. On the upper level you find a lot (close to 200) of ticket offices, or boleterias. The upper level is conveniently divided by color into geographic areas for companies which serve the place you want to go, including an international area. Look for the signs.\nCama Suites or Dormi Camas lie completely flat and some have dividing curtains. With these services, the seating arrangement is one seat one side and two seats on the other side. Semi-Cama services are laid out two and two, and do not recline as far. Companies usually have photographs of bus interiors. Make sure the journey you choose has the service you want. Most of their buses are double decker. You may also found out some bus classes such as Cama-Vip, Cama-Suite, Ejecutivo or more, just make sure to read info about it or look up photos of bus interiors, usually on websites about South American buses or websites with lots of info about Argentinian bus companies.\nBus travel times to Buenos Aires:\n\nMendoza: 12\u201314 hr\nC\u00f3rdoba: 9 hr\nBariloche: 22 hr\nIguaz\u00fa: 20 hr\nRosario: 4 hr\nSantiago de Chile: 20 hr\nYou can buy a ticket to practically anywhere in Argentina and departures are fairly frequent to the most popular destinations. Reservations are not necessary except during peak summer and winter holiday seasons (January, February, and July), but it is recommended to buy a ticket in advance for better prices.\nTo find out which companies are available for a specific destination you can consult online information system for buses from Buenos Aires to the main national and international destinations.\n\n\n=== By boat ===\n\nThere are daily journeys to and from Colonia and Montevideo in Uruguay.\nThree companies operate this service:\n\n6 Buquebus, Av. Ant\u00e1rtida Argentina 821 (1104) (D\u00e1rsena Norte/Puerto Madero terminal), \u260f +54 11 4316 6500. (updated Jan 2023)\n7 Seacat Colonia, Av. Ant\u00e1rtida Argentina 821 (1104) (D\u00e1rsena Norte/Puerto Madero terminal), \u260f +54 11 4314 5100. (updated Jan 2023)\n8 Colonia Express, Pedro de Mendoza 330 (D\u00e1rsena Sur terminal), \u260f +54 11 4317 4100. (updated Jan 2023)\nAll three offer ferries to Colonia and connecting buses to Montevideo, Piriapolis, and Punta del Este. Buquebus also offers a significantly more expensive direct ferry to Montevideo. For all three companies, tickets are cheaper if you book in advance.\nColonia Express is typically the cheapest option. To Colonia, it can be as low as AR$216.60 online and this is frequently available. However, it leaves from the small and dilapidated Darsena Sur terminal which is in La Boca. When arriving from Uruguay late at night, catch a taxi from the terminal area instead of trying to meander around.\nSeacat Colonia is the second cheapest option. To Colonia, it can be as low as AR$228 online though it is hard to get this rate and most will likely have to pay the Econom\u00eda rate of AR$328, the Flexible rate of AR$356 or Full Rate of AR$397. They leave from the much nicer D\u00e1rsena Norte/Puerto Madero Terminal. If you are already in Buenos Aires already there is an AR$277 rate available at the terminal. In low season, you may be on the same ferry as the Buquebus passengers who probably paid significantly more.\nBuquebus is the most expensive but most popular option. To Colonia, they have a cheaper slow boat as well as a slightly more expensive hydrofoil. Like Seacat Colnoia, they leave from the D\u00e1rsena Norte/Puerto Madero terminal. For about AR$36 you can upgrade to first class both ways, which includes VIP lounge access and a free glass of champagne. Highly recommended on the nicer boats (you can upgrade on board).\nD\u00e1rsena Norte is a modern terminal. Currency exchange, food, and rental cars are available. Luggage storage, in the basement level of the parking area, costs AR$50 and is not secure.\nThe Benito Quinquela Mart\u00edn Passenger Terminal, a few blocks away from downtown, at Ram\u00f3n Castillo street between Avenida de los Inmigrantes and Mayor Luisioni street, has tourist information, handicrafts shops, snack bars, and the offices for Migration, Customs, Interpol and Prefectura (Coast Guard).\nYou may also take a boat from nearby Tigre to Nueva Palmira in Uruguay. Trains leave from Retiro Station to Tigre frequently. Boat services to Nueva Palmira also connect to Colonia del Sacramento by bus.\nThere is also a service from Montevideo-Carmelo-Tigre-Buenos Aires  . A one-way ticket is AR$900 (about US$31), which is not cheaper than the competition, but you do have the option of taking the 8-hour voyage overnight to arrive around 09:00 in the city center. Get the tickets and depart from Tres Cruces in Montevideo. The price includes a bus to Carmelo, boat to Tigre, and another bus to the center of Buenos Aires. They often have very good special offers that include some nights in hotels in Buenos Aires.\n\n Grimaldi Lines (Freighter Travel). Operates a bi-monthly freighter link from Europe to South-America via Africa. Five freighter ships do the rotation and each accepts 12 passengers. The journey lasts about 30 days (60 days for a round trip) and port calls include: Hamburg, Tilbury, Antwerp, Le Havre, Bilbao, Casablanca, Dakar, Banjul, Conakry, Freetown, Salvador da Bahia, Vit\u00f3ria, Rio de Janeiro, Santos, Z\u00e1rate, Buenos Aires, Montevideo, Paranagu\u00e1, Santos, Rio de Janeiro, Dakar, Emden, and back to Hamburg. Only the stops in Europe and at Buenos Aires permit passengers to either embark or disembark. However, passengers are allowed to visit all of the visited ports. All the port calls are subject to change depending on the loading and unloading needs of the ship. Tickets for a cabin on a Europe to Buenos Aires trip start at \u20ac1,450/pp for a double cabin and \u20ac1,890 for a single cabin (more expensive luxury cabins are available). (updated Aug 2019)\n\n\n== Get around ==\n\nThe public transport in Buenos Aires is very good by coverage, although public transport in Buenos Aires isn't world-class (compared to the counterparts in Europe and East Asia) and it can be crowded during rush hour and the bus network can be confusingly complex. The metro (or underground railway) here is called the \"Subte\", which is short for Subterraneo (underground). The network itself is not very large, but reaches most tourist attractions of the city, and there is a large range of bus routes and several suburban railways used by commuters. Trains, subte and bus are most easily paid for with a SUBE card (AR$30), which is a magnetic card that you can buy at kioscos, some newsstands, and at every subway station. It will have no credit when you buy it, but you can charge with money in train/subway stations or kioscos (grocery shops) equipped with the relevant machine (they will likely have a SUBE logo on display). One card can be shared by any number of people since it is used only once, upon entering the transport (except on trains, where every passenger needs its own card). The card is also used in many other cities (e.g. Bariloche), so don't throw it away when you leave Buenos Aires, as your balance can be used elsewhere.\nSince February 2018, a multimodal system has been implemented in which increasing discounts are applied to the fare when doing connections, regardless of the chosen method of transportation. The second trip will receive a 50% discount, the third trip will have a 75% discount and so on, up to 5 trips within the lapse of 2 hours.\nSome electronic resources can help you find bus routes : the websites ComoViajo and C\u00f3moLlego (official and the most reliable app for Buenos Aires), or the iPhone App miTinerario. Google Maps Transit isn't always accurate when it comes to buses and many important lines are notably absent.\nFinding your way around is relatively easy. Most of the city grid is divided into equal squares with block numbers in the hundreds, using a grid system similar to  Manhattan, New York. Most streets are one way with the adjacent parallels going the other way, so beware that the bus or taxi won't follow the same route back. If travelling by taxi, tell the driver the street and block number, e.g. \"Santa Fe 2100\"; or two intersecting streets, e.g. \"Corrientes y Callao\".\nCity maps are issued by many different publishers (Gu\u00eda T, LUMI) and the local tourist authority. They are indispensable for those wanting to use public transportation, since they include all bus routes. As always, check towards which direction the map is pointing, because some maps are bottom up (South on the top of the map). This is true for the maps at the official taxi booth at Ezeiza airport.\n\n\n=== On foot ===\nWalking is a great way to get around Buenos Aires during the day. With the grid system it is relatively easy to get around and because of the traffic it may even be quicker than a taxi or bus. The larger avenidas are lined with shops so there is plenty to see. In the Micro centro calle Florida is a pedestrian shopping street where you can walk from Plaza San Martin to Avenida de Mayo near the Plaza de Mayo. It crosses Lavalle (also pedestrian only) which takes you to the Plaza de la Republica and the Obelisk. For safety reasons do not walk to La Boca; take a bus or taxi instead.\n\n\n=== By taxi ===\nTaxis are not the quickest way to move around the more congested parts of the city, especially during rush hour, as traffic jams are common. Still, you will find that taxis are usually rather inexpensive, convenient, and exciting (in a white-knuckled, classic-wooden-roller-coaster kind of way). Make sure to take the \"radio taxi\", as some taxis do no turn on the meter and will ask for a very expensive fare.\nIt is relatively safe to travel by taxis. For details refer to Stay safe. If you are uncomfortable hailing a taxi on the street you can have your hotel or restaurant call a taxi for you. You should always check the driver's personal information is legible in the back part of the front seat, and make sure they turn on the meter after they set off, to avoid any disagreement over the fare later. It is suggested to use small bills and exact or almost exact changes with taxis, since as with many large cities around the world, it sometimes can be quite problematic of getting changes back from a taxi driver.\nAs of December 2016, Uber is readily available. You will often have a 5-10 minute wait compared to a taxi which can be hailed in seconds, but there are few of the risks associated with catching a taxi as a tourist. Since taxi drivers are against Uber, it's not recommended to order an Uber from a taxi stop, or from other places with taxi lines, as some big hotels or the cruise ship terminal. It is never a bad idea to send a SMS to the driver to arrange the pickup location.\n\n\n=== By bus ===\n\nThe principal means of public transportation within the city are the buses (colectivos). Tickets must be bought on the bus through a machine using a prepaid RFID proximity card named SUBE, since April 2016 it is the only way to pay for transportation. You can expect to pay AR$8-9, each ticket price depending on approximate distance and rising in AR$0.25 intervals.\nIn case of an emergency, ask a local to pay your ticket with his/her SUBE and then pay him/her back: it is an unorthodox but frequent way to travel, but locals are aware of these difficulties and most of the times helpful. In no case will the driver accept money for a ticket; he (rarely she) will simply deny you entry. The reason that this is doable is because a SUBE card can be shared between multiple people and subsequently scanned multiple times when getting on a bus or at a ticket gate. If you are travelling in a group or a couple, it is possible to purchase just one SUBE card and simply scan it twice when necessary.\n\nThere are more than 150 lines covering the whole city. They work 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, but run less frequently on holidays and late at night. For each route the bus is painted differently making them easy to distinguish (e.g. bus line 39 has a chocolate-coloured scheme to it). The best way to figure out the bus system is using the BA Como Llego app, or to buy a Gu\u00eda \"T\" (which might not be up-to-date). It's essentially a little book with a directory of streets, which corresponds to map pages, and has bus listings on the facing page for each map. These can be bought at many kiosks around the city, or subway stations; once mastered - not a simple task - it is fairly easy for a seasoned traveller to get pretty much anywhere in the city at any time by combining two or more bus and/or subte lines.\nOn most services, board the bus and tell the driver your destination (or if you already know the fee, do what Argentines do\u2014just yell how much the ticket is); he will press a button instructing the SUBE machine to deduct the fare from your card, you will notice the amount to be paid on the display of the reader with the SUBE label next to him. You can then use the card against it and the payment will be processed, and the balance of the card will be shown. Please note that no actual ticket will given to you when paying by SUBE card. Do not use the card before the driver selects your destination, since he may still be in the process of processing your order and say \"no, todavia no\" (\"No, I'm still selecting the destination\", or \"not yet!\")\nYou can also use buses to move in and around the suburban area (Gran Buenos Aires), but navigating Buenos Aires' immense metro area (10 million people) while avoiding dangerous areas can be a daunting task. The suburban-only lines (you can differentiate them because their line numbers are above 200) have less comfort, and many of them don't run after 23:00.\n\n\n=== By Subte (subterraneo) ===\nThe city has a subway network (\"subte\", short form of \"tren subterr\u00e1neo\", which means \"underground train\"). It is very efficient and you can save a lot of time by using it. It is cheap (in 2017, AR$7.50 for unlimited transfers as long as you keep underground travelling throughout the network). If you need to be somewhere by 08:00-09:30 or 17:00-18:00 on a weekday, however, the Subte will be incredibly crowded and depending on where you are catching it from, you may have to miss several trains in a row before there is space for you. Once on board, during peak hours it can get very crowded. Factor this into your timing arrangements to make sure that you make your meeting on time.\nThe subte runs approximately from 05:00-22:00, except on Sundays, when service starts at 08:00.\nMany subte stations have interesting murals, tiles and artwork. The \"Peru\" station is the oldest subway station and still has the old trains that require passengers to open the doors manually. Transferring between lines is indicated by combinaci\u00f3n signs.\nRemember to know which way your destination lies from your starting point, as the network uses its cabeceras (head stations) as way pointers and it can get confusing which way is the one you are supposed to ride. If you happen to realize that you are headed in the wrong direction, ask a local if they know of which the next station with a and\u00e9n central (central platform) is, there you can easily get on the right train by just going across the platform.\nFor example, if you want to get from Palermo to El Centro using the D line, you will use the platform headed to Catedral because that's the one in Plaza de Mayo. If you instead go for Congreso de Tucuman, this one in Cabildo Avenue, simply wait to get to Palermo, Plaza Italia, or Carranza station and the take the other train.\nAs for the bus, you can use your SUBE card to pay your trip (simply swipe the card at the turnstile to get to the station). Also every station has a SUBE charging post, either automatic or attended, this can be quite useful because sometimes its easier to walk to a close known Subte station than trying to find a kiosk that charges.\nThe current network comprises six underground lines, labelled \"A\" to \"E\" and \"H\" which all converge to the downtown area and connect to the main bus and train terminals.\nThe A line used to be a destination on its own because of the old wooden carriages. It was built in 1913 making it the oldest metro system in Latin America, the Southern Hemisphere, and the entire Spanish-speaking world. The old wooden carriages have been replaced in 2013.\nIn the southeast branch (the E line), the service is extended by a trainway known as premetro, but beware, it goes to some of the least desirable places in the city. Premetro is AR$0.60, or AR$0.70 with a Subte Transfer.\nThe subte and premetro services are own by the city transport and operated by Metrovias S.A. authority. You can reach their Customer Service personnel by calling -toll free (within Argentina)- on 0800 555 1616 or by sending a fax to +54 4553 9270.\n\n\n=== By train ===\n\nThere is a good deal of railway connections to the suburban area and nearby provinces (commuter trains) laid out in such a way that it resembles a shape of a star. The quality of the service ranges from excellent to not quite so desirable, depending on the line; ask before using them at night time. They mostly cater to local commuters and not tourists, except perhaps Tigre branch of Mitre Line. The terminal stations are the same from suburban transportation. From Retiro station you can take the Mitre Train to the Tigre Delta. Those trains are modern and all of them have A/A. There you can do a boat cruise and see the wetland and recreational area of the porte\u00f1os.\nThe main railway terminals are Retiro, Constituci\u00f3n, Once and Federico Lacroze. From all of these you can then use the metro and bus network to get right into the center. The suburban fares are very cheap.\nMore information:\n\nMetrovias: Urquiza trainway and metro - Good service, safe for traveling at any hour.\nTrenes Argentinos: Sarmiento, Mitre, Roca, San Mart\u00edn and Belgrano lines. The Sarmiento line is the most used one. It is however overcrowded and can be very difficult to use in rush hours; also covers less desirable places. Mitre line takes you to some really beautiful places like \"Tigre\", a very picturesque small town with old French-style little houses and a beautiful walkside by the river near a theme park, Parque de la Costa in the north of the suburban area. Be careful as every line has its own branches, so be sure you are boarding the correct train, which would be the Tigre one (there are displays on each platform, and a huge display on central hall). Mitre, Sarmiento and most Roca trains are new and all of them will have A/A and loudspeakers\nTren de la costa (site available in English): It's a small, cosy tourist train which runs from Maipu st (change from TBA's Mitre Line, Mitre Branch, Mitre station) to Parque de la costa in Tigre, with stops in very exclusive zones such as San Isidro which is worth a couple of hours walk. As a tourist attraction, tickets are far more expensive than regular trains: one way daily ticket costs 16 pesos for non-residents and allows you to hop on hop off as many times as you want. Be sure to check their website as it offers a brief description of each station and its attractions.\nAll trains are paid with SUBE card, and in most cases you'll just have to approximate it to a turnstile, both when entering the departure and exiting the arrival one.\n\n\n=== By car ===\nIf you are truly adventurous (and a bit of a risk-taker), cars are available to rent in Buenos Aires. There are several things to keep in mind before renting a car in Buenos Aires. First, Buenos Aires is such an excellent city for walking that if something is within 20 or 30 blocks, it is often worth the extra effort to go on foot and get to know the city on a more intimate level. The terrain is flat, so it can be easily walked on. Second, if you aren't much of a walker, the public transportation system in Buenos Aires is cheap and efficient. It can get you anywhere fast! Third, and perhaps most important, the traffic in Buenos Aires is extremely unpredictable. Stoplights, signs, traffic laws\u2014for many porte\u00f1o drivers, are mere references. Picture yourself trying to get several thousand head of cattle to move down the street and stay inside the lanes, and you have a decent idea of driving in Buenos Aires. It's also very difficult to find where to park your car in many neighborhoods, and close to impossible in downtown. Do not leave your car parked where you're not supposed to because it will be towed away, and the recovery fee is very expensive. Many hidden speed control cameras have been installed lately (specially in avenues), so be sure to stick to the speed limit, even in routes outside the city. DO fasten your seat belt and have your lights turned on or you will be fined.\nIf driving outside the city, you should not only stick to the speed limit (which varies a lot depending on where you are), but have your identification and driving license with you, as it's possible that you get stopped by traffic control policemen. National routes are in a good state of maintenance, but be careful in province only routes as there may be unexpected and dangerous potholes in the pavement.\nThere is also the option to do private car tours. One (fun) option is to go for Buenos Aires Vintage Tours, which offers original Citro\u00ebn 3CVs to do the tour. Check Buenos Aires Vintage for details on available tours.\n\n\n=== By bicycle ===\nBuenos Aires is not the most suitable city for cycling. Traffic is dangerous and hardly respectful toward bicycles; the biggest vehicle wins the right of way, and bikes are low on the totem pole.\nHowever, a bicycling network has been developed and it's constantly expanding. Check the web site for the updated map. It also has the advantage of being pretty flat, which means you can cover good distances and you won't get so tired. It can be a very hectic experience, but by no means impossible if you have ridden a bike in traffic before. Be sure to avoid avenues, specially if busy.\nSome spots call out for two-wheeled exploration, such as Palermo's parks and the Reserva Ecol\u00f3gica Costanera Sur; on weekends and some weekdays you can rent bikes at these places. Here's some tips:\n\nIn Buenos Aires, traffic is really good at anticipating the green light: some cars/buses start going when it's still red, knowing that it will turn green in the next second or few.\nIndicators and head lights seem to be used randomly, don't be surprised if a car suddenly cuts into you without indicating first.\nOn one way streets, stick to the left lane to avoid the buses which go really fast and stop all the time as well as the taxis that go at a snail's pace and stop or change direction suddenly to pick up a fare.\n\n\n== See ==\nIndividual listings can be found in Buenos Aires's district articles\n\nBuenos Aires is a big city, so check the districts section for detailed listings.\nIf you are a fan of walking in green open spaces and parks in big cities like Buenos Aires, be sure not to miss a promenade in Palermo, a beautiful area in the northern part of the city. Here you will find not only open spaces to walk in but also a large lake where you can rent paddle boats and a huge flower garden that is free to enter! Although the Japanese and the botanical gardens and the surroundings are very nice, they are also very noisy as several major roads traverse the area. For a quiet, shady walk or jog head to the golf course north of the railway tracks.\nAnother great place to walk along and experience Argentine street life is El Puerto de Buenos Aires. Its personality however is quite contrasting during the day and during the night.\nLa Boca has the Caminito pedestrian street with arts and crafts. There is also a river cruise you can take from there where you can see a huge picturesque metal structure across the river. You can try and catch a rowboat to Avellaneda on the other side of the water for AR$0.50, but you will have to try your luck as the rower may not allow you on citing that its dangerous. La Boca is famous for Tango and you can often catch glimpses of Tango dancers practicing in the streets. If you fancy having a picture taking with a tango dancer you can but expect to pay a small fee. In addition to tango, La Boca is famous for its football, and you can take a tour of the La Bombonera Stadium where the buildings are painted in bright colors.\nThe prices for almost everything in La Boca tend to be 2 to 3 times higher compared to the rest of the city. It's very touristy since it is an enjoyable place with some authentic Argentine sights. La Boca is probably best to be enjoyed during the day when the streets are crowded and there are other tourists around, it is generally advised to be avoided at night.\nThere is no Subte to La Boca, but many buses go there.\nRemembrance park (Spanish: Parque de la memoria) a public space that is situated in front of the R\u00edo de la Plata estuary in the northern end of the Belgrano section of Buenos Aires. It is a memorial to the victims of the 1976\u201383 military regime during the Dirty War...pack some sandwiches and perhaps something stronger to relax on the hillside (and watch the planes landing overhead at the airport nearby) contemplating things after learning more about this tragic yet important part of Argentina's history that is a must visit for any visitor.\nThe Cementerio de la Recoleta: This is where all the rich families in Buenos Aires have their final resting places. Expect to see big ornate tombs. Be sure to visit the tomb of Eva Per\u00f3n, the daughter of an aristocrat and beloved First Lady who, despite having the most visited tomb in the cemetery, is considered by many to be too close toward the people for eternal interment in Recoleta.\nThe Palermo Viejo district: This is a trendy neighborhood with charming cobblestone streets, bookstores, bars, and boutiques; definitely better than the touristy San Telmo area for a nighttime excursion. The Palermo station, on D line, is the closest metro stop.\nSan Telmo: Best visited on Sundays when tourists and locals alike flood in to attend the weekly street fair and flea market. Be watchful for good deals, and bring in your own water, as it's quite expensive here. On Sunday nights, there is a tango performance in the lovely plaza, which is specifically for tourists. (Visit an underground tango club for the most amateur experience. If there is advertising, or disco ball, then it's not an amateur)\n\n\n== Do ==\nIndividual listings can be found in Buenos Aires's district articles\n\n\n=== Football games ===\nArgentina has a renowned football reputation and the sport is big throughout the whole country including of course, Buenos Aires. The capital is the home town of two of the most appreciated football teams in the world, Boca Juniors (which resides in Boca) and River Plate (N\u00fa\u00f1ez). A game between these two legendary teams is called the \"Supercl\u00e1sico\". This is by far the hottest ticket in the city and one of the most intense rivalries in the world, with violent confrontations between the fans being a regular occurrence, sometimes even resulting in fatalities. It is often necessary to buy tickets well in advance.\nAlso, the Argentine National Team is very, very popular. Tickets to their World Cup Qualifying matches can difficult to come by, involve waiting in very long lines, and should be ordered in advance for more convenience.\nArgentinian fans are known for their passion and the songs (which are practically love songs) which they sing to their teams. Even if you are not a huge football fan, going to a game is definitely worth it just to take in the atmosphere and to observe the fans singing and cheering. While this is an experience you don't want to miss while visiting Buenos Aires, it can also be dangerous for tourists to go on their own depending on the stadium.\nTourists are often advised to go with large, organized groups such as LandingPadBA with bilingual guides, in particular to a Boca Juniors game. This ensures that you can watch the game in peace and still have a great time. If you want to see a match on your own, the best choice is to see River Plate, in the rich northern suburb of Belgrano. Best to purchase a (more expensive, ~AR$900, 2018) Plateas (grandstand) ticket rather than being in the Populars (terraces, ~AR$350 prices, 2018).\nIn the Plateas you can safely take your camera and enjoy the show. Go with a friend or someone local you trust who knows not only the area but also supports the local side and is familiar with the way things operate on match day.\nPurchase tickets in advance or through a friend if they are a member of the club or supporters' section, also known as a socio. Often tickets are mainly sold out for the big times, but you can sometimes find them on sale on match day for teams like Racing, and as the ticket prices have risen only matches rarely sell out (except the above-mentioned Supercl\u00e1sico).\n\n\n=== Tango ===\n\nA trip to Buenos Aires is not complete without some sort of experience of the Tango, the national dance of Argentina. A good place to go and watch some authentic Tango is at the Confiter\u00eda Ideal Suipacha 384 (just off of Corrientes, near Calle Florida). However Tango is best experienced not in La Boca and on Calle Florida, but in the Milongas. A milonga is both a place where a Tango dance will take place, as well as a specific type of tango dance.\nMilongas take place either during the day or late at night. \"Matin\u00e9e Milongas\" usually start in the early afternoon and go until 20:00-22:00. They are popular with tourists who may struggle staying up until 05:00 every night. Inside a milonga, you will find many locals who will be more than willing to show you how to dance. The night Milongas start at around 23:00, but don't fill up until around 01:30. They may go on until 05:00 or 06:00. Some Milongas to note are: Salon Canning, El Beso and Porte\u00f1o y Bailarin.\nThere are many milongas held in different parts of the city every day. There's a free distribution guide called TangoMap Guide which contains all the information of the milongas day by day, including times and location. This guide also informs about tango teachers and tango shops, so it's the best reference for any tango lover. It is edited by Caser\u00f3n Porte\u00f1o, a Tango Guest House in Buenos Aires that also gives free tango lessons every day for its guests.\nYou can start learning tango through the group lessons offered at many studios. Some popular schools are at the Centro Cultural Borges, on the very top floor. It can be very hard to find the actual place as there are some stairs you have to go up, and then you have to go through a museum. Ask the security officer where the \"Escuela de Tango\" is. In the summer time the rooms can get very hot. The Centro is within the Galerias Pacifico, the American-style mall near Calle Florida on San Martin. The best way to learn, and the quickest, even if you do not have a partner, is with private lessons. You can find instructors who charge as little as US$40 per hour, all the way up to ones that will charge US$100 per hour. If you want to try the authentic style that the Argentines dance socially in the milongas, look up some of the milongueros who teach tango, like Alejandro Gee, Juan Manuel Suarez, Jorge Garcia, Jorge Kero. They will not only teach you traditional tango or milonga, but you can also find out a lot about the culture by hanging out with them. You can google them up for videos or in order to find them. Many of the more 'famous' instructors command a premium price. If you start taking tango lessons it will seduce and consume your life and you will then be force to make many pilgrimages back to Buenos Aires to dance.\n\nIf you prefer to start taking lessons in reduced groups and have personal attention, there are two tango oriented hotels with professional tango teachers who offer group tango lessons every day (free for their guests). One option is Caser\u00f3n Porte\u00f1o and the other one Tango Lodge. You can check the complete schedule for the tango lessons at their websites.\n\n\n=== Gaucho party ===\nSpend a night seeing what it is like to be a real gaucho. Live the life of an Argentine cowboy; ride horses, eat traditional gaucho foods, drink traditional gaucho wines, and dance like they used to do back in the day. A great way to get out of the city for a day and see another side of Argentine culture. Great for adults, kids, or anybody who ever wanted to be a cowboy when they were younger.\n\n\n=== Skydiving ===\nBuenos Aires hosts exhilarating skydiving activities within its clear blue skies. You can experience a 20-minute flight, followed by a 35 seconds freefall, and a slow descent of nearly 7 minutes to enjoy a breathtaking view. Discover a unique bird's-eye view of Buenos Aires and its expansive pampas as you dive through 3,000 meters (9,000 feet) of open air. There is no better place to feel the adrenaline of a tandem skydiving jump.\n\n\n=== Wine events ===\nArgentina is renowned for its excellent selection of wine. The most popular being Mendoza which is rated among the world's most popular regions due to its high altitude, volcanic soils and proximity to the Andes Mountains. The terrain seems to complement the European grape varietals with interesting notes not present when produced in other climates, this allows the Argentine wine to be positioned in a league of its own.\nThe best way to experience and understand the selection of Argentine varietals is a wine tasting, which is offered by quite a few companies and bars around the city.\n\n\n=== Polo ===\nArgentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world. The largest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Ca\u00f1itas. Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year. For news on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check Asociacion Argentina de Polo.\nAround Buenos Aires there are plenty of Polo schools. Most Polo courses run for a week and include accommodation on site. A popular option for a day-trip is Polo Elite, who operate polo lessons for beginners as well as guided trips to polo matches. They provide transportation for the 45min drive from downtown to their school.\nAnother option is Argentina Polo Day which runs professional polo games every day of the year, as well as polo lessons for beginners and pros. Its full day program includes also a typical Argentinean BBQ with unlimited wine and refreshment. The Polo Clinics includes also accommodation. Transportation is provided, for the 45 minutes drive from downtown to their polo ranch.\nPuesto Viejo Polo Days  is another option. These full day experiences collect participants from the city and take them to a luxury polo estancia in the countryside. They offer transport, snacks, Argentine lunch with wine, lesson, mini match, use of hotel infinity pool, and an opportunity to watch a full polo match.\n\n\n=== LGBT travellers ===\nBuenos Aires has become a popular destination among LGBT travellers. For international LGBT travellers, the \"Paris of the South\" has also become the gay capital of South America. Same-sex marriage is legal in the country and in the central districts you will find most people helpful and amiable. There are many gay-oriented services to help you make the best of your stay.\nIf you are looking for accommodations you can start by visiting BA4U Apartments which specializes in finding rentals for the LGBT community. They can also direct you to tours and services their clients use like Day Clicker Photo Tours  . While you are visiting you might also want to stop in to see Chef Mun at the popular closed door restaurant Casa Mun.\n\n\n=== Helicopter tours ===\nThe city of Buenos Aires and its suburban surroundings cover a tremendous expanse of land that cannot be easily and quickly walked, biked, or driven. That is what helicopter rides are for. You can discover Buenos Aires from a unique perspective: see the skyline of Puerto Madero's skyscrapers, the grid of concrete streets filled with taxis and colectivos or buses, the tourist attractions including the Obelisco, Casa Rosada, and Cementario Recoleta. Tour the skies above the human traffic on an exciting helicopter ride, a different way to explore the city.\n\n\n=== Golf ===\nYou might not think of it as you walk around this big city of skyscrapers, but there is some very good golfing very close by. There are many trips to the golf courses that make it easy and relaxing for tourists to enjoy a day on the green. . Packages include any greens fees, equipment and a caddie who you can blame when you hook that shot into the woods!\n\n\n=== Jewish travellers ===\nBuenos Aires is home to the biggest Jewish community in Latin America and one of the biggest in the world. There are many sights and activities specifically for Jewish people. There are beautiful synagogues, museums, monuments, barrios and history for all travellers to soak up and enjoy. Tours are given around the city to hit all the major Jewish landmarks. This is a great way to see a different side of Buenos Aires that many people wouldn't think about seeing.\n\n\n=== Spas ===\nUrban spas or day spas have flourished, some of them at large hotels such as the Alvear, Hilton, Hyatt among others. Furthermore, some green spas have opened shops and offer a great range of eco-friendly treatments.\n\n\n=== Medical tourism ===\nMaking medical procedures part of your overall vacation package is a growing trend, and since Buenos Aires is relatively affordable for Westerners, it is at the forefront. If you decide to go the medical vacation route, there are a number of firms that have established relationships with local medical clinics who can deliver a total package. Make sure you check out the credentials of the doctors and other healthcare professionals before making your decision. Buenos Aires is home to plenty of well-trained doctors with excellent reputations.\n\n\n== Learn ==\n\n\n=== University ===\nForeigners have been flocking to Buenos Aires to take advantage of the great deals. For those who come to Argentina, it is essential to know, for themselves and their children, that the country's education is considered one of the best in Latin America.\n\n1 The University of Buenos Aires. The most important school in Argentina and one of the most prestigious in Latin America. Founded on August 12, 1821, it depends financially on the State but it is autonomous, open, secular, and completely free. Furthermore, the only condition for entry is completion of the Ciclo B\u00e1sico Com\u00fan (also free, and part of the University).   \n\n\n=== Photography ===\nBuenos Aires is a great photography destination, offering a huge array of locations that provide something for everyone, whatever you like photographing, Buenos Aires has it all, an exciting street art scene, gritty culture, beautiful architecture, an intriguing and visually exciting food culture and inhabitants that generally, don't mind being photographed. Brush up on your photography skills at one of the colleges or private schools.\n\n\n=== Spanish ===\nMany people interested in learning Spanish choose Argentina as an inexpensive destination to accomplish this. You will hear Argentines refer to Spanish as Castellano more often than Espa\u00f1ol, as the Castillian dialect that is often called \"Spanish\" is actually only one of several dialects and languages spoken in Spain. Spanish in Buenos Aires is Rioplatense Spanish. The Spanish of Argentina uses the verb form of voseo instead of t\u00fa (Ex: vos sos estadaounidense). While the Spanish of Argentina is beautiful, it is slightly unusual sounding to the rest of Latin America. Generally, language schools will teach you standard Spanish, while also providing insight into local words, phrases, and quirks. You might also pick up a little of the slang of Buenos Aires known as Lunfardo, and is influenced by several other languages.\nThere are several options for studying Spanish. You can attend one of several fine schools, study individually with a tutor, or there are social groups where people get together for the purpose of talking in each other's languages to improve their skills.\n\n\n==== Schools ====\nSchools provide a very rigorous schedule, typically, of intense study. Universidad de Buenos Aires offers some options. Be wise, if you have spent three weeks in classes and find yourself getting overwhelmed, a week off will help your brain catch up. There is the occasional student who has been in classes for six weeks whose brain is clearly suffering from overload. The schools would rather keep you in class, so it's up to you to pace yourself.\n\nCentro Universitario de Idiomas (CUI). A language school under UBA's School of Agronomy. UBA's language schools are mainly geared towards foreign students who want to attend UBA, but want to improve their Spanish before doing so.\nUBA Idiomas (Laboratorio de Idiomas). Another of a handful of language schools associated with UBA.\nVOS Buenos Aires. A private Spanish institute, VOS has a more personalized, relaxed, and less rigid atmosphere than UBA's language schools.\n LyCBA (Lengua y Cultura Buenos Aires). There's one Spanish School that is specialized in the language for tango and addressed at tango lovers (even when they teach anyone interested in their lessons). Also has teachers who can attend to the place where the person is staying. \nEvents take place almost nightly in bars and restaurants throughout the city.\n\n\n==== Tutors ====\nMany very qualified teachers advertise on Craigslist, which is more known by foreigners on the Buenos Aires page than locals. Often these teachers have formal education in teaching language and prior or current experience in a school of language. It is also worth a shot to seek private lessons within language schools. \n\n\n== Work ==\nEmployment is available for Spanish-speaking visitors in Buenos Aires. Many foreigners work as translators, or English teachers. There's also a trend for technology and recruiting companies hiring English-speaking or bilingual employees.\n\n\n=== Call centers ===\nIt is very common for foreigners to work in call centers. There are companies that provide customer care and technical support services to many big American and European companies like Microsoft, Verizon, Vodafone, Motorola and others. If you speak just a bit of Spanish, you can get this kind of job. Wages in call centers are much less than in countries like the US, far lower than the difference in the cost of living. In 2007, typical wages were 1/5 of the typical rate for the same work in the US, while living costs were between 1/3 and 1/2.\n\n\n=== Work permit ===\nIf you wish to work, remember to obtain proper immigration status so as to be able to work legally. It is possible to convert your tourist visa into a work permit, but you need to bring with you a letter of good conduct from your country of residence and a birth certificate. Both documents have to have an apostille. You may find the latest requisites at Direcci\u00f3n Nacional de Migraciones. Some employers may still offer you work under less than formal terms, but be reminded that if you accept this sort of employment you may not receive the full benefits that are mandated by law and are actually 'helping' that employer break a good number of local laws.\n\n\n== Buy ==\nIndividual listings can be found in Buenos Aires's district articles\n\n\n=== Opening times ===\nShops at shopping malls and supermarkets are usually open from 10:00 to 22:00, 7 days a week. Non-chain, small stores usually close around 20:00 and stay closed on Saturday afternoons and Sundays except on big avenues and tourist areas. All of the main avenues are full with kiosks and very small convenience stores that stay open 24 hours. You will find no less than 2 for each 100 meters you walk. In the Recoleta area, several bookstores and record stores close as late as 02:30 daily.\n\n\n=== Money exchange ===\nMoney can be exchanged at Banco de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina at the airport and at any of the cambios (changes) along Florida or Lavalle, but, if you have the time, shop around for the best rate at the zone known as \"La city\". This zone is the banking district of Buenos Aires, and numerous exchange places are located right near one another. This means fierce competition and options to check the best rates. In addition to this, in this zone it is possible not only to change US dollars or euros, but also some other major currencies from Latin America (such as Brazilian reals, Mexican pesos, Colombian pesos), Canadian dollars, Asian (Japanese yen, Chinese yuan, etc.), and Europe (Swedish kronas, Swiss francs, etc.) This can mean a saving of time and money by not having to convert twice. Take into consideration that whenever you go to an official money changer, you are always required to present your passport. Copies might be accepted but this should not be assumed.\n\n\n=== Banks ===\nBanelco or \"Red Link\" ATMs can be found around the city, but banks and ATMs are few and far between in residential neighborhoods like Palermo. Try major roads near metro stations.\n\n\n=== Change ===\nChange is not a problem in Buenos Aires anymore since the implementation of the SUBE card for urban transport. However, if you haven't acquired your SUBE card yet, be sure to always have some spare change in coins, as these are required in large numbers for the bus (Subte and urban train lines do have cashiers).\n\n\n=== Souvenirs ===\nThe mate: It is a sort of cup made from different materials, commonly from a desiccated vegetal core (a gourd), sometimes with silver or gold ornaments; which is used to drink mate, the most traditional social non-alcoholic beverage. The mate is drunk in Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, and southern Brazil.\nOther gaucho items: Traditional clothes, knives, etc.\nLeather items: The cow is totally used here: meat, milk, sausages, and leather; all high quality. You can find coats and other leather products on Murillo street though the quality of the goods here varies widely. The best place to find high quality leather goods may be the malls and other major shopping streets.\nAlfajores: These traditional cake/cookies, often containing dulce de leche, are delicious.\nFootball Jersey: Football ('soccer' for Americans) is a huge part of Argentine culture, so it is normal to bring home a jersey to represent your time there. Shirts from River, Boca or the Argentine National Team are always very popular and make great gifts.\nTango Shoes The zona de calzados is just Past Diagonal Norte on Suipacha. You will see many shops grouped together that sell tango shoes. As with many things in Buenos Aires shop around and make sure you are not getting the gringo price. Men can buy excellent hand made leather shoes for around US$50. For those of you with time on your hands you can ask them to make you a pair. They will draw your foot on a piece of paper and you can design your own shoe for the same price. Do be aware that if they tell you that it will be ready in a week, that probably means about 10 days (or around 7 business days).\nHandmade Ponchos: The Native Americans in Argentina wear ponchos made of handwoven materials, usually distinct from other regions of South America. Some are seasonal, many are considered unisex. A good deal can be found, especially on the outskirts of the city.\nA Bottle of Malbec: Argentina is famous for its wine, and Malbec is the signature grape of the land. A fine quality Malbec can be had for US$8-10 per bottle and makes a fine gift. If you know nothing about wine, go to a liquor store and look for the same brands/years found in nice restaurants.\n\n\n=== Shopping districts ===\nFlorida Street and Lavalle Street (from 500 up to 1000) are for pedestrians only and is the place to find the majority of tourist's shops in the centro. At the intersection of these two pedestrian streets, there is often some sort of interesting street performance going on, especially at night.\nThe Palermo Viejo in Palermo has many shops that will appeal to young or artsy people (think New York's SoHo). Nearby is Murillo Street, a block full of leather houses.\n\n\n=== Book stores ===\nOne of the Porte\u00f1o's passions, which they are very proud of, is to read. Buenos Aires is believed to be the city with the most bookstores per citizen in the world, it hosts some of the biggest and prettiest bookstores of the continent, and it hosts some of the most prestigious publishing houses in the Spanish speaking world. Expect to see people reading at the bus, metro, at the park, and even at the streets! There are several options:\n\nSanta Fe Avenue offers not only lots and lots of clothes and book shops but also a nice atmosphere where you can walk along. You can start from the intersection of Santa Fe Avenue with 9 de Julio Avenue, and walk along Santa Fe up to the Alto Palermo Shopping (Av. Santa Fe 3253).\nOn Corrientes Ave. from the Obelisco (big obelisk in the intersection with 9 de Julio avenue) up to Ayacucho St., you will find a lot of cheap bookstores with tons of books mostly in Spanish. Some remain open as late as 03:00, seven days a week.\nFor second-hand books, try Parque Centenario and Parque Rivadavia's kiosks, both in the Caballito neighbourhood. Open from Wednesdays to Sundays, they offer a great variety of books, many long out of print, for convenient prices. You may also find food stands and a very relaxed and familiar environment.\nFor that rare, collectible, antique or hard-to-find book, try ALADA, the Asociaci\u00f3n de Libreros Anticuarios de la Argentina (Argentina's Guild of Antique Booksellers). In their website you will find an index of the most prestigious bookstores of the city, some of them of international prestige. Most of these are located at Microcentro and Recoleta.\n\n\n=== Markets and fairs ===\nSaturdays and Sundays are great days for the outdoor markets, especially in the summer.\n\n Feria Recoleta. All sorts of artisan products, from jewelry to shawls. \n Palermo, Plaza Serrano, Palermo viejo. M-Sa 10:00-21:00. comes alive in the afternoon with more artisan's handiwork and freelance clothes designers. Another nearby Plaza (in Palermo viejo) between Malabia, Armenia, Costa Rica and Nicaragua streets has stalls with items for sale. The \u00daltimo Taller at Jorge L. Borges 1975 (between Soler and Nicaragua streets) sells funky candles and street address plates and markers; there are charming cats, and photos can be etched onto these plates as well. \n San Telmo, Plaza Dorrego, San Telmo. On Sundays. offers tango and antique products. Defensa street from Chile to San Juan comes to life with live performers and vendors. The crowds are thick, so keep an eye on your possessions. \n Feria de Anticuarios, San Isidro (at the train station of Barrancas). Saturdays, Sundays and Holidays. has a nice atmosphere. It offers nearly 70 stands of antiques, from toys to books and stuff for your home. \n San Fernando, in Madero and Rosario streets (located at San Fernando train station, between Sarmiento and 9 de Julio). Sa 10:00-18:00, W 10:00-16:00. This is a market where you will be buying items directly from producers, with the condition that goods are produced with social and environmental ethics in mind. You'll find books, vegetables, handmade clothing, musical instruments, etc. If you plan to buy things, remember to bring your own bag. \n\n\n== Eat ==\nIndividual listings can be found in Buenos Aires's district articles\nSee also: Argentine cuisine\nWhile the primary food consumed by Argentinians is beef, there are other options in this cosmopolitan city. Italian food is pervasive but in neighborhoods like Palermo, pizza joints are seeing heavy competition from sushi, fusion, and even vegetarian bistros. Just about everything can be delivered - including fantastic, gourmet helado (ice cream).\n\n\n=== Meat ===\nYou will want to try asado (beef/steak barbecue) at a parrilla, restaurants specializing in roasted meats. There are expensive parrillas, and more simple and cost effective ones, In either case you will likely have some of the best \"meat\" you have ever tasted. The bife de lomo (tenderloin) is unbelievably tender.\nAs a matter in fact, the first regular refrigerator ship is the Steamers Le Frigorifique and Paraguay, that carried frozen mutton from Argentina to France.\nJugoso means rare (literally \"juicy\"), however the Argentine concept of rare is very different from that of someone from the States (perhaps its a tourist thing, but an American ordering rare is likely to get something between medium well and hockey puck). Argentines cook their meat all the way through, and they can only get away with this method because the meat is so tender that cooking it well does not necessarily mean it's shoe leather.\nFor Westerners, don't be afraid to order \"azul\" (\"blue\"), you will not get a blue steak, more like an American Medium Rare. If you like your meat \"bloody\", or practically \"still walking\" it might pay to learn words like \"sangre\" (\"blood\"), or to make statements like \"me gusta la sangre\" (\"I like the blood\"). Don't be afraid to spend two minutes stressing how rare you want your steak to your waiter- this is something no one talks about in guidebooks but every other American and Brit once you arrive will tell you the same thing, if you want it rare, you have to explain exactly how rare.\nOnly the most old school parrillas (grills) don't offer at least one or two pasta dishes and pizza is everywhere.\nParrilla Tour Buenos Aires leads walking tours around different neighborhoods of classic parrillas. During the tour, participants stop and sample traditional foods at 4 restaurants, 3 parrillas (steakhouses) and an artisanal ice cream shop, as well as learn about the history and culture around Argentine cuisine. The stops chosen tend to be hole-in-the-wall, locals only, establishments not in guidebooks.\n\n\n=== Pizza ===\nItalian and Spanish food are almost native here, as the cultural heritage heralds in great part from these two countries. Other popular meals are pizzas and empanadas (small pastries stuffed with a combination of cheese and meats). They are a popular home delivery or takeaway/takeout option.\nPizza is a strong tradition in Buenos Aires. It comes al molde (cooked in a pan, usually medium to thick crust), a la piedra (baked in a stone oven, usually thin to medium crust), and a la parilla (cooked on a parilla grill, very thin, crispy crust). Best places: \"Los Inmortales\", \"Las Cuartetas\", \"Guerr\u00edn\", \u00b7El Cuartito\", \"Banchero's\", \"Kentucky\".\n\"El Cuartito\" in Recoleta has a delicious \"Fugazzeta rellena\" pizza. This restaurant can be packed with families and friends even at midnight.\nIn \"Guerrin\", ask for a slice of pizza muzarella with a glass of Moscato.\n\n\n=== Vegetarian ===\nIn Buenos Aires, as in the rest of the Argentina, beef is served everywhere, and even items like french fries, pastries, and snack foods are apt to be cooked with animal fat. However vegetarians and vegans need not despair. No less than a dozen vegetarian oriented bistros have popped up in the last few years (notably in Palermo) and many spots popular with tourists offer inventive vegetarian versions of traditional meals.\n\n\n=== Sweets ===\nOne incredible and typical Argentinian kind of \"cookie\", is the alfajor, which consists of two round sweet biscuits joined together with a sweet jam, generally dulce de leche (milk jam, akin to caramel), covered with chocolate, meringue or something similarly sweet. Any kiosk, supermarket, bakery and even cafe is crammed with a mind-jamming variety of alfajores, and every porte\u00f1o has their favorite. Be sure not to leave without trying one.\nAlso, all bakeries offer a wide selection of facturas, delicious sweet pastries of all shapes, doughs and flavors, most of them of French, Spanish and Italian inspiration but with a twist of their own. Porte\u00f1os are very keen on these, which are generally served by afternoon, with some mate of course.\n\n\n=== Service ===\nDo not expect service to be comparable to large cities in Europe or in the USA. Don't expect your waiter to take your drinks order when the menu is delivered and don't expect the menu to arrive very quickly. If you want service, attract the waiter's attention. S/he will never come over to take your empty plate, etc., unless they want to close.\nPatience is the key. Argentinians are so accustomed to the relaxed service that they don't bother to complain directly to the waiter, but only comment toward fellow Argentinians. Speak out to the waiters if you feel it is appropriate.\n\n\n=== Budget ===\nThere are a lot of al paso (walk through) places to eat; you eat standing up or in high chairs at the bar. Meals vary from hot-dogs (panchos), beef sausages (chorizos, or its sandwich version chorip\u00e1n), pizzas, milanesas (breaded fried cutlets), etc. Don't forget to indulge in the perennially popular mashed squash - it is delicious and often comes with rice and makes a full meal in itself. It is perfect for vegetarians and vegans to fill up on.\n\n\n=== Mid-range ===\nYou can go to a huge variety of small restaurants, with cheap and generous servings, most notably the ones owned by Spanish and Italian immigrants. There are also many places which offer foreign meals, mostly Japanese, Chinese, Thai, Arabic, Spanish, and Italian.\n\n\n=== Splurge ===\nThe most expensive and luxurious restaurants are found in the Puerto Madero area, near downtown, heading to the River Plate.\nBut the nicer places in terms of decoration, food and personality are in Palermo.\n\n\n== Drink ==\n\nIndividual listings can be found in Buenos Aires's district articles\nThe main areas to go out are: Puerto Madero, close to the Casa Rosada. Safe during the day and night, due the obvious reason (Casa Rosada). At Recoleta area (close to the famous cemetery) there are also plenty of restaurants, bars and a cinema complex. This area used to be trendy but it is now mainly for tourists. Palermo SoHo and Palermo Hollywood are full of trendy stores, restaurants, and young and trendy bars. Palermo Las Ca\u00f1itas is another nice area close to the Polo stadium. Also, San Telmo has a very bohemian, and very fun, nightlife scene. Buenos Aires has a popular cafe culture.\n\n Confiteria Ideal, Suipacha 384. Ancient, authentic and full of character. (updated Nov 2017)\n\n\n=== Clubbing ===\nBuenos Aires has a great variety of clubs and discos that are open until late hours (06:00 or 07:00) and bars that stay open 24 hours a day. Have in mind that at closing times the streets will be swarmed with people trying to get home, so it isn't easy to get a taxi and the public transportation will be very busy.\nYoung teens are used to staying out and by-passing the little security, so be cautious when engaging girls in provocative clothing. They might try to hit off with foreigners as part of a dare with their friends. The famous Palermo Barrios (SoHo, Hollywood, Las Ca\u00f1itas or simply \"PalVo\") have many hip restaurants that turn into bars as it gets later.\n\nLate Night Tango Late night tango shows are also very popular among tourists and locals alike. They often include dinner, a great show, dance lessons, and a few complimentary drinks. The dancers are all professionals and bent on putting in their best shows every single night. These shows start around dinner time, but can go well into the night. They can be a great starting block for the rest of your crazy night in Buenos Aires.\n\n\n=== Rock concerts ===\nBuenos Aires has a tradition of rock concerts going on all the time. Most of the time top international artist include several dates on their tour in Buenos Aires. Football stadiums are frequently used for the concerts.\nBuenos Aires rock fans often claim to be the \"best crowd in the world\" and this claim is echoed by a number of international acts, including Foo Fighters and AC/DC (who in 2009 released a live DVD of 3 sold-out concerts, called Live at River Plate). They constantly jump, sing as loud as possible, do Pogos (they usually push each other while jumping following the music, but it's not a kind of violence, it's a friendly and common thing), they also do Moshpits, and sometimes, Walls of death. If you're not accustomed to this, don't try to get to the front row because there is where it happens. People don't stop for a second not even to take pictures.\nFans also go to the airport to receive artists and give them gifts, take pictures and ask them for sign things. They follow them to their car or van and sometimes they even follow it. Argentina and especially Buenos Aires have long had a thriving local rock scene, known as \"Rock Nacional\", which has produced numerous bands which have achieved popularity throughout Latin America.\n\n\n== Sleep ==\nIndividual listings can be found in Buenos Aires's district articles\nYou will be able to find a good selection of budget and mid-range options as well as more luxurious and expensive hotels. Accommodation is scattered around the city; some areas to look in include:\n\nCentro - There are budget hotels and hostels in San Telmo on the edge of downtown. In addition, lots of foreign travelers prefer to stay at hotels in Puerto Madero, the most secure area of the city, such as the Hilton.\nNorth - chic high-end boutique hotels, and the four-star and up crowd including the Park Hyatt.\nThere are hundred of apartments, ranging from economy to deluxe, and the prices are very good. As well as going through an agency keep an eye and an ear out for individuals who rent their upscale apartments by the day, week, or month. Many times these apartments are three times the size of a hotel at half the price.\nThere are many short-term rental agents in Buenos Aires (an online search will bring up most of them). However the availability calendars can be misleading, since the apartments are often advertised by multiple agents and these agents don't communicate with each other. Photos can also be misleading and street noise can ruin an otherwise beautiful apartment so do some research off and on the field before signing up. If you are flexible on the area it may be better to wait until you arrive before looking. It is also easier to negotiate discounts face-to-face.\nFor budget accommodation there is an enormous number (more than 150) of hostels. In the more famous hostels, booking in advance might be necessary, but you'll always find a dorm bed if you need it. There are several budget hotels where you can get your own room for no more than AR$55-75 per night. You will not find them advertised on the internet. They can be hard to find, but there are many. Walk down Avenida de Mayo near Caf\u00e9 Tortoni. Start from Avenida 9 de Julio (the giant, wide one) and make your way towards the Plaza de Mayo. Look on the small side streets plus or minus two blocks and you will find many of these places.\nUnlike most South American cities, the better Buenos Aires hostels will be fully booked at weekends. You can always find something, but if you want a specific hostel, book in advance.\nThe stylish and Bohemian Palermo Soho and Palermo Viejo neighborhoods are home to some of the trendiest small boutique hotels in Buenos Aires. These hotels offer the amenities of their larger international chain counterparts, plus a more personal style of service, often at a fraction of the cost.\n\n\n== Connect ==\nCaf\u00e9s and restaurants commonly offer customers free Wi-Fi, as do hotels, and there is a public Wi-Fi network in the city called BA WiFi.\nAll major mobile carriers (Claro, Movistar and Personal) have good 4G coverage throughout the city.\nThe Argentine postal service Correo Argentino handles mail and parcels, see here for locations of their offices.\n\n\n== Stay safe ==\n\n\n=== Emergency numbers ===\nGeneral Emergencies Line - Toll free call 911\nEmergency - Ambulance emergency service SAME (Immediate Health Emergency Service), Toll free call. 107\nTourist Ombudsman - Communicate with the Tourist Ombudsman, phone number: \u260f +54 11 4302 7816. To contact personally, can go to Ave. Pedro de Mendoza 1835 (\"Benito Quinquela Martin\" Museum) in the neighborhood of La Boca. Daily 10:00-18:00.\nTourist Police Station - Corrientes 436. \u260f 0800 999 5000 (in country only)/\u260f +54 11 4346 5748 (turista@policiafederal.gov.ar). Provides information in English, Italian, French, Portuguese, and Ukrainian.\n\n\n=== Crime ===\nMost people travel in Buenos Aires without any incident. Nevertheless, as with any large city, like in Europe, crime is an issue for tourists and residents alike. Conduct yourself intelligently as you would in any large city.\nThe most frequent incidents of crime involve pick-pocketing, distraction theft, and bag snatching. Distraction thefts commonly occur in public areas such as internet cafes, train stations, and bus stations. You should keep a close eye on your personal possessions and bags at all times, which is also why many inhabitants wear their backpack in front of them. In some public spaces you will find that chairs with webbing and clips to clip to your bag or purse to the chair. An aid in avoiding problems is, dress to blend in and avoid carrying lots of items. It safer to travel just the bare necessities in your front pocket. While using public transportation or walking around common sense should be used.\nIn a common scam one person sprays something on the victim like hand cream, mustard or the like. Another person tries to help the victim. There can be several people at once working in coordination. The object is to distract you from your belongings and, in the chaos, steal from you. Avoiding confrontation is their object so do the same. Ignore their 'help', just focus on your belongings and extracting yourself from the scene.\nAnother common occurrence is the slitting of handbags in crowded places. Be particularly attentive in popular tourist areas, such as San Telmo. You should avoid carrying large amounts of cash or wearing ostentatious jewelry.\nIf a woman (or even a man) apparently normally calls you on the street to see an \"apresentaci\u00f3n\" and earn massage girls for free, without commitment, the first time, do not pay attention and leave! In fact, they are agents of brothels. Once taken \"inside\", they do not let you out, physically preventing you, until they disburse a large sum of money. This type of scam is relatively common in the center, especially in Corrientes Avenue, Florida Street, and Lavalle Avenue.\nThe dangers of hailing a taxi has received lots of press but is not common. Petty crime continues (like taking indirect routes or incorrect changes during payment). Taxicabs that loiter in front of popular tourist destinations like the National Museum are looking for tourists, and some of these drivers are less honest than others. Do things like the locals would be a good choice, like stopping a cab a block or two away on a typical city street. Alternatively, Uber is widely available, although you can expect a 5-10 minute wait while the driver locates you and picks you up.\nArmed robberies in the street, in taxis and in restaurants are highly unlikely. In the past, kidnappings occurred, where victims are grabbed off the street based on their appearance and vulnerability. They are made to withdraw as much money as possible from ATM machines, the victim is usually quickly released unharmed. However, this is even more unlikely for tourists to happen.\n\n\n=== Football ===\nArgentinians are very passionate football (soccer) fans, and the local derby between Boca Juniors and River Plate, known in Spanish as El Supercl\u00e1sico is one of the most intense in the world, with violence between the supporters of both clubs being a regular occurrence. Be sure to avoid wearing the jerseys of either team whenever possible, and should you want to support one of them on matchday, be careful to avoid wandering into groups of supporters of the other club.\nArgentinians are also very passionate supporters of their national team, so be sure to avoid wearing a Brazil or England national team jersey, as doing so could make you a target of violence from local football fans. That said, it is generally not a problem wearing the jerseys of Brazilian or English clubs, particularly if it has the name of an Argentinian player on it.\n\n\n=== Rough spots and neighborhoods ===\nAs with any major city, some spots are suggested to be visited carefully, and others avoided entirely. Common dangerous spots are the three biggest train terminals at the city: Constituci\u00f3n, Once and Retiro. They are very busy and centrally located, so it is highly probable that a tourist shall pass by any of these. While mostly safe during the day, petty thefts are common, so be sure to keep an eye on your belongings, avoid any confrontation and be cautious; avoid them entirely past 22:00. The same goes with some touristy spots like La Boca or the vast city parks of Palermo.\nDangerous neighborhoods that should not be visited without the guidance of locals are Constitucion, Nueva Pompeya, Villa Lugano, Villa Soldati, Villa Riachuelo, Bajo Flores (not Floresta) and Mataderos.\n\n\n=== Counterfeit money ===\nCounterfeit money is frequent, especially from a regular exchanger of currencies from people of various lifestyles (like taxi drivers), so be on the lookout for counterfeit bank notes being given with your change. Some counterfeit notes are very well done and may even have what appears to be a watermark. Get to know the notes and exactly what they look and feel like, also identify the water marks and serial numbers. When exiting a taxi, hold up your notes to the light to check them before final exit, or better yet, use exact change in taxis (or use Uber).\nBe careful of counterfeit money. There have been occasions where genuine bills have been exchanged for counterfeit ones. Counterfeit bills are mostly fifties, given as changes. Hundreds are frequently given back to tourists by deceiving exchangers claiming that counterfeit bills were given to them, after they have switched the bill given to them with a fake one. Using exact or almost exact changes will pretty much solve most of this kind of problems.\nDon't accept torn or damaged bills, as they are difficult to use.\nCharacteristics of good currency can be found at the Argentine Central Bank web site.\nIn order to use a credit card to pay for items, you will also need an ID such as drivers license or passport.\n\n\n=== Ezeiza International Airport ===\nAs any large airports in many countries, there are records of airport staff stealing from the passengers.\nIn July 2007, Argentina's TV network \"Canal 13\" conducted an investigation revealing that several security operators at the airport are stealing valuable objects such as iPods, digital cameras, cellular phones, sun glasses, jewelry, laptops, and other valuables while scanning the luggage of passengers.\nAccording to the special report, security operators at the airport are supposed to check each luggage before putting it into the plane; however, some operators take advantage of the scanner machine to detect valuable objects and steal them. The report states that this event occurs every day. The stolen items include anything from electronic devices to perfumes and works of art or even expensive clothes (such as football jerseys or leather coats).\nTravelers and residents are strongly encouraged to place high-value items in your carry-on luggage to prevent any incidents. However, since these carry-on luggages will be scanned too before being carried into the plane, their insides are also at risk of being stolen. With the staff or accomplice distracting the passengers (usually when the staff is searching for any metal or other item on the passenger), while another staff or accomplice steal the items. Another extra accomplice from outside the airport will usually pick up the items later.\nWrapping your baggage and carry-on luggage when leaving and arriving is an idea, since for only around US$16.50. you can discourage robbers from opening (and probably breaking) it. However, for checked-in baggage, it can not be used for passengers exiting and entering the US, since the Transportation Security Administration demands that all checked-in baggage to be easily accessible. While wrapping a carry-on luggage will pretty much also deny you quick access to the carry-on luggage.\nBefore and after check-in, It would be better to carry only 1 carry-on item and place all of your items (including tickets, wallets, handphones, any metal such like a beltbuckle, and so on) securely inside and not easily accessible, requiring the entire carry-on item to be stolen and only 1 item to be watched upon. Travelling in groups will also allow you to divide the task of minding your belongings, one person or more can guard the belongings, while another one is being scanned by the metal detector.\n\n\n=== Stay healthy ===\nThe plumbing water in Buenos Aires, unlike in many Latin American cities, is drinkable straight from the tap.\nPublic hospitals are  available for tourists, with 24-hr emergency service, without charge.\nThere are many stray animals in the city. They usually do not cause harm, but be careful not to touch them as they may harbor diseases and you may not be aware of their temperament.\n\n\n== Cope ==\n\n\n=== Embassies ===\n  Australia, Villanueva 1400, \u260f +54 11 4779 3500, fax: +54 11 4779 3581, info.ba.consular@dfat.gov.au.

A medium-sized, student-centered city, La Plata is known for its array of plazas, its Central Park-like Bosque, and it's vibrant music scene.\nCapilla del Se\u00f1or - a quaint old town filled with memories of colonial times, it is ideal for a weekend visit. You can complete your day out with a bicycle tour, a hot air balloon ride or a trip on an old historic steam train.\nTigre - a town up the river delta where people can go shopping or take boats to go further up river to explore the habitat, with a quaint amusement park, a great crafts fair on the weekends, a multi-storied casino, and a beautiful river to walk along. A popular choice is to take a boat ride through the Paran\u00e1 Delta, ideal on a sunny day. It is an easy 45 minute train ride from the Retiro train station in the north east of Buenos Aires. There are many tours that go to Tigre, and it's a great place to get out of the city for a day and get some fresh air. The most popular day to go is Sunday, but there are things to do all week long.\n\nLujan - famous for its incredible (although controversial) zoo and its world famous cathedral. Other than that, it is just a great place to go for a day if you want a break from the city. There are tours all the time that can help you get there and show you where to go once you arrive.\nSan Antonio de Areco - located 113 km from the city of Buenos Aires, Areco is an old-fashioned village with quaint colonial architecture. Exploring the streets you will discover ancient houses with colonial fences and narrow footpaths that speak of historic times.\nMontevideo - Uruguay's capital, just across the \"Rio de la Plata\". You can get there by ferry that departs from the ferry terminal in Puerto Madero, at the bottom of Avenida Cordoba. Companies from cheapest to most expensive: Colonia Express, Seacat, Buquebus. Please note Colonia Express departs from a bit more south of the city than the other two.\nColonia del Sacramento - a historic town in Uruguay that can be reached from the same ferry terminal.\nCarlos Keen - a small town, stopped in time somewhere in the 19th century. A gastronomic haven, Carlos Keen is full of restaurants and tea houses.\nSan Isidro - an upscale neighborhood which consists of the old city zone, with colonial houses in front of the R\u00edo de la Plata, the area behind the famous Cathedral, whose gardens take over the tracks and lead to an open view of the river, as well as the areas around Plaza Mitre where time seems to have stopped. San Isidro is still the oldest and most traditional neighborhood in the area.\nIgua\u00e7u Falls - too far for a day trip but close enough for a 2-3 day trip and one of the world's most amazing natural wonders. Accessible via air (1 hr 40 min flight) or bus.\nMart\u00ednez - affluent suburb.\nAdrogu\u00e9 - a distinguished residential area 23 km south of the city, with numerous cobbled streets, lush trees and several squares."

        "title": "Shanghai",
        "extract": "Shanghai (\u4e0a\u6d77; Z\u00e5nhae in Shanghainese, Sh\u00e0ngh\u01cei in Mandarin) is the most developed city in China, the country's main center for finance and fashion, and one of the world's most populous and important cities. There are several ways to rate the size of cities; by the one Wikipedia uses, based on UN numbers, Shanghai is the third largest city in the world after Tokyo and Delhi. By any measure, it is in the top ten for the world and either the largest in China or second to Chongqing.\n\nShanghai is split in two by the Huangpu River (\u9ec4\u6d66\u6c5f Hu\u00e1ngp\u01d4 Ji\u0101ng), which divides the city into Puxi (\u6d66\u897f P\u01d4x\u012b), west of the river, and Pudong (\u6d66\u4e1c P\u01d4d\u014dng), east of the river. Both terms can be used in a general sense for everything on their side of the river, including various suburbs. However, they are more often used in a much narrower sense where Puxi is the older (since the 19th century) city center (#Downtown below) and Pudong the mass of new (since 1990) high-rise development right across the river from there (#Pudong below).\n\n1 Suzhou Creek (Wusong River). This is more a small river than a creek, a tributary which flows into the Huangpu at the north end of the Bund. It starts near Suzhou and is the outlet for Lake Tai. Within Shanghai parts of it form the boundary between Huangpu and Jing'an districts to the south and Hongkou and Zhabei to the north.Beisuzhou Road and Nansuzhou Road run along the riverbanks downtown; bei and nan are Chinese for north and south respectively.  \nShanghai is one of four cities in China that are administered as municipalities (\u5e02), meaning that it is not part of any province, and its government instead reports directly to the central government in Beijing. This is an overview article for the entire municipality. For the central districts which have most of the tourist attractions, hotels, restaurants and nightspots, see #Downtown and #Pudong below.\nThe municipality covers quite a large area \u2014 6341 km2 or 2,448 square miles \u2014 and has a population over 25 million, about the same as Australia and more than all but two US states and all but six EU member countries. Its GDP is larger than that of many countries, and it has the world's busiest container port. Shanghai is the main hub of the East China region, all of which is densely populated, heavily industrialized, prosperous, well supplied with migrant workers from poorer parts of China, and still growing.\n\n\n== Districts ==\nShanghai Municipality has 16 administrative districts, all with at least a few hundred thousand people, and Wikivoyage has separate articles for most of them. Here we try to split them up in a way that will make sense for travellers.\n\n\n=== Downtown ===\nThe historic core of Shanghai, it includes both the old Chinese city and the area of the International Settlement which began in the 1840s and lasted until the 1930s. It can be called Puxi (\u6d66,\u897f), downtown Shanghai (\u4e0a\u6d77\u5e02\u533a) or the city center (\u5e02\u4e2d\u5fc3). Today this area is still the core of the city. Most of the tourist attractions and many hotels are here, and many metro lines run through it.\nThe four downtown districts are:\n\nOf course \"downtown\" is not precisely defined; the four districts we have above are clearly the most central, but some definitions would include others which we list under inner suburbs below, and some would include parts of the Pudong New Area, perhaps everything within the outer ring road.\n\n\n=== Pudong ===\nDirectly across the river from (east of) downtown, Pudong has been a major center of development since about 1990, becoming a skyscraper-filled financial center. Pudong is listed here separately from the older downtown area on the Puxi side, but it might be described as an extension of the downtown core or even as the new center of the city.\n\nIn Shanghai's administrative system, the area Wikivoyage describes in the Pudong article is just the central part of a much larger official district called Pudong New Area, which also includes the less developed Nanhui to the south. Wikivoyage has a separate article for Nanhui, and it is listed as an outer suburb below.\n\n\n=== Inner suburbs ===\nThe inner suburbs all (except Yangpu) have direct borders with the downtown core, all are quite built up, and all have good metro service. All are primarily residential areas, but most have considerable industry and many offices as well and all have some large shopping malls.\nThese districts have some tourist attractions and several have hotels that are cheaper than those downtown but still convenient for sightseeing or shopping. Several have universities, and nearby areas tend to have many low-priced restaurants and bars catering to the student market; see #Learn below and the district articles for details.\n\nHongqiao Airport and Hongqiao Railway Station are in this area, on the border between Changning and the northern tip of Minhang.\n\n\n=== Outer suburbs ===\nThe outer suburbs wrap around the southern, western and northwestern sides of the city. The sea is on the east and south, while the Yangtze River is on the northeast.\nAll of these areas still include some farmland but large parts of them are already covered with residential and industrial suburban development and the trend shows no sign of stopping. What were once rural villages serving nearby farms have become towns, often fairly interesting ones preserving traditional buildings while hosting new high-rises and malls.\nAs of 2021, all of these outer suburbs have metro connections and bus services; see the district articles for details.\n\nThe beaches along the seacoast at the southern edge of the municipality \u2014 Fengxian, Jinshan and Nanhui \u2014 are popular as a weekend getaway for Shanghai residents.\n\n\n=== The islands ===\n\n\n== Understand ==\nShanghai is a fascinating mix of East and West. It has historic shikumen (\u77f3\u5e93\u95e8) houses that blend the styles of Chinese houses with European design flair, and it has one of the richest collections of Art Deco buildings in the world. There were concessions (designated districts) controlled by Western powers in the late 19th and early 20th century, so many neighbourhoods have buildings in various Western styles.\nHistory has shaped Shanghai's cityscape significantly. British-style buildings can still be seen on the Bund, while French-style buildings are still to be found in the former French Concession. What was once a horse racing track on the edge the British area is now People's Park, with a major metro interchange underneath. Other metro stops include the railway station at the edge of what was once the American area, and Lao Xi Men and Xiao Nan Men, Old West Gate and Small South Gate respectively, named for two of the gates of the old Chinese walled city.\nShanghai is definitely a cosmopolitan city by Chinese standards, although it is less diverse than many western cities. The population was 23 million as of the 2010 census; 9 million (almost 40%) of those were migrants, people from elsewhere in China who have come to find work or to attend one of Shanghai's many educational institutions. There is also a substantial international contingent: 208,300 foreigners lived in Shanghai as of 2010, slightly over a third of the national total of 594,000. There are services catering to these migrants \u2014 restaurants with food from anywhere in China for the migrants (in particular, much good cheap Sichuan food and West-of-China noodles) and a variety of grocery stores, restaurants and bars that cater to the foreigners.\nGroups of refugees from other parts of the world have sometimes arrived in Shanghai. One group were White Russians fleeing the 1917 revolution; in the 1920s the French Concession had more Russians than French (and of course more Chinese than both of those together). Another group were Jews leaving Germany in the 1930s; they mainly settled in Hongkou, a district that already had many Jews. After Japan took over Korea in 1910 and Manchuria in 1931, Shanghai received refugees from both regions.\nThere is an Encyclopedia of Shanghai, in English, that is available both as a book in local bookstores and online at the municipal government site. Much of it is rather boring \u2014 statistics, photos of the officials in charge of each development project, and project descriptions that give much financial and engineering detail \u2014 but there is also some quite useful material. For example, it has detailed descriptions of every museum and park in the city.\n\n\n=== Economy ===\nShanghai is strategically positioned: near the geographic center of China, at the mouth of the great Yangtze River and surrounded by fertile delta land. It has been a trading city for a thousand years and one of China's main centers of trade since the 1840s; today it is a major transport hub. It has the world's busiest container port and additional port facilities are under development. Shanghai's Pudong Airport is a global air hub and ranks third on a list of China's busiest airports, behind Beijing and Guangzhou. Shanghai's other airport, Hongqiao, ranks fourth. The city is also very well connected by both road and rail.\nShanghai is also one of the main industrial centers of China, and the municipal government has set up a number of industrial zones to encourage additional development. GDP was $670 billion in 2023, less than the US or China, about the same as Japan, Germany or California, and more than any other country.\nAccording to a saying, \"Shanghai is heaven for the rich, hell for the poor.\" People from all over China flock to Shanghai \u2014 everyone from farmers seeking jobs in manual labour to university graduates seeking to start a career or wanting to live in a cool up-tempo city. About 40% of the population, 9 million out of 23, are migrants from other parts of China. Real estate prices, especially in central areas, have skyrocketed in the past few years; rents are among the highest in the world and even well-off people complain that buying a home is becoming impossible.\nThe surrounding East China region is populous, prosperous, highly developed, and still growing. Shanghai plays an important role as the center of that region.\n\n\n=== History ===\nWhile the area has been inhabited since prehistoric times and there has been a town at least since the Song Dynasty, a thousand years or so ago, Shanghai only rose to prominence after China lost the First Opium War in 1842. Shanghai was one of the five cities which China was forced to open to Western trade as treaty ports. Shanghai grew amazingly after that; until then nearby cities like Hangzhou, Suzhou and Nanjing had been far more important, but since the late 19th century Shanghai has been the center of the region.\nBy the early 20th century, Shanghai was the largest and most prosperous city in the Far East, and one of the wildest. With the opening up of China since the late 1970s, Shanghai has regained much of its former glory and has surpassed it in many ways; the pace of development being absolutely furious. Today, Shanghai is again one of the largest and most prosperous cities in Asia, though not nearly as wild as it once was. It is now a very attractive city for travellers from all over the world, and a major destination for both tourism and business. A Forbes article ranks Shanghai as the world's 14th most visited city, with 6.5 million visitors in 2012.\n\nFrom the early 1840s to the late 1930s parts of Shanghai were concessions, areas administered by foreign powers. Eight nations\u2014Britain, France, the US, Germany, Italy, Russia, Austria-Hungary, and Japan\u2014had concessions in Shanghai, areas that they controlled and where Chinese law did not apply. Most of these were jointly administered as the \"International Settlement\", but the French ran theirs separately. In all of them, the population was mainly Chinese but there were also many foreigners, and the government and legal system were foreign. The police included many Sikhs and some French gendarmes.\nMany important Chinese lived in the concession areas. Chairman Mao's Shanghai house is now a museum in Jing'an District, while both the houses of several other leaders and the site of the first national meeting of the Communist Party are now museums in the French Concession.\nToday most of the former concession areas are parts of downtown Shanghai, listed at #Downtown above.\n\n\"Central District\" on the old map was British and the center of colonial Shanghai. It corresponds roughly to the modern district Huangpu.\nThe horse-racing track on the edge of that area is now People's Square, considered the center of modern Shanghai.\n\"Western District\" was mostly British but also included the Italian Concession. It corresponds roughly to Jing'an.\n\"French Settlement\" on the old map corresponds roughly to Luwan District; the Concession later expanded westward to include Xuhui District, and our French Concession article covers both.\n\"The Bund\" was mostly British, though parts of it were in the American concession.\nHongkou was the site of the former Japanese concession.\nThe \"Chinese City\" was the walled city of Shanghai for hundreds of years before the modern city developed around it. It has its own Wikivoyage article, Old City.\n\"Northern District\" and \"Eastern District\" were once the American Concession; today they are parts of Zhabei and Hongkou, respectively. They receive fewer visitors than the districts mentioned above, but they do have some attractions and the Shanghai Railway Station is in Zhabei. These are listed under #Inner suburbs.\nShanghai reached its zenith in 1920s and 30s and was at that time the most prosperous city in East Asia. On the other hand, the streets were largely ruled by the triads (Chinese gangs) during that period, with the triads sometimes battling for control of parts of Shanghai. That period has been greatly romanticised in many modern films and television serials, one of the most famous being The Bund, which was produced by Hong Kong's TVB in 1980. Shanghai also became the main center of Chinese entertainment during that period, with many films and songs produced in Shanghai.\n\nShanghai was occupied by the Japanese in 1937 after a bitter battle lasting several months; see Pacific War#China for the context. Japan and its puppet regime remained in control until 1945 and, as with elsewhere in China, life in Shanghai at that time was very difficult.\nThe foreign concessions were removed after the war, and trade resumed. After the Communist victory in the civil war in 1949, many of the people involved in the entertainment industry, as well as much of the upper class and intellectuals, fled to Hong Kong and Taiwan. Shanghai's days of glory were \u2014 temporarily as it turned out \u2014 over. That said, during the planned economy era, Shanghai was still a major industrial hub producing goods from milk candy to cargo ships, and was a major tax contributor among the provinces.\nSince China's \"reform and opening up\", starting under Deng Xiaoping around 1978, Shanghai is once again a great industrial city and trading port, and in many ways has surpassed the old glory days. In the 1990s, the Shanghai government launched a series of new strategies to attract foreign investment. The biggest move was to create a  Special Economic Zone called Pudong New Area with a range of government measures to encourage investment. This includes nearly all of Shanghai east of the river.\nThe strategies for growth have been extremely successful; in twenty years downtown Pudong changed from a predominantly rural area to having more skyscrapers than New York, including several of the tallest in the world. Pudong is now home to many financial institutions which used to have their main offices across the Huangpu river on the Bund.\nToday, Shanghai's goal is to develop into a world-class financial and economic center, and it is already well on its way. In achieving this goal, Shanghai faces competition from Hong Kong, which has the advantages of a stronger legal system and greater banking and service expertise. However, Shanghai has stronger links to the Chinese interior and to the central government, in addition to a stronger manufacturing and technology base. Shanghai has increased its role in finance and banking, with many international corporations having built their Chinese or even Asia/Pacific headquarters in the city, fueling demand for a highly educated and cosmopolitan workforce.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nShanghai has a humid subtropical climate. Cities at roughly comparable latitude (just over 30\u00b0) include New Orleans, Cairo and Perth.\nSpring can feature lengthy periods of cloudy and rainy weather.\nSummer temperatures often surpass 35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F) with very high humidity, which means that you will perspire a lot and should take lots of changes of clothing or plan on shopping for clothing during the visit. Thunderstorms also occur relatively often during the summer. There is some risk of typhoons in their July\u2013September season, however they are not common.\nAutumn is generally mild with warm and sunny weather.\nDuring winter, temperatures rarely rise above 10 \u00b0C (50 \u00b0F) during the day and often fall below 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) at night. Snowfall is rare, typically occurring only once every few years, but transportation networks can sometimes be disrupted in the event of a sudden snowstorm. Despite the fact that winter temperatures in Shanghai are not particularly low, the wind chill factor combined with the high humidity can actually make it feel less comfortable than some much colder places that experience frequent snowfalls. Also, back in Mao's era the official rule was that north of the Yangtze buildings were heated in winter but south of it they were not; Shanghai is on the south bank so many older buildings do not have heating.\n\n\n== Talk ==\n\n\n=== Chinese speakers ===\nThe native language of most locals, Shanghainese or Wu dialect, is not mutually intelligible with Mandarin, Cantonese, Minnan (Taiwanese/Hokkien) or any other forms of Chinese. The use of Shanghainese as the de facto 'first' language of the city has been decreasing both due to the use of Mandarin in mass media and education, and because Shanghai has many migrant workers from other parts of China who do not speak Shanghainese. As with elsewhere in China, Mandarin is the lingua franca. As Shanghai has been China's main commercial centre since the 1920s, all locals who can speak Shanghainese can also speak Mandarin, so you will have no problems speaking Mandarin to locals. Nevertheless, attempts to speak Shanghainese are appreciated, and can help endear you to local people.\nWu speakers have a particular accent when speaking Mandarin. Mandarin is heavily tone-based and speakers from Beijing can easily be understood (most textbooks are based on their accent or an approximation). Shanghainese speakers have appropriated some of the features of Wu onto their Mandarin. While in other languages this would not be a problem, given the phonemic and tonal nature inherent to Mandarin, the slightest shift in pronunciation can make it much more difficult to understand. The best thing to do is say \"\u8bf4\u6162\u4e00\u70b9\" (shu\u014d m\u00e0n y\u012b di\u01cen) which means \"speak a little slower\".\n\n\n=== Non-Chinese speakers ===\nAs English is compulsory in Chinese schools, an increasing number of people know at least basic English. You will probably find that most people in the tourist industry have a rather good command of it, and so do many in service positions, i.e. in shops, gastronomy and even sales clerks at metro stations. English is probably better understood than spoken by many, and the Chinese are notoriously afraid of shaming themselves in public, so make sure your questions are clear and can be easily answered.\nTwo traits of Shanghai residents are of assistance - one is the traditional Chinese hospitality, with most people genuinely wanting to help when asked, and the Shanghainese robustness. When necessary, do not be afraid to approach even the unlikely elderly person with an arsenal of well-thought-through and clear hand gestures, notes in Chinese, maps or photos. In the worst case, look for a younger person and/or somebody in a senior position, as both are more probable to have better English knowledge and will feel more confident when dealing with a foreigner.\nEveryday spoken Chinese is a rather simple language, so most people will not be offended if you dispose of pleasantries in your English as well and focus on the most important parts of your message, e.g. \"Where is subway station?\" will probably work better than \"Would you be so kind and direct me to the nearest subway station if you will?\".\nFor bargaining in stores, calculators are often used to \"discuss\" prices. Savvy shop owners in tourist-frequented areas equip their personnel with them, but do not be afraid to pull up one (or a calculator app on your phone) for the purpose if the other party doesn't. Remember that \"4\" is an unlucky number and prices containing it should be avoided, which you can use to your advantage (e.g. proposing \"39\" instead of 40-whatever).\nDo note that taxi and Uber drivers are often either elderly or recruited from the working class or migrant populations, and thus, as a group, have lower-than-average knowledge of English. Therefore it is recommended to have your destinations and hotel address written in Chinese for them. Some hotels even provide small brochures with both the hotel name and address and those of the key landmarks written in both English and Simplified Chinese for the purpose.\n\n\n== Get in ==\nShanghai is one of China's main travel hubs and arriving from pretty much anywhere is easy.\n\n\n=== Visa-free transit ===\nSee also: Visa requirements for China\nVisitors from 54 countries who are transiting through Shanghai are permitted to visit without a visa for up to 240 hours. People visiting under this scheme are can travel freely between Shanghai, Jiangsu and Zhejiang, but may not travel beyond the three provincial-level units. At immigration, you will need to present an onward ticket to a country other than the one you arrived from. Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan count as separate countries with regard to this scheme.\nThe following countries are included in the transit program:\n\n24 Schengen Agreement Countries: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland\n15 Other European Countries: Russia, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Cyprus, Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine, Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Albania, Belarus, Monaco\n6 American Countries: the United States, Canada, Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Chile\n2 Oceania Countries: Australia, New Zealand\n6 Asian Countries: Korea, Japan, Singapore, Brunei, United Arab Emirates, Qatar\n\n\n=== By plane ===\nShanghai has two main airports, with Pudong being the main international gateway, and Hongqiao being the main domestic airport, but also serving some international destinations in East Asia. Transfer between the airports takes about 40 min via the Airport Link Line, or about 1 hour by taxi. There are also direct shuttle buses.\nIf you're not in a hurry, you can also travel between the two airports in about two hours by metro. The airports are opposite ends of line  2 , the main East-West line through downtown Shanghai. You can reduce the time by taking the Maglev train (described in the next section) part of the way. A traveller making that transfer with a few hours to spare and a desire to get a quick look at Shanghai (and not too much luggage) might get off at Nanjing Road East and walk a few blocks to the Bund.\nFree tourist maps of central Shanghai, with major sights labeled in English, are available in little racks as you enter either airport. These are worth grabbing as you walk by since, except at some hotels, free maps are unavailable elsewhere.\nBoth airports also have direct bus service to major nearby cities such as Hangzhou, Suzhou and Nanjing, though the new fast trains may be preferable, especially from Hongqiao Airport which has Hongqiao Railway Station quite nearby (one metro stop or about a km on foot, indoors and level).\nDomestic airplane tickets are best booked in advance at one of the many travel agencies or online, but can also be bought at the airport on the day of departure. Fares are generally cheap, but vary depending on the season; figure on \u00a5400-1200 for Beijing-Shanghai. The low-cost airline Spring Airlines is based out of Shanghai with routes to most major Chinese tourist destinations, and frequently offers large discounts for tickets booked through its website. For budget travellers, it is often cheaper to book a flight on a heavy-traffic route (Shanghai-Beijing, Shanghai-Guangzhou, Shanghai-Shenzhen, etc.) and travel the rest by bus or train.\nThe city of Hangzhou, about a 45-min high-speed train ride from Shanghai, should also be considered if having a difficult time finding tickets to Pudong or Hongqiao. Also if coming in from South East Asia, since Air Asia has a cheap flight from Kuala Lumpur to Hangzhou. See Discount airlines in Asia.\n\n\n==== Pudong Airport ====\nMain article: Shanghai Pudong International Airport\n\n1 Pudong Airport (\u6d66\u4e1c\u673a\u573a, PVG IATA) (40 km to the southeast of the city). Shanghai's main international airport. PVG is the usual point of entry for flights arriving from overseas.   \nThe airport is on metro line  2 , many of the better hotels provide free airport shuttles for their guests, and there are six airport bus lines connecting to downtown. There are also buses to other cities nearby such as Suzhou and Hangzhou.\nIf you have heavy luggage then almost certainly a taxi will be more convenient; expect cost in the \u00a5200-500 range.\nThe most interesting way to arrive in Shanghai is on the former world's fastest train, the magnetic levitation train or Maglev. It was running 430 km/h till 2021; as of December, 2023, the maximum speed is capped at 300 km/h. Single tickets are \u00a560, discounted to \u00a550 if you have an airline ticket that day, or use Shanghai Public Transportation Card (detailed below). Return tickets (return within a week) are \u00a5100.\nThe Maglev terminates at Longyang Road station in Pudong which is still some distance from the city centre and may not therefore be close to your ultimate destination. Here you can connect to metro lines  2 ,  7  and the new line  16 ,  18 . Longyang Road station also has a Maglev train museum for those interested in how magnetic levitation trains work.\nBeginning in 2025 an Airport Link Line is put in service, connecting Pudong Airport to Hongqiao Airport Terminal 2 and Hongqiao Railway Station in 40 minutes. Notably, this new rail line passes well south of the city centre, making it of little use unless one intends to travel beyond Shanghai via high-speed rail or plane at Hongqiao.\n\n\n==== Hongqiao Airport ====\n2 Hongqiao Airport (\u8679\u6865\u673a\u573a SHA  IATA) (west of downtown in Changning (Terminal 1) and Minhang (Terminal 2) districts). Shanghai's older airport, much closer to the center than Pudong. It serves mainly domestic flights, the only exception being the city-shuttle services to Tokyo-Haneda, Seoul-Gimpo, Hong Kong, Macau and Taipei-Songshan. There are two terminals: the shiny, new and enormous T2, used by virtually all airlines, and the renovated but still comparatively small T1, used only by low-cost operator Spring Airlines and the international city shuttle services. You can transit between terminals on the airport shuttle bus, although waiting and travel time can take up to 45 minutes. For those in a hurry, taking metro line  10  between the two terminals may be worth the \u00a53 for the ticket.   \nT2 is served directly by metro line  2 , which connects the airport to People's Square and, further east, to Pudong Airport. Trains operate from 05:35 to 22:50 (service to and from Pudong Airport has limited hours). Line  10 , which also goes to central Shanghai but on a different route, serves both T1 and T2. \nLine  17  opened on 30 December 2017, and connects Hongqiao Railway Station (near the Airport) with Zhujiajiao.\nEventually Line  5 , the main line through the southern suburb Minhang, will be extended to the airport at the north end and into Fengxian to the south. Line  20  will extend north from the airport. As of early 2025 this is not in service.\nA taxi can manage the 12 km trip to the city in 20 minutes on a good day, but allow an extra 30 minutes for the taxi queue, especially when arriving after 19:00. Be sure to determine from which terminal your flight departs before you go to the airport as the English signage is confusing, taxi drivers will not be able to help you, and the shuttle between the terminals leaves on a half-hourly schedule with another twenty minute drive.\nDue to the metro line extension, the Hongqiao Airport Special Line bus (\u673a\u573a\u4e13\u7ebf) has now been replaced with a night bus (\u8679\u6865\u673a\u573aT2\u591c\u5bb5\u5df4\u58eb) that goes to Jing'an Temple, People's Square, and Lujiazui every 10-30 min from 22:30 (when the metro closes) to 45 minutes after the last inbound arrival of the day for \u00a510 (to Jing'an Temple or People's Square) or \u00a516 (to Lujiazui). It leaves from Door 1 of the Arrivals level of Terminal 2. Tickets are purchased inside the bus shortly before it departs.\nAlthough Hongqiao airport has fewer airport bus lines than Pudong, more public bus lines are linked to Hongqiao. Buses below run to T1, take the free shuttle to connect to T2 if needed or use Metro Line 10 if in a hurry.\n\nNo. 806: These buses run from Hongqiao airport to the Lupu Bridge between 06:00-21:30 at intervals of 5-15 min. The line also has a stop at Xujiahui, and the whole trip costs \u00a55.\nNo. 807: These buses operate between 06:00-22:30 from Hongqiao airport to the Zhenguang New Village in Putuo District, stopping at the Shanghai Zoo and some other places of interest. \u00a52.\nNo. 1207: This bus only runs between the airport and Shanghai Zoo. \u00a52.\nWith the opening of Metro service to the airport, only the above two routes serve the airport.\nOne public bus line has now been moved to T2. The reverse applies- take the free shuttle or the Metro to T1 if needed. Bus service to T2 splits boarding and exiting- all passengers arriving at T2 get off at the Departures level of the airport, but those wishing to board must board the bus at the bus hub on 1/F of the airport/metro station complex.\n\nNo. 941: Linking Hongqiao airport and Shanghai Railway Station, the line runs from 06:30\u201322:30 to the airport/23:00 from the airport. \u00a54. Interval between services is 10-12 min. Look for Waiting Room 1.\nAdditionally, the following night bus runs from T2 between the hours of 23:00 and 05:00 for anyone arriving late at night and needing to stop at destinations not covered by the T1 night bus:\n\nNo. 316: Links the airport to the Bund, following Metro Line 2 until Zhongshan Park, then makes stops near Changshou Road (Line 7), Xinzha Road (Line 1), and East Nanjing Road (Line 2/10) before terminating at the Bund.\nAn additional night bus from the train station side is also available.\n\nNo. 320: Links the train station to the Bund via a different route. This bus stops near the tourist part of Hongmei Road, then follows Metro Line 10 until Jiaotong University, stops in Xujiahui, continues along Line 10, then starts following line 1 around the Changshu Road stop until it reaches the Xintiandi area, then makes one final stop in Yu Gardens before terminating at the Bund.\n\n\n=== By train ===\nShanghai has a few major train stations including:\n\n1 Shanghai Railway Station  1  3  4  (\u4e0a\u6d77\u7ad9), 100 Moling Road (three stops north from People's square on line  1 ). Shanghai's oldest, located in Zhabei District. Practically all trains used to terminate here, but many southbound services have been shifted to the South Station and most high-speed services use Hongqiao Station.   (updated Mar 2018)\n2 Hongqiao Railway Station  2  10  17  (\u4e0a\u6d77\u8679\u6865\u7ad9). A huge new station located in the same building complex as Hongqiao Airport Terminal 2. The connecting metro stop shares the same name, Hongqiao Railway Station, and is one stop beyond the Hongqiao airport stop. Most high-speed trains uses this station.   (updated Aug 2018)\n3 Shanghai South Railway Station  1  3  15  (\u4e0a\u6d77\u5357\u7ad9). in Xuhui District. Started southern-bound high-speed services while having kept direct 'Z' trains since start of 2025, which is the fastest among classic speed trains. Slow overnight trains were move to Songjiang.   (updated Jan 2025)\n4 Shanghai West Railway Station  11  15  (\u4e0a\u6d77\u897f\u7ad9/\u5357\u7fd4\u5317\u7ad9/\u5b89\u4ead\u5317\u7ad9). Some high-speed trains to Nanjing direction stop at this small station. In addition, there are a few trains to and from Shanghai Station for connections to other trains.   (updated Feb 2022)\n Shanghai Songjiang Railway Station  9  (\u677e\u6c5f\u7ad9). Absorbed most of classic-speed trains from Shanghai South except for Direct 'Z' trains.  (updated Jan 2025)\nShanghai East Railway Station is under construction as of May 2024 and will serve Pudong Airport.\nSelf-serve automated ticket booths are prevalent and can be used for checking train times in the English mode, but you can only buy tickets from them if you have a Chinese ID card. Tickets are also conveniently booked in advance at one of the many travel service agencies, or the ticket office of any railway station. See the train tickets section of the China article. Note that Hong Kong tickets go on sale 60 days in advance, and the Hong Kong\u2013Shanghai segment sells out quickly.\n\nBeijing (\u5317\u4eac) \u2014 Beginning in June 2011, an all-new express line service from Beijing started, with the quickest travel time option ringing in at 4 hours and 18 minutes (G17/G22). Additionally, there are a number of fast night sleeper trains running daily. These trains have D-prefix codes, take just over 10 hours from Shanghai to Beijing. Fare is around \u00a5730 for a soft sleeper lower berth or \u00a5655 for upper berth; the trains are clean and the four-person cabins are comfortable. Two-person rooms are also available on some of these trains, the price is about \u00a51470 for a lower berth or \u00a51300 for an upper. Two-person rooms on D trains do not have private baths. In the same new train, normal second-class seats are available for around \u00a5327. For a regular normal sleeper in a standard train, which takes 13 hours from Shanghai to Beijing, expect to pay \u00a5306 to \u00a5327 for a hard sleeper or around \u00a5478 to \u00a5499 for a soft one. Two-person sleepers are available on T-series trains, with private bath and a sofa, price is \u00a5881 for upper berth or \u00a5921 for a lower. But tickets for these cheaper normal sleepers are usually very tight.\nHong Kong (\u9999\u6e2f) \u2014 The high-speed G99/G100 day trains run daily between West Kowloon Station in Hong Kong and Shanghai Hongqiao station, taking about 8 hours to complete the journey. Tickets cost about \u00a51008 one way in economy class. Overnight high-speed sleeper services, numbered G899/G900 run on the same route 4 times a week and take about 11 hours. Both mainland Chinese and Hong Kong immigration procedures are conducted at the station in Hong Kong. The old conventional sleeper trains from Hung Hom station have been terminated.\nLhasa (\u62c9\u8428) \u2014 The train to and from Lhasa, Tibet runs every day from Shanghai Railway Station. It takes just under 50 hours to arrive at Lhasa. A hard seat costs \u00a5406 and a hard sleeper priced around \u00a5900, soft sleeper costs around \u00a51300. Oxygen is available for each passenger in the Golmud\u2013Lhasa section. A Tibet travel permit is required for non-Chinese citizens.\nThe new fast (200+ km/h) CRH trains from Shanghai go southwest to Nanchang and Changsha, or north to Beijing, Zhengzhou and Qingdao. These are very comfortable and convenient. Train route codes begin with D in this instance. High-speed trains (300+ km/h) to Nanjing and Hangzhou have a G prefix.\n\n\n=== By car ===\nGood modern highways link Shanghai to nearby cities in East China, including Nanjing, Suzhou, Hangzhou and Ningbo. Other highways, many of them as good, go to more distant cities anywhere in the country. It only takes about an hour to reach Shanghai from Suzhou, 2 hours from Hangzhou or 2\u00bd hours from Ningbo, the latter via the 36 km long Hangzhou Bay Bridge, the world's longest sea-crossing bridge.\n\n\n=== By bus ===\nThere are several long-distance bus stations in Shanghai. You should try to get the tickets as early as possible.\n\n Beiqu Long-distance Passenger Station, 80 Gongxing Lu. \n Hengfeng Road Express Passenger Station (\u6052\u4e30\u8def\u5ba2\u8fd0\u7ad9), 270 Hengfeng Lu. This is one of the largest and is just north of the main railway station. It serves most destinations in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and some more distant cities such as Beijing and Guangzhou. It's well organized but can be a little hard to find \u2014 particularly with the major rebuilding of the North Station Square. From Shanghai Railway Station (North) metro station (Lines 3 & 4) take exit No. 1. You'll come out in the middle of a construction site. Head left and keep walking straight and eventually (after an unpleasant 10-minute walk) you'll find it. Motorcycle-taxis will loiter around the station exit and will take you there for around \u00a55 if you bargain hard \u2014 however they can be pushy and aggressive. \n Zhongshan Beilu Long-distance Passenger Transport Station, 1015 Zhongshan Bei Lu. \n Xujiahui Passenger Station, 211 Hongqiao Lu. \n Pudong Tangqiao Long-distance Passenger Station, 3842 Pudong Nan Lu. \n\n\n=== By boat ===\nThere are ferry services from Kobe and Osaka (Japan) weekly.\n\n  MV Xinjianzhen, \u260f +86-021-63257642, +81-06-6536-6541, cmeiying@chinjif.com. Departure alternates each week with Kobe or Osaka, and arrives at Shanghai. The schedule can be found here.  (updated Feb 2020)\n\n\n== Get around ==\nShanghai has an excellent public transport network with the one of the world's most extensive metro (subway and elevated train) systems as its backbone and buses that go more-or-less everywhere else. Taxis are plentiful, and cheap by international standards, and getting around on foot is often practical. Metro, taxi and walking will be the main means of transport for most travellers. The city is huge (24 million), though, and all transport methods sometimes have problems with congestion.\n\n\n=== Metro cards ===\n\n\n==== Shanghai Jiaotong Card ====\nIf you intend to stay in Shanghai for more than a few days, a metro card \u2014 also called a Shanghai Jiaotong Card (\u4e0a\u6d77\u516c\u5171\u4ea4\u901a\u5361) or Shanghai Public Transportation Card \u2014 is a must. You can get these cards at any metro station, as well as some convenience stores like Alldays and KeDi Marts.\nYou can load the card with money and use it in buses, the metro and even taxis, saving the hassle of buying tickets (sometimes with long queues) and keeping change for buses and taxis. Also, the card allows you to change lines at some stations where without the card you would need to get another ticket, and gives a \u00a51 discount for each bus\u2194bus or metro\u2194bus transfer.\nThese cards do not require contact with the card reader to work. It is quite common to see someone just pass a purse, wallet or shoulder bag over the reader without taking the card out, and this almost always works. The card can be used once after it runs out of money; up to a \u00a58 \"overdraft\" is allowed.\nCards come in several sizes \u2014 regular (credit card size), mini, and \"strap\" (for hanging on mobile phones) \u2014 and special editions with interesting pictures are available for each. New machines that can load money to any size of card are replacing older machines, but they do not take cash, generally only accepting Alipay or UnionPay/Discover cards. Service counters in most metro stations will recharge any type of card in multiples of \u00a510, but a few stations are no longer staffing their service counters, while others are experimenting with requiring recharges to be done at the self-service machines, so it is advised to make sure sufficient funds are available for your return trip if you are going to a less-populated part of town.\nThere is a \u00a520 deposit for the card; regular-sized cards can be returned for a deposit refund, but mini or strap sizes cannot. For any card type, the balance on the card can be immediately returned if it is less than \u00a510. If the balance is between \u00a510 and \u00a52,000, an invoice should be taken to ask for the return of money; however, a 5% handling fee will be charged. Some metro stations have special offices for returning the cards. These stations include:\n\nLine 1 - Hanzhong Rd, Hengshan Rd, Jinjiang Park;\nLine 2 - Jiangsu Rd, E Nanjing Rd, Century Park, Songhong Rd;\nLine 3 - Dongbaoxing Rd, Zhenping Rd, Caoxi Rd, North Jiangyang Rd;\nLine 4 - Yangshupu Rd.\nYou can also use the Shanghai Public Transportation Card Service Center, No 609, Jiujiang Rd, M-F 09:30\u201318:30, Sa Su 09:30\u201316:30.\nShanghai Public Transportation Card may also be had in Apple Pay.\n\n\n==== China T-union ====\nAs of 2024, you can now use your China T-union card. China T-union covers all bus, metro and ferry lines in Shanghai, as well as taxis. Like the Jiaotong Card, you save the hassle of buying tickets (sometimes with long queues) and keeping change for buses and taxis. Also, the card allows you to change lines at some stations where without the card you would need to get another ticket, and gives a discount for each bus\u2194bus or metro\u2194bus transfer. However, non-local cards are no eligible for discounts (10% off) after you accumulated expenses of 70 yuan in a calendar month. \nChina T-union tickets are not valid on high-speed rail lines, the Shanghai Maglev, regional trains, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.\n\n\n=== By metro ===\nShanghai Metro is one of the largest and busiest metro systems in the world. As of mid-2024, there are over 800 km (500 miles) of line and over 500 stations. Usage is over 10 million rides on a typical weekday.\n\nIn general the network is great \u2014 clean, fast, cheap (\u00a53-10 depending on distance), air-conditioned, and fairly user-friendly with signs and station arrival announcements in both Mandarin and English, while announcements on Lines 16 and 17 are trilingual in Shanghainese, Mandarin and English. However, station counter staff rarely speak English, though they may still try to help you by using translation apps on their phones.\nThe drawbacks are that trains are packed during rush hour, trains do not run late at night (the last train is usually around 22:30, with some lines going until around midnight on Friday and Saturday nights), and the network does not go everywhere yet, though it is continually being expanded.\n\n\n==== Metro lines ====\n\nEach metro line has a particular colour on all maps and signs, and often in station decor. As of mid-2024 lines  1 ,  2 ,  3 ,  4 ,  5 ,  6 ,  7 ,  8 ,  9 ,  10 ,  11 ,  12 ,  13 ,  14 ,  15 ,  16 ,  17 ,  18 ,  Pujiang  and  Jinshan  are in service.\nThree of the most important lines are line  1  north-south, line  2  east-west, and line  4  which encircles all of the city centre.\nIn central areas most lines (but not lines  3  and  4 ) run underground. Out in the suburbs, most are above ground and many on elevated tracks.\nMany metro lines ( 1 ,  2 ,  3 ,  4 ,  7 ,  8 ,  9 ,  10 ,  11 ,  12 ,  13 ) run through downtown.\n\n3 Line 1. The main north-south line through downtown. Parts of it run through the French Concession, under Huaihai Road and Hengshan Road, then north to People's Park and Shanghai Railway station. Beyond there it goes north to Baoshan and an extension to Chongming Island is in the planning stage, as of 2018. Its south end goes into Minhang and connects to Line  5  for journeys further south.   \n Line 2. The most important east-west line of the city. Downtown it runs under Nanjing Road. Its western end goes to Hongqiao Airport and beyond. To the east, it runs through downtown Pudong and terminates at Pudong Airport.   \nLines  1  and  2  meet at People's Square in Huangpu District, and Line  8  also goes there. This is one of the busiest metro stations on Earth and is often considered the center of Shanghai.\n Line 3. Runs in an arc around the west side of downtown, next to Line 4 for much of the route. In the south it ends at Shanghai South Railway Station; in the north it goes to Shanghai Railway Station and beyond, through Hongkou and into Baoshan.   \n Line 4. Runs on a circular route around central Shanghai, mostly on the Puxi side, but it also goes into Pudong. For approximately the western third of the route it runs next to Line 3.   \n Line 7. Runs from Jiading in the north, goes to Jing'An Temple and through the French Concession, then east into Pudong.   \n Line 8. Runs from Yangpu in the north through part of Hongkou, to People's Square Station in Huangpu, east into Pudong, and finally into the part of Minhang that lies east of the river.   \n Line 9. Comes from Pudong across southern parts of downtown, to Xujiahui, then west out to Songjiang.   \n Line 10. From Hongqiao Railway Station in the west, through the French Concession, to Yuyuan Gardens in the Old City, intersecting Line 2 at Nanjing Road East in Huangpu, to the huge Qipu Road clothing market, and north into Hongkou and Yangpu.   \n Line 11. Starts at the Disney resort in Nanhui on the Pudong side, crosses the river and crosses southern parts of the French Concession to Xujiahui, then swings north into Changning, Putuo and Jiading. At or north of Xujiahui, it intersects most of the major lines downtown. It continues northwest out of Shanghai Municipality; reaching Kunshan, where it connects to the Suzhou metro.   \n Line 12. Starts in Minhang south of downtown, runs through the French Concession and Jing'an with stops including South Shaanxi Road Station on Huaihai Road and West Nanjing Road, through Hongkou and Yangpu, and across the river to the northern part of Pudong.   \n Line 13. Starts in Jiading, crosses Putuo, makes several stops downtown including West Nanjing Road and Xintiandi, then crosses the river into southern Pudong, ending at Zhanjiang Road.   \n Line 14. Starts in Pudong, crosses from east to west through downtown, makes several stops downtown including Yuyuan Gardens and Jing'an Temple.   \n Jinshan Railway. A commuter railway operated by China Railway (instead of Shanghai Metro). Service starts from Shanghai South Railway Station, the commuter service makes several stops in Minhang, Songjiang, Jinshan, and terminates at Jinshanwei Station. The line utilizes high-speed train sets, and all stations sell long-distance train tickets.   \nLines that do not come downtown are line  5  which serves the southern suburb Minhang, line  17  which runs from Hongqiao Railway Station to the western suburb Qingpu, and lines  6 ,  16  and  Pujiang  whose routes are across the river in Pudong New Area.\n\n\n==== Metro stations ====\nImportant metro stations include:\n\n4 People's Square (People's Park). Interchange for lines  1 ,  2  and  8 . One of the world's busiest metro stops at around 700,000 passengers a day. Has a large shopping area attached, mostly clothing and tourist goods.   \n5 Shanghai Railway Station. Lines  1 ,  3  and  4 . There are actually two metro stops here, one for Line 1 and another for Lines 3 and 4, and it is a long walk between them.   \n6 Zhongshan Park. Lines  2 ,  3  and  4 . Has the huge Cloud Nine mall attached. The park that the station is named after is nearby.   \n7 Xujiahui. A major interchange with Lines  1 ,  9  and  11 . There are several huge malls nearby; see French Concession for details.   \n\n\n==== How to use ====\nThe most convenient way to pay is with a metro card; see previous section. There are also one-day cards available which can be purchased for \u00a518, good for 24 hours after their first use. Single-use tickets can be bought at automatic ticket-vending machines using cash, WeChat Pay or AliPay. They have instructions in English and can give change. Most stations on lines  1 ,  2 ,  3  will also have staff selling single-use ticket cards, but on the newly-completed lines  6 ,  8 , and  9  ticket-purchasing is all done by machine, with staff there only to assist in adding credit to cards or if something goes wrong. With the single-use cards, you select your destination and pay by distance, then swipe before boarding and insert the ticket into a machine when you exit. If you live in China, you can also use WeChat Pay or Alipay. Metro faregates are equipped with QR code scanners that can scan a QR code generated by the WeChat or Alipay app on your smartphone.\nIf there are seats available, then be prepared for a literal mad dash as passengers shove and wrestle for the available seats. You can try and do the same, but bear in mind that everyone else will have a lot more experience than you! Also, be mindful of pickpockets who may use this rush to their advantage.\nTransfers between lines can involve a very long walk in some stations. In most places you can transfer between lines freely with a single ticket. But there are exceptions, where two or more lines have stations with the same name, but the stations are separate so you need a second ticket for the second train (unless you have a metro card).\nThe separate stations with the same name are:\n\nShanghai Railway Station - lines  3 / 4  and line  1  are separate stations\nWest Nanjing Road Station - lines  2 ,  12  and  13  are in separate stations a few minutes apart from each other.\nPudian Road (Pudian Lu) - lines  4  and  6 ; these stops are on the same street but are not close to each other. Use the free transfer one stop in either direction (Century Ave or Lancun Road) instead.\nMost stations include some retail facilities; in many, these are limited to a few snack vendors, but some (e.g. Xujiahui and People's Park) have substantial food courts and shopping areas right in the station. From many stations \u2014 including Xujiahui, South Shaanxi Road, Nanjing Road East and Zhongshan Park \u2014 you can walk directly into large department stores or malls without going outdoors. For stations with souvenirs and cheap clothing, see #Clothing below.\n\n\n=== By bus ===\n\nThe bus system is cheaper and much more extensive than the metro, and some routes operate after the closing time of the metro (route numbers beginning with 3 are the night buses that run past 23:00). It is however slower in general, and all route information at bus stops is in Chinese, but here is a handy list of bus routes and stops in English. Once inside the bus, there are English announcements.\nSome rural bus services in Shanghai are not numbered, and are instead referred as XX line (XX\u7ebf), in which XX are the initial of the origin and destination. Rural bus services referred as XX special line (XX\u4e13\u7ebf) are usually faster services. Other special bus services are numbered with a descriptive Chinese word, or a description of the origin and destination and a Chinese number, such as \"Bridge line 1\" (\u5927\u6865\u4e00\u8def), \"Tunnel line 2\" (\u96a7\u9053\u4e8c\u8def), or \"Shanghai-Chongming line 3\" (\u7533\u5d07\u4e09\u8def).\nSome buses have a conductor; get on, sit down and he or (more often) she will come around; pay him or her and you'll get a paper ticket and change, if any. Fares depend on distance and conductors rarely speak any English, so you must either know your destination and be able to pronounce it in Chinese, or have it written down in Chinese characters.\nOther buses do not have a conductor, only the driver; there is a fixed price for the route, usually \u00a52 if the buses are air-conditioned and \u00a51.5 on increasingly rare routes running on old buses without. Check the bus itself as on some routes the fare varies from bus to bus; typically there is a sign showing the fare on the outside next to the door and/or on the fare box. Exact fare is required unless you have a Public Transportation Card; prepare exact change beforehand and drop it into the box next to the driver.\nIf you change buses with a Public Transportation Card, you get a \u00a51 discount on your second bus fare and all subsequent transfers. There is a 90-minute window to do this. So if you're not spending too much time at the destination, the discount will apply to the start of your return journey, too.\nSeveral companies offer sightseeing buses with various routes and packages covering the main sights such as the Shanghai Zoo, Oriental Pearl Tower, and Baoyang Road Harbor. Many of these leave from the Shanghai Stadium's east bus station. You can also pick one up downtown on Nanjing Road near the park between People's Park and Nanjing Road West metro stops or at the Shanghai History Museum. The buses usually have an audio guide in the world's major languages. The company that has the lowest tariff offers a one-day ticket for \u00a560, covering the main attractions in downtown Shanghai and Lujiazui (AKA Central Pudong).\n\n\n=== By taxi ===\n\nTaxi (\"\u51fa\u79df\u8f66\" ch\u016bz\u016bch\u0113 or choo-tzoo-chuh) is a good choice for transportation in the city, especially during off-peak hours. It is affordable \u2014 \u00a514 (or \u00a516 for larger vehicles) for the first 3 km during the day, \u00a518 after 23:00, \u00a52.4/km up to 10 km, and \u00a53.5/km after; when wheels aren't rolling, time is also tracked and billed but the first 5 min. are free; a \u00a51 fuel surcharge is also applied. Going from the centre out to Pudong Airport costs around \u00a5200.\n\nTaxi drivers typically do not speak any English, so unless you speak Mandarin, be sure to have your destination written in Chinese characters to show the driver. Get a business card for your hotel or any restaurant or shop you like; that makes it easy to return there. As Shanghai is a huge city, try to get the nearest intersection to your destination as well, since even addresses in Chinese are often useless. If you have a mobile phone, you can also use the phone number displayed in the back of the taxi. Dial the number and tell the agent in English where you want to go. Hand the phone to the driver and the agent will tell him in Chinese where you wish to go. The agent will even find out the addresses of bars and other spots for you if required.\nTry to avoid using \u00a5100 notes to pay for short journeys; either use a metro card or have change available; taxi drivers are not keen on giving away their change. Also, the \u00a550 note is a favourite of counterfeiters and a foreigner unfamiliar with the money is an obvious person to foist a bad one on, so you should try to avoid getting a fifty in your change. Additionally, one trick used by unscrupulous drivers is to claim you passed them a bad \u00a5100, when you in fact gave them a good \u00a5100 and they swapped it for a bad one. To avoid hassles of change, virtually all drivers accept WeChat and AliPay.\nTaxis are very hard to come by during peak hours and when it's raining, so be prepared to wait for a while or walk to a busy pick-up location. Foreign visitors might be surprised at the almost compete lack of courtesy or lines while waiting for a taxi, so don't be afraid to \"jump in\" and get one \u2014 it's first come, first served.  There are some taxi stops where attendants maintain a well-ordered line; this may be the fastest way to get a taxi in a busy part of town, but there are few of them, so expect a long walk to find one.\nDrivers, while generally honest, are sometimes genuinely clueless and occasionally out to take you for a ride. The drivers are very good about using the meter but in case they forget, remind them. It's also the law to provide a receipt for the rider, so if your fare seems out of line, be sure to obtain one as it's necessary to receive any compensation. If you feel you have been cheated or mistreated by the driver, you (or a Chinese-speaking friend) can use the information on the printed receipt to raise a complaint to the taxi company about that particular driver. The driver will be required to pay 3x the fare if ordered by the taxi company, so normally they're very good about taking the appropriate route. The printed receipt is also useful to contact the driver in case you have forgotten something in the taxi and need to get it back.\nIf you come across a row of parked taxis and have a choice of which one to get in to, you may wish to check the driver's taxi ID card, posted near the meter on the dashboard. The higher the number, the newer the driver, so there may be more chance that the driver will not know where he or she is going. Those with numbers between 10XXXX and 12XXXX are the most experienced drivers; a number above 27XXXX indicates a new driver who may get you lost somewhere. Another way is to check the number of stars the driver has; these are displayed below the driver's photograph on the dashboard. The number of stars indicates the length of time the driver has been in the taxi business and the level of positive feedback received from customers, and range from zero stars to five. Drivers with one star or more should know all major locations in Shanghai, and those with three stars should be able to recognize even lesser-known addresses. Remember that it takes time to build up these stars, and so don't panic if you find yourself with a driver who doesn't have any \u2014 just have them assure you that they know where they are going and you should be fine.\nIf you need to cross from one side of the Huangpu River to the other by taxi, especially from Pudong to Puxi, you may want to make sure your driver will make the trip, and knows where he or she is going; some drivers only know their side of the town and may become lost once they cross the river. Taxis are notoriously difficult to get on rainy days and during peak traffic hours, so plan your journeys accordingly. As the crossings between Pudong and Puxi are often jammed with traffic, taking a taxi may be more expensive and slower than the metro. It may be better to take the metro across the river and then catch a taxi.\nTaxi colors in Shanghai are strictly controlled and indicate the company the taxi belongs to. Turquoise taxis operated by Dazhong (\u5927\u4f17), the largest group, are often judged the best of the bunch. Other good companies include Qiangsheng (\u5f3a\u751f), uses gold-colored taxis and Jinjiang (\u9526\u6c5f), which uses white taxis. Watch out for dark red/maroon taxis, since this is the 'default' color of small taxi companies and includes more than its fair share of bad apples. There are also privately owned taxis (easily recognized as they have an 'X' in their number plate and may not be the standard Volkswagen Santana used by most taxi companies). The dark red/maroon taxis will also go \"off the meter\" at times and charge rates 4x-5x the normal rate \u2014 especially around the tourist areas of the Yuyuan Gardens. Bright red taxis and blue taxis, on the other hand, are unionized and quite OK, furthermore there are more 3-star and above taxi drivers working for these companies. The bright orange taxis cover suburban areas only and are not allowed within the \"city\" area, but their meters start at \u00a511 and count at \u00a52.4/km no matter how long the journey, so they're somewhat cheaper if you're not trying to get downtown (rule of thumb \u2014 if you're trying to go somewhere within the Outer Ring highway, don't get one, but if your journey ends just within it you may be able to find a driver willing to bend the rules).\nUsing the Smart Shanghai app (about \u00a32.00 from App Store) or the Smart Shanghai website will help you take taxis. Find the sight, restaurant, hotel or bar you are looking for on the app or website and click on the 'Taxi Directions' button for the address written in Chinese. Just show this to the driver and you'll be on your way!\n\n\n=== On foot ===\nShanghai is a good city for walking, especially in the older parts of the city such as the Bund, but be aware this city is incredibly dynamic and pavements can be obstructed or unpleasant to walk through when near construction areas. If there is a metro entry at a busy street, the station can usually be used as a pedestrian underpass to another metro exit across the way.\nSome distances in Shanghai are huge, so you will need to use other means of transportation at some point. However, quite a few people navigate well with just a metro pass plus their feet and perhaps the occasional taxi.\nSee #Do below for some suggested walks that combine shopping and sightseeing.\nThe Bund \"sightseeing tunnel\" is very strange, and doesn't actually show you any sites of the city at all. It is an unusual (albeit pricey) way to get across the river however. See Shanghai/Huangpu#Do for details.\nAs with all of China, right-of-way is effectively proportional to weight: vehicles trump motorbikes, which trump pedestrians. Motorbikes and bicycles rarely use headlights and can come from any direction. They are the main users of curb-cuts for sidewalks, so don't stand at these. Avoid unpredictable movements while walking and crossing streets: the drivers see you and predict your future location from your speed. See Driving in China for further discussion.\n\n\n=== By ferry ===\nA useful ferry runs between the Bund (from a ferry pier a few blocks south of Nanjing Road next to the KFC restaurant) and Lujiazui financial district in Pudong (the terminal is about 10 minutes south of the Pearl TV Tower and Lujiazui metro station) and is the cheapest way of crossing the river at \u00a52 per person. Cyclists pay 2.8 and motorcyclists pay 4 yuan. Buy a token from the ticket kiosk and then insert it into the turnstile to enter the waiting room \u2014 the boats run every 10 minutes and take just over 5 minutes to cross the river. This is a great (and much cheaper) alternative to using the Bund Sightseeing Tunnel. However, some of the ferry stations are not directly connected to public transport so you need to walk a bit.\n\n\n=== By bicycle ===\n\nSee also: Cycling in China\nFor locals, bicycles are slowly being eclipsed by electric scooters. But they still remain an easy means of transportation for visitors who may be hesitant to communicate with drivers or board crowded mass transit \u2014 or simply want to soak up some sunshine. Beware of the driving habits of locals: the biggest vehicles have the priority and a red light does not mean you are safe to cross the street. Bicycles and mopeds are not allowed on many major roads (signs designate this), or in the tunnels and on the bridges between Pudong and Puxi (the only way to cross is by ferry).\nSome hostels have bikes for rent and many department stores sell them, starting around \u00a5200. Alternatively, go to Baoshan Metro station and get a vintage bicycle for about \u00a5300. Bikes for sale are also easily found on the street around Suzhou Creek or in the residential part of the old town.\nThere is a city-operated system of free bicycles, but the stands are card-operated and as of 2012 the cards were available only to registered Shanghai residents; even migrant workers from other parts of China were excluded. There are many stands around town, each with a few dozen bikes; with a card, you can take one. If you return it to any stand within four hours, there is no charge.\nHowever, since around 2017, commercially-run dockless rideshare bikes have surged in popularity and are now basically ubiquitous. Many locals, especially the younger generation, no longer own bikes and instead prefer these shared bikes due to their \"start anywhere, park anywhere, leave and forget\" nature. As of 2020, two major operators have a quintessential duopoly on the market: the yellow bikes backed by Meituan, and the blue bikes backed by Alipay. Both require a phone app to use. The initial setup could be a little tedious - you have to download the app, register, and most likely pay a deposit around \u00a5200, but afterwards it's a simple scan of a QR code and the bike will unlock. Dockless rideshare bikes combine particularly well with Shanghai's extensive metro system. You can often find many bikes at the metro station, and just take one to cover the last kilometre to your final destination. Therefore it is highly recommended for anyone who intends to stay longer than a few weeks. Each ride will cost you \u00a51-2 which is certainly not a lot, and you can even purchase a weekly or monthly pass for very cheap and enjoy unlimited rides.\n\n\n=== By car ===\nSee also: Driving in China\nDriving is definitely not recommended in Shanghai for a variety of reasons, even for those with driving experience in the country. Drivers have to cope not only with a very complex road system and seemingly perpetual traffic jams, but also with Chinese driving habits and ongoing construction. In addition, parking spaces are rare and almost impossible to find. Bicycles, scooters and pedestrians are also all over the place \u2014 it is not unheard of for cyclists, motorcyclists or pedestrians to suddenly dash in front of a car without any warning. In short, do not drive if you can help it and make use of Shanghai's excellent public transportation network instead.\n\n\n=== By motorcycle and scooter ===\nWhile motorcycle rental is practically non-existent, for long-term visitors e-bikes and scooters are a cheap, fast, practical way of getting around. E-bikes don't require a driving license and are cheaper, but only have a short battery range (about 50 km) and a low top speed, and are a frequent target of thieves. A cheap e-bike can be picked up from any major supermarket \u2014 expect to pay around \u00a51500-2500 for a new model. Small shops also sell converted e-bikes (motor scooters converted to run on electricity) which are more expensive but are faster, more comfortable and have longer battery ranges. 50cc motorcycles require registration but don't require a drivers license, whilst anything bigger will require a driving license. Motorcycles can be bought from used-bike dealers mostly located in residential working-class neighbourhoods \u2014 a used 50cc moped will be about \u00a52000 whilst a 125cc will cost much more depending on condition and mileage. If you plan to ride a motorcycle, stick to automatic transmission scooters as they are much easier to ride in dense traffic than a manually-geared bike.\nFor motorcycles above 50cc, a special yellow license plate and drivers license is required, both of which is independent from a car's licenses. These motorcycles are subject to the same laws that apply to cars and ride in car lanes, but with additional restrictions. All elevated roads, tunnels, and bridges crossing Huangpu River ban motorcycles with the exception of Nanpu Bridge, Xupu bridge, and Fuxing Road Tunnel. Motorcycles can also use ferries.\nMotorcycles below 50cc are expected to use the bicycle lane and cross intersections via pedestrian traffic lights, which is often quicker when car traffic reaches a standstill. Be careful, particularly at night, of people riding with their headlights off or riding on the wrong side of the road \u2014 remember that e-bikes don't require any driving license and therefore drivers often flout traffic laws and take creative but dangerous paths through traffic. Parking is easy \u2014 most sidewalks serve as bike-parking, although in quiet streets your bike may be stolen, so use a couple of good locks. At busy places, attended bike parks charge around \u00a50.5-1 per day.\nVintage motorbikes with sidecars are used by mainly by expats and tourists. Most expatriates and Shanghainese are too embarrassed to use what many consider a particularly \"uncool\" form of transport.\nChangjiang sidecars were used by the Chinese army until 1997. There are a few sidecar owners clubs in Shanghai (Black Bats, People's Riders Club), shops (Yiqi, Cao, Fan, Jack, Jonson, Leo) and a tour operator (Shanghai Sideways) which are worth checking out. See also Driving in China \u2014 Sidecar rigs.\n\n\n== See ==\nIndividual listings can be found in Shanghai's district articles\nWhere to go in Shanghai depends largely on available time and your interests. For the areas with most of the main tourist attractions, see the Downtown and Pudong sections above and the district articles they link to. You can also download some apps like Meituan, or use the local search engine Baidu to find more information; if prices and locations have changed recently, the apps are more likely to be up-to-date than many online listings.\nMany of Shanghai's main tourist sights are in Huangpu District:\n\nThe Old City (\u8001\u57ce\u53a2; Lao Chengxiang, also known as \u5357\u5e02, Nanshi) is the original Chinese city going back about 1000 years, now a major tourist area. The center of that area is Yuyuan Gardens.\nThe International Settlement was built North and West of the Old City, starting in the 1840s. In colonial-period Western books, \"Shanghai\" means that settlement.\n The Bund (\u5916\u6ee9 W\u00e0it\u0101n). The riverside avenue that was the center of 19th century Shanghai and is now a major tourist attraction. \n People's Square (Renmin Gongyuan). What was once the horse-racing track on the edge of the British district is now a large and busy downtown park. The old track's clubhouse now houses a museum and a fine restaurant. Under the square at the edge of the park is a metro station that is one of the hubs of the Shanghai system and one of the busiest subway stations on Earth; lines  1 ,  2  and  8  meet there. Nearby are several large high-end malls and department stores. \n\nNanjing Road was the main street of the old British Concession; today it is a major upmarket shopping street. Line  2  runs under it for some distance and has four stations along it; listed east-west they are Nanjing Road East, People's Square, Nanjing Road West and jing'an Temple. The road extends across two districts.\n\nNanjing Road East in Huangpu District extends from the Bund to People's Park, and most of it is a very busy pedestrians-only strip.\nNanjing Road West is the continuation into Jing'an District. Part of it runs along the north side of People's Park. A landmark beyond the park is Jing'an Temple, a beautiful ancient building with a metro station named after it.\nFor a taste of 1920s Shanghai, with much classic Western-style architecture, head for the stately old buildings of the Bund and nearby parts of Huangpu; this is still a major shopping area as well. If your taste runs more to very modern architecture, remarkably tall buildings and enormous shopping malls, the prime districts for skyscrapers are Pudong and Jing'an. See the linked articles for details.\nOther major sights are in the former French Concession. This has always been a fashionable area\u2014even in the colonial period, many famous Chinese lived there\u2014and it remains so today with much of Shanghai's best entertainment and shopping. We treat it as a single district and give it its own article. Within it are:\n\nXujiahui, the center of Xuhui District, with a metro interchange (lines  1 ,  9  and  11 ), major roads, huge malls including many electronics stores, and high-end residential and office buildings.\nHuaihai Road, an upmarket shopping street which many Shanghai people prefer over Nanjing Road.\nHengshan Road, which runs from Huaihai Road to Xujiahui, has Shanghai's largest cluster of restaurants and bars.\nXintiandi, an area of old shikumen (\"stone gate\", a unique Shanghai style) houses, redeveloped with shopping malls, trendy bars and restaurants, and a lot of tourism.\nTianzifang, another area of shikumen housing that has been redeveloped. It is newer than Xintiandi and emphasizes arts, crafts and boutique shopping where Xintiandi stresses brand-name goods and entertainment.\nOverall, the French Concession is Shanghai's best area for boutique shopping, small galleries and craft shops, and interesting restaurants.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nHuangpu has the Shanghai Museum and the Shanghai Urban Planning Museum, on opposite sides of People's Square, and the Bund Historical Museum, in a park at the north end of the Bund.\nThe Shanghai Railway Museum is near Shanghai Railway Station in Zhabei.\nThe Chinese Martial Arts Museum is on the campus of Shanghai Institute of Physical Education; see the Yangpu District article for details.\nThere is a Yuan-Dynasty Water Sluice Museum in Putuo District, an interesting example of medieval engineering.\nThe Shanghai Municipal History Museum is across the river, below the Pearl Tower in Pudong. Pudong is also home to the China Art Museum, housed in what was the China Pavilion of the 2010 World Expo, and dedicated to modern Chinese art. The main highlight of the China Art Museum and is a digital animated version of China's most famous painting, Along the River During the Qingming Festival (\u6e05\u660e\u4e0a\u6cb3\u56fe Q\u012bngm\u00edng Sh\u00e0ngh\u00e9 T\u00fa).\nThe Shanghai Natural History Museum is in Jing'an District next to the metro station named after it on Line  1 .\n\n\n=== Art galleries ===\nThe gallery areas are rather scattered, many of them away from the center and in former industrial buildings that have been renovated and re-purposed.\n\nM50 art district is Shanghai's main center for contemporary Chinese art, with dozens of studios and galleries. It is in a former factory in Putuo District.\n1933 Shanghai is in a former abattoir; it has a theatre, shops, caf\u00e9s and studios. See Hongkou for details.\nThe Power Station of Art is on the Huangpu River, in an old power plant converted first to a pavilion for Expo 2010, and then the first state-run contemporary art museum in China. It is in Huangpu.\nThe Shanghai Propaganda Poster and Art Centre is on the west side of the French Concession. A fine collection of Mao-era posters and other memorabilia, a bit hard to find but worth the effort.\nThe Shanghai Gallery of Art is a commercial gallery in a shopping center called 3 on the Bund.\nThe Tianzifang area in the French Concession has many galleries and studios.\nThe West Bund in the French Concession is one of the city's newest art districts. In 2019, French art museum Centre Pompidou established its first Chinese outpost here at the West Bund Museum.\n\n\n=== Temples ===\n\nShanghai many temples, churches, mosques and synagogues.\n\nJing'an Temple (\u9759\u5b89\u5bfa) is a large Buddhist temple in Jing'an District, next to the metro stop (Lines  2  and  7 ) named after it.\nLonghua Temple (\u9f99\u534e\u5bfa) is a Zen Buddhist temple down on the southern edge of the French Concession.\nThe old town has both the Taoist Temple of the Town God (Chenghung Miao) and the Shanghai Confucian Temple (Wen Miao).\nSt. Ignatius Cathedral is a major Catholic church built by the French near Xujiahui.\nHoly Trinity Church is an Anglican cathedral on the east side of People's Square in the old British district.\nJade Buddha Temple is in Putuo, a small Buddhist temple with some fine statues.\nXiaotaoyuan Mosque is Shanghai's largest mosque, with a separate women's mosque next door. It is in Huangpu.\nOf course there are many smaller religious buildings\u2014Buddhist, Taoist, Confucian, Muslim and Christian\u2014scattered around the city.\n\n\n=== Water towns ===\n\nThere are water towns in the Western suburbs, popular with both Shanghai residents and visitors. They are quite scenic with canals as the main method of transport and many traditional-style bridges and buildings.\n\nZhujiajiao is right out at the Western edge of the municipality in Qingpu district, and can be reached on Line  17  from Hongqiao Railway Station, or by bus. It is quite popular with Shanghai residents, both Chinese and expatriates. There are some bars run by expats.\nQibao is closer to downtown in Minhang district, and can be reached by metro line  9 , Qibao station, then walk a block south). It is smaller than Zhujiajiao and gets a higher proportion of tourists.\nFengjing in Jinshan district has many artists, even its own fairly well-known \"Jinshan peasant\" style of painting. Metro line  22  will get you to Jinshan, but you will need a local bus or a taxi to reach Fengjing.\nThis type of town is found all over the Yangtze Delta area. In particular, there are several in the Suzhou and Hangzhou regions as well as in Shanghai.\n\n\n== Do ==\nIndividual listings can be found in Shanghai's district articles\nThe municipal government runs the Shanghai Cultural Information website which has good listings of current events (special exhibits at museums and galleries; shows such as acrobatics at the circus, touring musicians, and plays; sporting events).\n\n\n=== Shopping ===\nIf you like shopping or window shopping, a walk along either of Shanghai's major commercial streets takes an hour or two (or up to several days if you visit many stores and explore side streets) and can be quite interesting:\n\nNanjing Road, starting from the Bund (Nanjing Road East metro station, line  2  or  10 ) and heading west toward People's Park, Jing'an Temple and perhaps beyond\nHuaihai Road in the French Concession, starting at South Huangpi Road metro station on Line  1  and heading west. At the cross street just past the Changshu Road station, turn left (past the Starbucks) to reach a whole district of bars and restaurants along Hengshan Road to end your journey in comfort.\nSee #Buy below for more on these streets and nearby areas.\n\n\n=== Parks ===\nAlmost every district in Shanghai has some parks. Some of the major ones are:\n\nPeople's Park, very central and with a major metro interchange below it (lines  1 ,  2  and  8 )\nJing'an Park, across the street from the temple and metro station (lines  2  and  7 )\nFuxing Park in the French Concession\nLu Xun Park in Hongkou is named for a famous writer. It has kids' rides and a lake with boats for rent.\nGongqing Forest Park in Yangpu also has rides and boats. (Hongkou Stadium station, line  8  and  9 )\nZhongshan Park in Changning. (Zhongshan Park metro station, lines  2   3  &  4 )\nDaning Tulip Park, north of the railway station in Zhabei\nShanghai Expo Park is in two parts, the larger in Pudong and the smaller in Puxi, toward the south of Huangpu. The Power Station of Art (listed under #Art galleries) is in the Puxi part of the park.\nJinjiang Action Park, an amusement park in the southern part of the French Concession. Has a large Ferris wheel with a good view over much of the city. Metro line  1  to Jinjiang Park Station.\nIf you play the game called wei qi in Chinese, or \"Go\" in English, you are likely to find locals playing it in Fuxing Park or Jing'an Park.\n\n\n=== Performing Arts ===\nYue opera (\u8d8a\u5267 yu\u00e8j\u00f9) is the second most popular style of traditional Chinese opera nationwide after Beijing opera, and the most popular style in Shanghai. While it originated in the nearby city of Shengzhou, Shanghai played an important role in the development of the genre, and was instrumental in popularizing it nationwide and internationally. Today, it is widely considered to be the representative traditional Chinese opera style of the entire Jiangnan region. The Shanghai Yue Opera House (\u4e0a\u6d77\u8d8a\u5267\u9662 Yu\u00e8j\u00f9) is home to one of China's premier Yue Opera troupes that often tours the nation, and sometimes performs internationally as well. Besides Shanghai, nationally-renowned Yue Opera troupes can also be found in the nearby cities like Hangzhou, Shaoxing, Nanjing and Wenzhou.\n\n\n=== Other ===\nDrink at a tea house. Visit one of Shanghai's many tea houses. Be careful not to order amazingly expensive teas or too much food. Beware of friendly-seeming strangers wanting to take you to a tea house or bar; this may be a scam.\nTake a boat on the river. Many companies operate river tours. Look for one of the cheaper ones. This is a great way to see the striking Shanghai skyline and river banks and shoot some good photos. Some of the boat companies offer sightseeing tours lasting several hours and covering quite a bit of the river and/or Suzhou Creek. A cheaper, but less scenic, alternative is to take one of the many ferries that cross the river for a couple yuan.\nDouble-decker buses run through much of downtown and can be boarded anywhere on their route.\n China Odyssey Tours, \u260f +86-773-5854000. Tours of the city, for couples and families. \nFormula One. Grand Prix motor-racing is in April at the International Circuit in Jiading district.\nShanghai International Film Festival. The event takes place during a period of ten days in June with a showing of 400 Chinese and international films in cinemas across many districts of Shanghai.\n\n\n== Learn ==\n\n\n=== Universities ===\nShanghai has at least a dozen universities, many with several campuses. Most employ foreign English teachers and many have foreign students.\nTwo are part of the C9 League, a group prestigious universities, roughly the Chinese equivalent of the \"Ivy League\" in the US. These two are generally considered to be behind only Peking University and Tsinghua University in Beijing as the most prestigious universities in China.\n\nFudan University (\u590d\u65e6\u5927\u5b66 F\u00f9d\u00e0n D\u00e0xu\u00e9) is among China's top general universities. The main campus is in Yangpu.\nShanghai Jiatong University (\u4e0a\u6d77\u4ea4\u901a\u5927\u5b66 Sh\u00e0ngh\u01cei Ji\u0101ot\u014dng D\u00e0xu\u00e9), also known by its shortened name \u4ea4\u5927 (Ji\u0101od\u00e0), is among the best for technical subjects. It has five campuses in different districts, and has over 40,000 students including about 24,000 graduate students. The new main campus is in Minhang. The original campus in the French Concession is now used mostly for continuing education; it has an MBA program and Chinese-language courses. Metro line  10  has a Jiaotong University Station, at the original campus.\nThere are also many non-C9 universities:\n\nEast China Normal University (ECNU) also has its main campus in Minhang, next to Jiaoda.\nNew York University in Shanghai is a joint venture between the American school and ECNU, with its campus in Pudong.\nZhabei has the main campus of Shanghai University.\nBaoshan has another Shanghai University campus.\nYangpu has four universities: Fudan, Tongji, Finance & Economics, and Physical Education; the last has a martial arts museum.\nFengxian has Shanghai Business School.\nSonjiang has an entire University town with many universities\nNanhui has eight campuses with around 100,000 students.\nZhangjiang Hi-Tech Park in Pudong has a Fudan campus and the Shanghai Tech University (opened in 2016).\nMost of these have substantial contingents of foreign students, and some employ foreigners as English teachers or in other faculty roles. All of them have nearby areas with cheap food, bars and shops that cater to a student market; these can be among the best places in Shanghai to look for low costs and lively nightlife with a young crowd.\nSome universities have metro stops named for them, Jiao Tong University and Tonji University stations on line  10 , Shanghai University on line  7 , and Sonjiang University Town on line  9 .\n\n\n=== Other classes ===\nThere are also schools for various Chinese arts or crafts including cooking, martial arts and painting. Many are in the French Concession, though other districts have some.\nThere are also schools offering training in the Chinese language. Several of the universities provide such courses and there are other possibilities:\n\n Mandarin House (\u7f8e\u548c\u6c49\u8bed). Established 2004; the Shanghai campus is in People's Square. \n LTL Mandarin School Shanghai, info@ltl-shanghai.com. In the French Concession. For those who are interested, they also conduct Shanghainese lessons for foreigners. (updated Mar 2017)\n5 Meizhi Mandarin (two locations: Xujiahui next to Jiaotong University, and Hongqiao-Gubei), \u260f +86 2152300140, meizhish@gmail.com. 09:00-21:00. Courses in written and spoken Mandarin Chinese, including business and conversational courses, and test preparation. There are short-term intensive classes (group or individual) and longer-term programs, and customized courses can be provided. The school is an official test centre for the HSK Chinese proficiency test and for TCSL (Teaching Chinese as a Second Language). \nHutong School Shanghai offers a range of Chinese courses including intensive, HSK preparation courses, business Chinese and Chinese classes for children. Group and private classes are available with experienced native teachers. Email: shanghai@hutongschool.com Tel: [Tel: (+86) 21 3428 0099]\nThat's Mandarin School offers a variety 1-on-1 and group Chinese language courses including intensive, part-time, HSK preparation. Various summer and winter immersion programs for kids and teens as well as online Chinese classes are also available.\n\n\n== Work ==\nShanghai has over 200,000 foreign residents, most of whom are working, and the range of jobs and professions is huge. The largest groups are English teachers and expatriate employees sent by foreign companies to work in Chinese branches or factories, or to deal with suppliers or partners. There are also significant numbers of other teachers at every level from kindergarten to university, foreign employees of Chinese companies, contractors doing design work on anything from clothing to automobiles, diplomatic staff at the various consulates, artists and musicians, independent professionals such as lawyers and architects, and people running their own export businesses or even factories.\nAs a general rule, the English teachers are paid less than the other groups, though still quite well by local standards. To some extent the range of Western bars and restaurants reflects this; some of the high-end places cater mainly to expatriates with high salaries or generous expense accounts. These places also get some tourists and wealthy Chinese, but the typical foreign teacher (let alone most Chinese or low-budget backpackers) cannot afford them.\nSee below for information on visa extensions if required.\nSee Working in China for additional information.\n\n\n== Buy ==\nIndividual listings can be found in Shanghai's district articles\nMuch of the shopping in Shanghai is either downtown or (mostly for big malls) across the river in Pudong. Many clothing shops are downtown, but others are scattered citywide; see #Clothing for details. There are also many shopping opportunities in the big malls of Pudong, and all the suburban areas have malls as well. Two of the largest malls on the Puxi side of the river are:\n\n1 Cloud Nine shopping center (Zhongshan Park Station, lines  2  and  3 , Exit 1). In Changning. Nine flours above ground (hence the name) and two below. Metro line 2 has an exit on one of the underground floors. (updated Jun 2016)\n Wanda Plaza (Wujiaochang) (line  10 , Wujiaochang). In Yangpu. Wanda Group is a huge company with many properties in China and some elsewhere. This is the largest of their 14 malls in Shanghai. \nWith those exceptions, most of the shopping is downtown\n\n2 Nanjing Road (\u5357\u4eac\u8def  N\u00e1nj\u012bngl\u00f9). Is certainly Shanghai's best-known shopping street, and probably China's. At around a million shoppers a day, it is also one of the world's busiest. It has been busy for generations; Amy Tan's novel The Kitchen God's Wife mentions a figure of 100,000 visitors a day in the 1940s. Nanjing Road starts on the riverside at The Bund and goes about 6 km (3.7 mi) West from there to Jing'an Temple. It continues beyond the temple, gradually changing from intensively commercial to more office and residential use.   \nThe park divides Nanjing Road into two parts:\nNanjing Road East (Nanjing dong lu) in Huangpu District, mostly pedestrians-only and a major shopping area since the mid-19th century. It is a 1-km long pedestrian boulevard running inland from the Bund, lined with busy shops. The wide boulevard is often packed with people on weekends and holidays. The shops are often targeted to domestic tourists, so the prices are surprisingly reasonable. The Nanjing Road East station (lines  2  and  10 ) is near the center of that pedestrian area. The People's Park station (lines  1 ,  2  and  8 ) is at the inland end, furthest from the Bund. Beyond that station the road is no longer pedestrian-only; it runs along the north side of People's Park (\u4eba\u6c11\u5e7f\u573a), which is often considered the center of Shanghai.\nFor high-end international brands, go to Nanjing Road West (\u5357\u4eac\u897f\u8def Nanjing xi lu) near Jing'an Temple station (line  2  or  7 ). Several large shopping malls (Plaza 66 aka Henglong Plaza, Citic Plaza, Meilongzhen Plaza, and others being built) house boutiques bearing the most famous names in fashion.\nThe French Concession is another major shopping area. Huaihai Road is a busy boulevard with upscale stores; well-off locals tend to shop there in preference to the more touristy Nanjing Road. For boutique shopping, head to the smaller streets just off it \u2014 Xinle Lu (\u65b0\u4e50\u8def), Changle Lu (\u957f\u4e50\u8def) and Anfu Lu (\u5b89\u798f\u8def) \u2014 starting from east of Shaanxi Lu (\u9655\u897f\u8def); the nearest Metro station is South Shanxi Rd on Line  1 . This area of low-rise buildings and tree-lined streets bustles with small boutiques of clothing and accessories, where young Shanghainese seek the latest fashion shops. A renovated but still picturesque older area called Tian Zi Fang also has boutique clothing, plus much arts and crafts.\nThe Bund is mainly office buildings but does have some hotels, restaurants, and a few multi-storey high-end shopping centers. No. 3 on the Bund has, among other things, Giorgio Armani's flagship store in China. No. 18 has many stores including an art gallery.\nYuyuan Bazaar in the old town is well provided with Chinese crafts and jewellery. See Shanghai#Clothing for other tourist shopping areas.\n\n\n=== Books, CDs and DVDs ===\nFuzhou Road runs from the Bund on the east to People's Square on the west, and is the first major street south of Nanjing Road. In colonial times it was Shanghai's main red-light district; today it is the best place to look for books and is also a good street to wander around and find stationery and art supplies, especially for Chinese calligraphy and painting. Some of the art is sold there as well.\nShanghai Foreign Languages Bookstore (Shanghai Book Traders) at 390 Fuzhou Rd offers many books in English and other major languages, especially for learning Chinese. Just around the corner at 36 South Shanxi Rd is a small but well-stocked second-hand foreign-language bookshop. If you're searching for computer or business related books, head to the biggest store in Fuzhou Rd: Shanghai Book Town (\u4e0a\u6d77\u4e66\u57ce). You'll find special editions targeted at the Chinese market. The only difference to the original version is the Chinese cover and the heavily reduced price.\nThose interested in music CDs or DVDs of movies and television shows have a wide variety of options. The bookstores all carry some, people sell DVDs out of boxes on street corners, and there are local DVD shops in most neighborhoods. Costs go from about \u00a56 per disk to about \u00a540; you pay a bit more for DVD-9 format disks. See also discussion in the China article.\nThere are also some shops popular with the expatriate community; these tend to have English-speaking staff and a better selection of merchandise appealing to Westerners, though sometimes at slightly higher prices. One is the Ka De Club with two shops: one at 483 Zhenning Rd and the other one at 505 Da Gu Rd (a small street between Weihai and Yan'an roads). Another popular DVD shop is on Hengshan Road about halfway between two expat bars, Oscar's and the Shanghai Brewery. There are several more along Jiaozhou Road, which runs north from Jing'An Station.\nPerhaps the best way to score a deal with a shop is to be a regular. If you provide them repeat business they are usually quite happy to give you discounts for your loyal patronage. It is also worth asking for a cheaper-by-the-dozen discount if you are making a large purchase.\n\n\n=== Antiques ===\nThere are a number of markets in the city selling antiques, jade and Mao-era China memorabilia:\n\n3 Dongtai Road Antique Market (Metro line  8  or  10  to Laoximen station, then walk a long block north looking for the market on side streets to your left.). The largest antique market in the city, and the cheapest provided you bargain hard. \nYuyuan Gardens is another good option for antiques and all manner of cheaply made and priced souvenirs (teapots, paintings, \"silk\" bags, etc.) Walk a few hundred meters East from Dongtai Road.\nThere are more upmarket antique markets between Fuzhou Road and the pedestrian part of Nanjing Road.\nAs with any market in China, don't be afraid to haggle; it is usually the only way to get a fair price.\nExporting anything made before 1911 is now illegal. See the China article for discussion.\n\n\n=== Electronics ===\nShanghai offers the opportunity to buy electronic products, and you may be able to find exotic gadgets and phones that are only available in China. Foreign electronics are expensive with a high sales tax. It can be helpful to buy online with clear cheaper prices and with delivery often possible the same day with payment in cash on delivery. Games consoles are expensive and import restrictions extensive.\nXujiahui is the place to go if you're after computer accessories and other electronics, but the mobile phone selection is a bit lacking. Try to go during the week; it is hectic on weekends.\n\n Bu Ye Cheng Communications Market (\u4e0d\u591c\u57ce) (Shanghai Railway Station, exit 4 from line  1  side, turn left and it's the large gold building). 10:00-18:00. This is the one of the best-known open-style markets for mobile phones in Shanghai. 1F/2F for new phones (two-way radios, too), 3F for second-hand including various collectibles. Any reputable vendor that sets up shop here will allow you to try before you buy\u2014if they don't then leave. Best way to get a good or unusual phone at low cost. The selection is a mixed bag; you'll find Chinese off-brands mixed with reliable big-name brands as well as cutting-edge Japanese phones. If you live in North or South America be careful about buying the off-brand phones as most do not support the necessary frequencies for use there. Also, in the secondhand section of the market some of the phones are of dubious origin; CDMA phones may have their ESNs blacklisted in their home countries, but for GSM/3G phones the only issue is an ethical one. \nThere is a giant electronics mart at the Baoshan Road line  3 / 4  station, which offers a huge range of miscellaneous electronics and mobile phones, however some are fake. Be sure to bargain hard. If you want to buy a mobile phone here, make sure you have a SIM card before you purchase, and test the SIM card in the phone by making a call, perhaps to the vendor, since some of the phones are non-functional but still turn on. It's best to negotiate as low as possible first, and then try out your SIM card.\n\n\n=== Photo equipment ===\nShanghai is rather an odd market for photo equipment. As in any major city, more-or-less everything is available somewhere, including high-end items of interest mainly to professionals and unusual things that only a collector might want. China was relatively isolated for decades, from the Japanese invasion in 1937 until the \"reform and opening up\" of 1978, so imported items from that period are not common. However Shanghai was a very prosperous and cosmopolitan city in the 1920s and early 30s so some collectors' items are in good supply.\nAs a general rule, prices on photo equipment in Shanghai are roughly comparable to US prices and a bit higher than Hong Kong, but there are various exceptions including some real bargains and some seriously overpriced items. Check prices abroad before making any major purchases.\nFor consumer products such as point-and-shoot cameras or low-end interchangeable lens devices, Xujiahui is a shopper's paradise. Any of the large consumer electronics stores scattered around the city, and many of the general department stores, will have these as well, but selection and price are usually better at Xujiahui.\nFor more specialised needs, there are two large buildings full of camera stores in Shanghai. Both have plenty of consumer products, usually at good prices. However they also have lots of products for the enthusiast and professional markets, services such as printing or camera repair, and a large selection of used equipment from cheap-and-usable to collectors' items.\n\nOne is Huanlong Photographic Equipment City (\u73af\u9f99\u7167\u76f8\u5668\u6750) on the 2nd through 5th floors of a building near the Shanghai train station in Zhabei District. Exit the station into the South Square, and the building is diagonally left. Fast food on ground floor. Second floor and above is mostly camera shops. The higher you go, the more used equipment you see.\nAn even larger clump of shops is Xing Guang Photographic Equipment City (\u661f\u5149\u6444\u5f71\u5668\u6750\u57ce) 300 Luban Lu, corner of Xietu Lu. Metro Line  4  to Luban Road South, go out exit 1, turn left onto Luban Lu, and you are walking North. Xietu Lu is the first cross street. The camera center is on the NW corner. It has 7 floors. The top one is offices, the bottom two mostly new cameras. One floor is mostly studio equipment\u2014lights, reflectors and so on\u2014and includes some unusual cameras such as 4x5-inch view cameras and 6x17 cm Chinese-made panoramic cameras. Another is mostly wedding studios, wedding clothes rental, etc. Used equipment is from 2nd to 6th floors and dominates a couple of floors. One camera repair shop, a few accessories shops\u2014memory, bags, tripods, etc.\nThere are two newer buildings next to the main one. In the main building, the bottom two floors are nearly all shops selling new cameras, with much specialisation by brand. At least one shop with nothing but Canon, some only Sony, one only Nikon & Manfrotto, two mainly Pentax. Olympus and Panasonic are fairly common, but no shops sell only those. Voigtlander is visible here and there. The Leica specialists are on higher floors.\nThese two groups of shops are on Line  4  so it is easy to visit both in a day. However, Line 4 is roughly circular and they are on opposite edges (Railway Station on North, Luban Lu on South) so it is a fairly long ride between them.\n\n\n=== Clothing ===\nShanghai has a number of markets which combine cheap clothing (including lots of knock-offs of famous brands) with tourist stuff like souvenir T-shirts and higher-grade Chinese stuff like silk (?) scarves and robes. Nearly all of these also have a few stores selling luggage, and many have some consumer electronics as well. In any of them there are quite a few touts; just entering the buildings can bring a horde of people upon you trying to sell you bags, watches, DVDs and all sorts of goods. You also need to haggle to get good prices in any of them. Dodging touts and haggling can be fun, but those sensitive to the pressure might want to steer clear.\nRather than pursuing knock-offs of Western brands, one of the more interesting things to do in Shanghai is to check out the small boutiques in the French Concession area. Some of these are run by individual designers of clothing, jewellery, etc., so the items on sale can truly be said to be unique, and the area is generally free of touts. Both prices and quality are generally higher than in the markets described below.\nMany visitors from overseas encounter problems finding larger sizes in China. Also the sizes may be different; one Canadian reports that he takes XL at home but needs XXXL in China. This will be less of a problem in tourist areas, and the many fine tailors can make garments to fit anyone, often at attractive prices.\n\nThe horrendously crowded Qipu Lu clothing market (Tiantong Road metro station on line  10  one stop North of Nanjing Road East, and line  12 ) is the main place where Shanghai people look for cheap clothing. It is a mass of shops \u2014 including a huge number of small ones, many about 18 m2 (200 ft2) \u2014 jammed into several multi-storey warehouse-sized buildings; exploring even one would take the casual stroller most of a day. You can walk into the basement of one building from inside the subway stop. You'll find the cheapest clothes in the city here, but even the trendiest styles are clearly Chinese. Bargain hard, in Chinese if you can, and make friends with the shop owners. Many of them have secret stashes of knock-offs in hidden rooms behind the stall \"walls.\" Avoid this place on weekends at all costs.\nWhile Qipu Lu is best known for cheap clothing, and that is indeed the market most shops target, it also has some rather fine upmarket shops. For example, the top floor of the building by the subway has a women's clothing place specialising in silk dresses and tops, including many with good embroidery. Prices start around \u00a5300, high but not outrageous by Chinese standards. Compared to prices in Western countries they are a real bargain.\nAnother large market is next to the Shanghai Science & Technology Museum (\u4e0a\u6d77\u79d1\u6280\u9986) metro station on line  2  in Pudong; there are actually two markets, one on each side of the station. The place has more foreign customers than Qipu Lu, and the asking prices for clothes are higher. However, there is a wider selection here of other products: software, games, electronics, etc. This market also has a number of tailor shops for made-to-order clothing.\nA smaller but more accessible market with similar merchandise (but no tailors) is attached to the largest and most central metro station in town, People's Park. This is less hectic than either Qipu Lu or the Science & Tech Museum, and probably has enough variety for most travellers.\nIt is fairly common for travellers to stop at either the Science & Tech or the People's Park market to pick up gifts just before flying out of Shanghai, since both are on line  2  which goes to both airports, and both are all on a single level so it is moderately convenient to wander about with luggage in tow. Prices may not be the best in town but they are generally much better than airport shops and selection is good.\nThe area around Yuyuan Gardens in the old town has similar merchandise, with more emphasis on souvenirs and handicrafts rather than clothing, and often with somewhat higher asking prices.\nAnother option is the Pearl Plaza located on Yan'an Xi Lu and Hongmei Lu (line  10 , get off at Longxi Rd stop, go south on Hongmei Lu out of the station past Yan'an elevated road). See Minhang for more on that area. Another, more for day-to-day clothing than anything fancy or touristy, is near Shanghai Ikea; take line  3  to Cao Xi Road, walk toward Ikea and it will be on your left.\nThe largest group of tailor shops is at Shanghai South Bund Material Market: 399 Lujiabang Rd (\u9646\u5bb6\u6d5c\u8def), open 10:00-18:00. Three floors of tailors and their materials including silk, cashmere, and merino wool. Have items measured, fitted and finished within two days or bring examples, samples or pictures. Prices here or in the smaller cluster of such shops at Science & Tech are often better than at standalone shops in town because the competition for customers is fairly intense, but you should bargain for the best price.\nYou can take bus #802 or #64 from the Shanghai Railroad Station and stop at the final stop: Nanpu Bridge Terminal or you can take metro line  4  to the Nanpu Bridge (\u5357\u6d66\u5927\u6865) Station (exit from gate #1, make a left from the exit and then left again on the light. You will see it to your right after walking about 200 to 250 m.\nFor high-end clothing that is (mostly) not Chinese knock-offs, generally at somewhat higher prices than outside China, the main areas to look are Nanjing Road right downtown and Huaihai Road in the French Concession. Both have many stores with trendy styles and major international brands. See the Shopping in China article for discussion of difficulties buying brand-name goods in the country, but note that the high-end Shanghai shops are probably less risky than anywhere else.\n\n\n=== Groceries ===\nMajor supermarket chains such as Carrefour, Metro, Auchan, Tesco and Walmart are scattered around the city and have cheap groceries and household products, and are generally crowded at weekends. The most centrally located 'big chain' supermarket is Carrefour located in floors B1 and B2 of Cloud 9 shopping mall (metro: Zhongshan Park, lines  2 ,  3  and  4 ). Tesco has a store in Zhabei district close to the main railway station and there is a huge Lotus supermarket in Top Brands mall in Liujiazui (Liujiazui, line  2 ). There is also a large supermarket with much imported food at Xujiahui (lines  1  and  9 ); leave the station via at exit 12, which puts you in the basement of a major mall, then walk all the way across the open space at that level.\nWhilst many stores around the city sell imported products at fairly high prices, Metro Cash'n'Carry is by far the cheapest place to buy imported goods. There are two stores:\n\nThe Pudong store is at Longyang Lu, Lines  2 ,  7 ,  16  and Maglev.\nThe Puxi store is at the intersection of Zhenbei Rd and Meichuan Rd, reachable by bus #827 from Line  2  Beixinjing station, Line  10  Shuicheng Rd station or Jiaotong University station, or bus #947 from Line  2  Zhongshan Park station and lines  3  and  4  Jinshajiang Rd station. Alternately, it is a five-minute walk from Jinjiang Park station on line  1 .\nAs Metro caters primarily to businesses, you will either need a Metro membership card or take a temporary guest pass from reception when entering the store (Puxi store offers no guest passes but most members are willing to lend their membership card at the check-out line). Some items are available only in large packages or are much cheaper bought that way; for example, 1-kg (2.2-lb) packs of New Zealand cream cheese or 5-kg (11-lb) blocks of Irish cheddar are about half the cost per gram of small quantities.\nCity Shop has a number of locations around Shanghai, plus an online store. Prices are mostly noticeably higher than Metro, but their selection is good and locations are often convenient.\nUbiquitous FamilyMart 24-hour convenience stores can be found around the main central districts and inside major metro stations \u2014 these stores sell magazines, snacks, drinks and Japanese-style hot bento-boxes although prices are high by Chinese standards. Chinese chains such as KeDi and C-Store can be found in residential districts and are marginally cheaper and also stock cigarettes. 7-Eleven and Lawson convenience stores are less common but can be found around the Nanjing Road area.\n\n\n== Eat ==\nIndividual listings can be found in Shanghai's district articles\nMany food options in Shanghai are much as anywhere else in China. A lot of the street food is cheap and interesting; roasted sweet potatoes are a common and low-risk item. Hole-in-the-wall restaurants, especially West-of-China Muslim noodle places or spicy Sichuan places, often have good cheap food as well. The local bakeries are generally reasonably priced and the coffee houses have Western-style baked goods for not much more.\nFor excellent Sichuan food in classier surroundings, Spicy Joint on Huaihai Road is extremely popular; do not go at a peak time unless you are willing to wait for a table.\nWhile there are some good Indian and Thai places, there are also many Japanese curry places in Shanghai. A popular chain is Coco Ichibanya with about a dozen locations from Pudong to Suzhou, mostly downtown. One is in the mall attached to Jing'an Temple metro station, another in Metro City mall at Xujiahui, and another on Huaihai Road.\nThe Wagas chain has restaurants offering coffee and a mostly western menu\u2014mainly light choices like sandwiches, soups and salads\u2014at mid-range prices and \"Baker & Spice\" places which combine a caf\u00e9 and bakery. They offer free WiFi and are a popular spot for locals and digital nomads working on laptops as they sip coffee. Downtown Shanghai has at least one Wagas location in each of the eight #Districts covered in this article, including at least two in Jing'an. The ground-level strip of restaurants behind Grand Gateway Mall at Xjiahui has a Wagas with a Baker & Spice shop next door.\nThere are plenty of places with various sorts of international cuisine, mostly at higher prices than those mentioned above. The largest group are in the French Concession, mostly along Hengshan Road or streets running off it, but there are also many in Jing'an, Huangpu and Pudong, and some elsewhere.\nAs anywhere in China, Brazilian all-you-can-eat barbeque restaurants are common; one is on Hengshan Road. There is also an all-you-can-eat Indian buffet above the Dutch department store on Huaihai Road.\nHuanghe Rd (\u9ec4\u6cb3\u8def), off Nanjing Road has upmarket Chinese-style seafood.\nMuch western fast food is available: McDonald's, Starbucks and KFC are ubiquitous, while Dairy Queen, Pizza Hut, Dunkin Donuts and Burger King are fairly common. Shanghai has a few you might not find (yet?) in smaller cities, such as a Papa John's Pizza on Hengshan Road and a Carl's Jr. burger place at Xujiahui.\n\n\n=== Shanghai cuisine ===\nShanghai's cuisine, like its people and culture, is primarily a fusion of the forms of the surrounding Jiangnan region, with influences sprinkled in from the farther reaches of China and elsewhere. Characterized by some as sweet and oily, the method of preparation used in Shanghai emphasizes freshness and balance, with particular attention to the richness that sweet and sour characteristics can often bring to dishes that are otherwise generally savoury.\n\nThe name \"Shanghai\" means \"above the sea\", but paradoxically, the local preference for fish often tends toward the freshwater variety due to the city's location at the mouth of China's longest river. Seafood, nonetheless, retains great popularity and is often braised (fish), steamed (fish and shellfish), or stir-fried (shellfish). Watch out for any seafood that is fried, as these dishes rely far less on freshness and are often the remains of weeks-old purchases.\nShanghai's preference for meat is unquestionably pork. Pork is ubiquitous in Chinese cooking, and in general if a mention refers to something as \"meat\" (\u8089) without any modifiers, the safe assumption is that it is pork. Minced pork is used for dumpling and bun fillings, whereas strips and slices of pork are promulgated in a variety of soups and stir-fries. The old standby of Shanghainese cooking is \"red-cooked (braised/stewed) pork\" (\u7ea2\u70e7\u8089 h\u00f3ng sh\u0101o r\u00f2u), a traditional dish throughout Southern China with the added flair of anise and sweetness provided by the chefs of Shanghai. Another signature Shanghainese dish is sweet and sour ribs (\u7cd6\u918b\u6392\u9aa8 t\u00e1ng c\u00f9 p\u00e1i g\u01d4, literally sugar and vinegar pork ribs).\nChicken takes the honorable mention in the meat category, and the only way to savour chicken in the Chinese way is to eat it whole (as opposed to smaller pieces in a stir-fry). Shanghai's chickens were once organic and grass-fed, yielding smaller but tender and flavourful birds. Today most chickens are little different from what can be found elsewhere. Still, the unforgettable preparations (drunken, salt-water, plain-boiled with dipping sauce, etc.) of whole chickens chopped up and brought to the table will serve as a reminder that while the industrialization of agriculture has arrived from the West, the preservation of flavour is still an essential element of the local cooking.\nThose looking for lower-cholesterol options need not fret. Shanghai lies at the heart of a region of China that produces and consumes a disproportionately large amount of soy. Thinking tofu? There's the stinky version that when deep-fried, permeates entire blocks with its earthy, often offensive aroma. Of course there are also tofu skins, soy milk (both sweet and savory), firm tofu, soft tofu, tofu custard (generally sweet and served from a road-side cart), dried tofu, oiled tofu and every kind of tofu imaginable. There's also vegetarian duck, vegetarian chicken and vegetarian goose, each of which looks and tastes nothing like the fowl after which it is named but is rather just a soy-dish where the bean curd is expected to approximate the meat's texture. Look out also for gluten-based foods at vegetarian restaurants. If you are vegetarian, do be conscious that tofu in China is often regarded not as a substitute for meat (except by the vegetarian Buddhist monks) but rather as an accompaniment to it. As such, take extra care to ensure that your dish isn't served with peas and shrimp or stuffed with minced pork before you order it.\nShanghainese people have 4 special preferences for breakfast dishes (or rather to say dishes, just those simple and quick-to-eat) which are given the name s\u00ec d\u00e0 j\u012bn g\u0101ng (\u56db\u5927\u91d1\u521a, lit. four heavenly kings, a term in Buddhism). They are the followings:\n\nd\u00e0 b\u012dng (\u5927\u997c, lit. large pastry). A kind of large flat bread. Fried dough in oil-greased frying pan with water (which eventually evaporates). A variation of this is c\u014dng y\u00f3u b\u012dng (\u8471\u6cb9\u997c, lit. green onion oil pastry), which has green onion and salt and pepper on the surface of the dough before frying.\ny\u00f3u ti\u00e1o (\u6cb9\u6761, lit. oily strips). Stretchy while crispy fried hollow strips. Often served with some sugar to dip on.\nc\u00ed f\u00e0n (\u7ca2\u996d). Glutinous rice and Japonica rice mixed and steamed, then used to wrap up a y\u00f3u ti\u00e1o.\nd\u00f2u ji\u0101ng (\u8c46\u6d46, soybean milk). Simply soybean milk, often sweetened with sugar. Best when served with y\u00f3u ti\u00e1o.\nSome other Shanghainese dishes to look out for:\n\nxi\u01ceo\u200bl\u00f3ng\u200bb\u0101o\u200b (\u5c0f\u7b3c\u5305, lit. buns from the little steaming cage; fig. steamed dumpling). Probably the most famous Shanghai dish: small steamed buns \u2014 often confused for dumplings \u2014 come full of tasty (and boiling hot!) broth inside with a dab of meat to boot. The connoisseur bites a little hole into them first, sips the broth, then dips them in dark vinegar (\u918b c\u00f9\u200b) to season the meat inside.\nsh\u0113ng\u200b ji\u0101n\u200b m\u00e1nt\u00f3u (\u751f\u714e\u9992\u5934, lit. raw, fried buns). Unlike steamed buns, these larger buns come with dough from raised flour, are pan-fried until the bottoms reach a deliciously crispy brown, and have not made their way to Chinese menus around the world (or even around China). Still popular with Shanghainese for breakfast and best accompanied by vinegar, eat these with particular care, as the broth inside will squirt out just as easily as their steamed cousins.\nD\u00e0zh\u00e1  xi\u00e8\u200b (\u5927\u95f8\u87f9), or Sh\u00e0ng\u200bh\u01cei\u200b m\u00e1o\u200b xi\u00e8\u200b (\u4e0a\u6d77\u6bdb\u87f9; Shanghai hairy crab), a type of small freshwater crab famed for its taste. Best eaten in the winter months (Oct-Dec) and paired with Shaoxing wine to balance your yin and yang. Roe and meat from this type of crab goes into the famous xiaolongbao (above) and meatballs (below)\nxi\u00e8\u200bf\u011bn\u200b sh\u012b\u200bzi\u200bt\u00f3u\u200b (\u87f9\u7c89\u72ee\u5b50\u5934; lit. crab meat pork meatballs), found in various Yangzhou- and Zhenjiang-style restaurants, such as the Yangzhou Fandian located near Nanjing Road.\n\n\n=== Western food ===\nHaving been home to concessions of various European countries and the United States for much of the 19th and the first half of the 20th centuries, Shanghai has developed its own unique style of Western food known as Haipai cuisine (\u6d77\u6d3e\u897f\u9910 h\u01ceip\u00e0i x\u012bc\u0101n). It is broadly divided into five different styles, namely German, French, Italian, Russian and British. Among the more popular Haipai dishes include Shanghai-style borscht (\u7f57\u5b8b\u6c64 lu\u00f3s\u00f2ng t\u0101ng), fried pork chops (\u70b8\u732a\u6392 zh\u00e1 zh\u016bp\u00e1i), potato salad (\u571f\u8c46\u8272\u62c9 t\u01d4d\u00f2u s\u00e8l\u0101) and baked clams (\u70d9\u86e4\u870a l\u00e0o g\u00e9l\u00ed).\n\n\n== Drink ==\nIndividual listings can be found in Shanghai's district articles\nMost of the places mentioned under #Eat above also serve booze, and the rest have coffee and tea.\nThe traditional alcoholic drink of choice for the Shanghainese is Shaoxing rice wine, and this can still be found in most restaurants.\nPrices of drinks in caf\u00e9s and bars vary like they would in any major metropolis. They can be cheap or budget-busters, with a basic coffee or beer costing \u00a510-40. In a high-end hotel bar, one basic beer may cost as much as \u00a580. Western-style caf\u00e9s and bars have also become commonplace. There are internationally-known chains, like Starbucks and Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, as well as popular domestic and local java joints to satisfy those looking to relax. Hong Kong-style tea caf\u00e9s are also common, as are Asian \"pearl milk tea\" or \"bubble tea\" bars. Some traditional tea houses can still be found, especially in the Old City.\nTsingtao, Snow and Pearl River beer are widely available. Major foreign brands are produced domestically and smaller brands are typically imported. There is also a local brew known as REEB (beer spelled backwards). A large bottle (640 ml) of any of these costs anywhere from \u00a52-6.\nShanghai is filled with amazing nightlife, complete with both affordable bars and nightclubs that pulsate with urban energy. There are plenty of bars in all areas, with the biggest concentration in the French Concession. Xintiandi in particular has many upmarket bars and nightclubs, many with live music. Gay bars are concentrated in the French Concession and the Xinhua Road Residential District in neighboring Changning district.\nThere are many magazines for expats available at hotels and expat eateries, listing and reviewing events, bars, clubs and restaurants in Shanghai. The most popular are That's Shanghai, City Weekend, and Time Out. Shanghai also has an English newspaper, Shanghai Daily, and an English-medium TV channel, International Channel Shanghai or ICS; most expats find these better than the corresponding national media outlets, People's Daily and CCTV channel 9.\n\n  Pub Crawl Shanghai, Various locations, \u260f +86 187-2100-4614. 17:00-03:00. In addition to a plethora of watering holes ranging from bars, lounges, dives and world-class clubs, there is a pub crawl that arranges transportation to various popular venues. For non-Mandarin speakers or those in town for just a few days, this service takes the guesswork out of finding the hippest, most interesting spots that bustle with expatriates and locals. \u00a5150. \n\n\n== Sleep ==\nIndividual listings can be found in Shanghai's district articles\nAccommodation in Shanghai can be rivaled by few cities in China, in terms of both variety and services. There are establishments for all types of travelers, from backpacker options for the weary to top-of-the-line hotels and serviced apartments for those wishing to be spoiled. Puxi has both new and old hotels with classy architectural styles and charm, some of them described in stories when Shanghai may have been the only place in China known to much of the rest of the world, while modern amenities commonly found in Pudong rival many hotels in Asia and beyond.\nFor clean, safe, budget accommodation, three reliable options are the Jin Jiang Star (website in Chinese), Motel 168 (website in Chinese)  and Motel 268 chains, all of which have locations in most districts of Shanghai.\nFor long-term accommodation, be prepared to splurge as Shanghai's real estate prices are among the highest in the world, rivaling even those of major Western cities.\nIf your budget allows it, all the downtown districts except the Old City have high-end hotels, and Pudong across the river has many others. Prices are near international levels, anywhere from around \u00a5700 a night to several times that. Most of the big international chains have at least one location in Shanghai, and many have hotels in both Pudong and central Puxi; Hilton has those plus a third one at Hongqiao Airport. Many of these hotels are in very convenient locations; Les Suites and Hyatt are on the Bund, Le Meridien is just off Nanjing Road, and Radisson is on People's Square; see Huangpu for listings. In Jing'an, the Shangrila is right next to the temple and metro station, and in the French Concession, the Langham Xintiandi is close to Xintiandi and the old town.\nShanghai also has some grand old hotels built in the art deco style during the city's glory days (1840s-1930s). The Peace Hotel and Astor House are on the Bund and the Park Hotel is across from People's Park on Nanjing Road; all are listed in the Huangpu article. These are often somewhat cheaper than the newer luxury hotels.\nQuite a few low-priced and mid-range places are in the area north of Jing'an Temple, in Jing'an, Zhabei and Putuo districts. For a more central location the Captain's Hostel is a backpacker place just off the Bund. Backpacker dorms are under \u00a5100 in most places, while many hostels and most of the plainer hotels can provide private rooms with private shower in the \u00a5250-600 range.\n\n\n== Stay safe ==\nShanghai, despite its size, is a very safe city, and violent crime is incredibly rare; it is generally not a problem for women to roam the streets alone at night. Petty crimes like pickpocketing and bike theft can sometimes occur, though they are not as common as they used to be with the ubiquity of CCTVs these days. Sexual harassment occasionally occurs on crowded public transport. Pay extra caution before the Chinese New Year (in Jan or Feb depending on lunar calendar), as thieves may be more active in looking for new-year money.\nAlthough pickpocketing is not as rampant as in major European cities, it pays to be prudent, especially in crowded public transport and the main shopping streets. Pickpockets often work in groups, sometimes including women carrying babies.\nBeware of this taxi scam: first you agree on price (e.g., \u00a5300 for a taxi shared with someone else from Hongqiao Airport to Suzhou) then after a short taxi ride they ask to get out and a group of people say that you need to pay agreed money right now. Then you are transferred to a shared bus where other people cheated like yourself wait until the bus departs, then the bus finally gets to its destination. Most taxis belong to a taxi company, with the company telephone number printed in the taxi that you can call in English. There is also a common Shanghai help-line number that can help you, call 962288, with English service.\nThe notorious tea house scam, long practised in Beijing, is unfortunately spreading to Shanghai as well. Be cautious of overly friendly strangers, probably well-dressed, speaking good English, and look innocent like a student. They will invite you to an art gallery, tea shop or karaoke bar, and after accepting they will leave you to foot a large bill. In this case, you should call 110 (emergency hotline). The con artists may tell you that calling the police does not work and claim to have connections with police, but the police in China tend to be helpful in these cases, especially when innocent foreigners are involved. These scams can be found around People's Square near the entrances/exits of the museums and art galleries. Actual physical harm to yourself is unlikely. Just walk away.\nA temple scam in various big cities and also Tibet is when your guides may ask you to make a wish and burn a stick of incense which ends up costing a hundred to more than a thousand. Another trick is to ask you how much you want to \"donate\". After you said \u00a510, they will tell you that \u00a510 is for a one-day blessing but the monk has already turned an incense to bless you for 1 year, so you have to pay 365 x \u00a510. This scam has caused significant backlash because of blasphemy since no legitimate temples in China ever charge followers in this way.\nMale travellers may attract attention from female sex workers at nightspots. Remember that prostitution is illegal in China, so you could face potential legal consequences should you partake. Around the Old Town and the Science Museum in Pudong, hawkers are sometimes also eager to sell. Saying w\u01d2 b\u00fay\u00e0o (\"I don't want it\") may help. Also be cautious of people who approach and offer to polish your shoes. Make sure both of you agree on the price before anything is put on your shoes. The same rule also applies to the commercial photographers at the Bund area. They will offer to take your picture with the scenic background (and sometimes with costumes) for \u00a550, but once you have contracted their services, several cohorts will arrive to \"assist\" the photographer. They may force you to buy all the snapshots and try to gather crowds to increase pressure.\nDon't rush into or out of Shanghai metro trains at the last moment. Despite the safety barriers on the platform, the train doors sometimes close before all passengers have boarded; people squeezed between closing doors is a common sight. Apparently, the failsafe that is supposed to block trains from running with open doors isn't foolproof: In 2010 a woman died after being smashed against the safety barriers as she was hanging half out of the closed doors of a train leaving Zhongshan Park Station.\nBy Chinese law, foreigners are required to show their passports when requested, although this is rarely enforced. Most hotels will help you keep the passport in the safe, and then you can carry a photocopy along with your hotel's name card.\nSee the Chinese Money Counterfeiting article for details about fake notes that you may encounter.\n\n\n== Stay healthy ==\nSee the Chinese Stay Healthy article for general health and food advice.\nSee the Chinese Smog article for information about issues relating to air pollution\nDo not drink Shanghai's tap water unless it is boiled or goes through a reverse-osmosis filter. Drinking the water is relatively safe when it has been boiled; however, tap water is also said to contain high amounts of heavy metals which are not removed by boiling. When buying bottled water you will come across a whole range of foreign and domestic mineral water brands, with the cheaper domestic brands costing \u00a51\u20132.50 available in all convenience stores and from street vendors. Most hotels provide domestic mineral water for free in your room.\nIndividuals with asthma or respiratory issues should be prepared when visiting due to the air pollution.\nPublic hospitals in Shanghai are generally not up to the standard that foreigners from Western countries would be used to, and most of the doctors and nurses working there are unable to communicate in English. Ambulance services are unreliable, and in the event of an emergency, the quickest way to get to a hospital would usually be to take a taxi. Many private hospitals and medical clinics around the city mainly cater to foreigners and expatriates. The doctors and nurses working at these places will be able to speak English, and the standard of care is usually on par with what you may be used to at home, though their services are usually very expensive. Many of these medical services will take travel insurance if your insurance company is partnered with the hospital. Generally speaking you will likely have to pay ahead of time, however these facilities tend to be far superior in equipment and cleanliness to the ones that Chinese locals are forced to deal with.\nA popular chain of western medical clinics is Parkway Health. There is a 24-hr hotline in English (6445 5999) to arrange an appointment in the clinic nearest you. This service is expensive: basic medical consultations start at \u00a51,200. Check with your insurance beforehand to see if you are fully or partly covered.\nNote that because these services are pay services, they are paid more when they conduct more tests. Furthermore, Chinese doctors, even Western-trained ones, tend to be overly thorough compared to Western doctors. However since you are a customer, they are not usually too insistent on unnecessary tests. Use your common sense to determine if you need the ordered tests (e.g. blood tests, x-rays etc.).\n\n International Medical Care Center of Shanghai First People's Hospital, 585 Jiu Long Road, near Haining Lu, Hangkou  (\u4e5d\u9f99\u8def585\u53f7\uff0c\u8fd1\u6d77\u5b81\u8def) (in Building 1), \u260f +86 6324 3852.

For international calls add 86, the country code for China.\nShanghai seems to have far fewer Internet caf\u00e9s than other Chinese cities, but there are some; see the district articles for details. Most of the bars that cater to the expatriate community and many of the foreign-based fast food chains \u2014 Starbucks, KFC, Dunkin Donuts and likely others \u2014 offer free WiFi. Many hotels also provide WiFi service at prices from free to exorbitant; it is moderately common to find free service in one part of a hotel, such as a coffee shop, but substantial charges elsewhere, such as from the rooms.\n\n\n== Cope ==\n\n\n=== Media ===\n Shanghai Daily.

English-language TV channel \nExpatriates generally find these Shanghai-based media outlets preferable to the China-wide People's Daily and CCTV-9.\nThere are also several English-language papers consisting mainly of listings, reviews and advertisements for restaurants and nightlife. These are given away free in most of the Western-style bars and some restaurants and hotels.\n\n\n=== Operator assistance ===\nAn amazingly helpful resource for visitors and expats alike is the Shanghai Call Center. Established prior to the Expo and maintained as a public service, the call center is a free-of-charge phone number that provides information regarding bus, metro, and taxi directions, business hours, attractions, and can even be utilized as a free translation service. If you are having trouble communicating with your taxi driver or a vendor, don't hesitate to call the number and pass the phone back and forth, having the operator translate.\nThe so-called \"Magic Number\" can be reached at 962288 from Shanghai cell phones. Chinese cell phones from other cities should dial 021 962288, and international phones should dial +86 021 962288. A short message in Mandarin will greet you, followed by a set of English instructions. Service is available in several European languages such as English and Spanish.\nThe service itself is free of charge, but you pay the cost of the phone call.\nAccording to Smart Shanghai, the city has another English-language help hotline that offers almost the same services as the Shanghai Call Centre. For anyone seeking English-language assistance, call 12345, then for English press 7; you will be asked to press the 'number sign', which means the pound key (#). Services are only offered in Chinese and English, however, they claim to be able to connect to volunteers speaking French, German, Italian, Spanish, Korean, Russian and Arabic. The hotline is run by the city government as a service for residents to help with anything related to either public or civil services, while also answering general questions about the city such as how to deal with registrations and licenses, as well as the opening hours of venues.\n\n\n=== Etiquette ===\nSee the China article for discussion of some Chinese behaviours that may irritate visitors, but note that most of these are less problematic in Shanghai than elsewhere.\nCrowding in, rather than queuing, is a problem you are likely to encounter; indeed this can be worse in busy Shanghai than elsewhere. Whether at a ticket booth, at a busy fast food counter, or even at the grocery store, everyone jockeys for position by crowding around a staff member, and will do whatever possible to get in first, and get out. If at all possible, avoid the situation in the first place; for example, recharge your metro card a bit early if you see a quiet ticket counter.\nPushing in the metro is normal, especially at the chaotic People's Square Station. Just dig in and push; don't feel sorry. However, compared to public transport in other Chinese cities, the Shanghainese are better at letting people alight first and the mad rush for empty seats is not quite so bad \u2014 your behaviour should follow the situation: if the station is crowded then pushing is acceptable, but if not then you are more likely to be looked upon as an 'uncivilised foreigner'. Also, outside of busy times you should stand to the right on escalators, to allow people to pass.\nNote that Shanghai Metro drivers will close the train doors and depart when the schedule says so, even if people are still boarding. When you hear the 'door closing' alarm (usually a series of beeps), stand back from the doors (particularly on the old Line 1 and 2 trains as the doors close very quickly and may not re-open if blocked).\n\n\n=== Work permits and visa extensions ===\nPlease refer to Working in China for general information about Chinese work visas. For specific information on the process in Shanghai, see the article for Pudong where the Entry and Exit Bureau is located.\n\n\n=== Consulates ===\nMost consulates can be found in the Jing'an area of Shanghai.\n\n  Australia, Level 22, Citic Sq, 1168 Nanjing W Rd, \u260f +86 21 22155200, fax: +86 021 22155252. \n  Belgium (\u6bd4\u5229\u65f6\u9a7b\u4e0a\u6d77\u603b\u9886\u4e8b\u9986), No. 127 WuYi Road \u6b66\u5937\u8def127\u53f7, \u260f +86 21 64376579, fax: +86 021 64377041, Shanghai@diplobel.fed.be. 09:00-12:30, 14:00-16:30. \n  Brazil (\u5df4\u897f\u9a7b\u4e0a\u6d77\u603b\u9886\u4e8b\u9986), Jiangning Rd 188, ASA Building, 7/F -703 200041, \u260f +86 21 6437-0110, fax: +86 21 6437-0160, notarial.xangai@itamaraty.gov.br. 09:30-13:00. \n  Canada, 8th Floor, ECO City Building, 1788 Nanjing Rd W (About 100m west of Jing An Temple on the same side of Nanjing Road), \u260f +86 21 32792800, fax: +86 021 32792801, shngi@international.gc.ca. 09:00-11:30. \n  Finland, Room 2501-2505,CITIC Square, 1168 Nanjing Xi Rd, \u260f +86 52929900. \n  France (\u6cd5\u56fd\u9a7b\u4e0a\u6d77\u603b\u9886\u4e8b\u9986), Haitong Securities Bldg, 2F, 689 Guangdong Rd \u5e7f\u4e1c\u8def689\u53f7\u6d77\u901a\u8bc1\u5238\u5927\u53a62\u5c42, \u260f +86 21 61032200, fax: +86 6103 2218, info.shanghai-fslt@diplomatie.gouv.fr. 09:00-12:00, 14:00-18:00. \n  Germany, 181 Yongfu Lu, Xuhui District \u5f90\u6c47\u533a\u6c38\u798f\u8def181\u53f7, \u260f +86 21 3401 0106.

These are comfortable and reasonably priced and, except at holidays, are not too crowded since other trains are cheaper. Look for the separate ticket windows with \"CRH\" on the signs.\n\nHangzhou \u2014 45 minutes away by high-speed train, is one of China's top domestic tourist destinations, featuring the famous West Lake, a fine silk market, and Buddhist caves. The popular times of year to go are spring and fall. An information booth at the train platform exit provides a useful booklet with maps.\nSuzhou \u2014 a historic town half an hour away from Shanghai by high-speed train, is also a major destination for Chinese tourists. Traditionally a city of scholars and poets with many fine classical Chinese gardens and enough canals that it has been called the \"Venice of the East\". It has also become a major center of hi-tech manufacturing.\nThere is a Chinese saying along the lines The sky has heaven; the Earth has Suzhou and Hangzhou.\n\nNanjing \u2014 about 1.5 hours away by high-speed train, is a great place to get a Chinese history lesson. Nanjing was the capital of China under several dynasties, and of the Nationalist government in the early 20th century. From the city walls to the Presidential Palace, it's a walkable, friendly place with a variety of hotels for all budgets. Well worth the effort. It is also home to the tombs of three prominent figures in Chinese history.\nWuxi \u2014 roughly halfway between Suzhou and Nanjing, known for the Grand Canal, Lake Tai, the giant Buddha at Lingshan, and delicious local cuisine.\nNingbo \u2014 is two and a half to three hours away from Shanghai, across the 36 km-long Hangzhou Bay Bridge. The train, via Hangzhou, is faster.\nThere are places that serve as the somewhat rural escapes for Shanghai residents. These are near cities mentioned above, and probably neither would seem at all rural to someone from a less densely populated country.\n\nMount Putuo, a very scenic island with an important Buddhist temple, near Ningbo. One of China's \"Four Great Mountains of Buddhism\".\nSee East China for other cities and attractions in the area around Shanghai."

        "title": "Dublin",
        "extract": "Dublin (Irish: Baile \u00c1tha Cliath, \"Town of the Hurdled Ford\") is the capital city of Ireland. Its vibrancy, nightlife and tourist attractions are world renowned and it's the most popular entry point for international visitors to Ireland.\nAs a city, it is disproportionately large for the size of the country with a population of over 2 million in the Greater Dublin Region (2022); nearly half of the Republic's population lives in this metropolitan area. The central sights can be navigated by foot, with a few outlying sights, and suburbs sprawling out for miles.\nThe climate is mild, making Dublin a year-round destination. It's seldom freezing in winter, cool in summer and frequently has light showers. For more information, see County Dublin weather chart.\n\n\n== Understand ==\n\n\n=== History ===\nDublin is in a low-lying, fertile area, not boggy by Irish standards, and with good sea access. It became the core of the Gaelic kingdom of Leinster, and the Vikings established a large settlement by what is now Dublin castle, until ejected by Brian Boru at the Battle of Clontarf in 1014. This set a pattern that Dublin was fought for, not fought in. The Normans colonised the southwest and Leinster from the 12th century, and further out they battled with the Gaels, but Dublin sat snug within the \"Pale\" \u2014 the defensive palisade. Similarly with the Tudor conquests; then the city fell swiftly to Cromwell so his atrocities were elsewhere, and King William marched in unopposed after the Battle of the Boyne. 18th century Dublin was the second largest city in the British Isles, with a tight little Protestant clique ruling the place to London's liking. Industry and culture flourished, and the city acquired its graceful Georgian streets and squares, but Ireland was ruled as a colony. Britain's other colonies watched with great interest as the independence movement gathered pace.\n\"The Troubles\" of the late 19th and early 20th century involved ethnic conflicts, paramilitary gangs, and savage reprisals by the authorities. The outbreak of the First World War seemed to put a brake on this, with tens of thousands of Irishmen marching away to France and Flanders. Surely one big push on the Somme would win this war - but while the generals were planning this, armed insurrection broke out at Easter 1916. The rebels seized the central Post Office on O'Connell Street, read their proclamation of independence, then were bombarded until they surrendered. Initially they attracted little sympathy or support, especially as they were backed by arch-foe Germany, but the authorities snatched defeat from a quick win by the subsequent court-martials and executions by firing squad. Hundreds were arrested and 15 were shot. This and atrocities such as the Croke Park massacre were fatal to the legitimacy of British rule. By 1921, the Irish tricolour fluttered over a Dublin that was capital of a separate state.\n\n\n=== Orientation ===\n\nDublin is divided by the River Liffey. North of the Liffey runs O'Connell Street the main thoroughfare, intersected by numerous shopping streets such as Henry Street and Mary Street. On the south bank are Merrion Square, St Stephen's Green, Grafton Street (the main southside shopping area), Trinity College, Christ Church and St Patrick's Cathedrals, the main branches of the National Museum, and many other attractions.\nThe postal district Dublin 1 is north of the river centred on the Post Office, Dublin 2 is south centred on Trinity College, and so on out to the suburbs. These districts have been incorporated into Eircodes, which cover the whole Republic. Thus D04 followed by four alphanumerics is somewhere around Ballsbridge. These pages state Eircodes wherever possible, as keying them into an online map will drop you onto the exact address. They only apply to addresses that receive mail so a lonely megalithic tomb on a mountainside won't have one, but that's seldom an issue in downtown Dublin.\nVisitor info: Several places purport to be tourist information offices, but are simply agencies selling tours. The official source of advice is Visit Dublin, with two walk-in centres:\n\nNorthside at 14 O'Connell St Upper D01 WP59, 200 yards north of the post office, M-Sa 9AM-5PM;\nSouthside at 3 Palace St D02 T277, next to City Hall west end of Temple Bar, M-Sa 9AM-5PM, Su 10:30AM-3PM.\n\n\n== Get in ==\n\n\n=== By plane ===\nMain article: Dublin Airport\n1 Dublin Airport (DUB IATA) (10 km north of city centre). Dublin Airport has an extensive short and medium haul network, and is the base for Aer Lingus, Aer Lingus Regional, and Ryanair. Terminal 2 handles wide-bodied jets and is used by Aer Lingus (& Regional), American Airlines, Delta, Emirates, Norwegian and United. All others use the older Terminal 1, some 300 m north with a walkway between. Together they offer direct flights from most major cities in the UK (serving all London airports, but most frequently Heathrow) and Europe (including Keflav\u00edk, Moscow and Istanbul). North American flights arrive from New York, Newark, Boston, Chicago, Orlando, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington (with pre-clearance of US customs & immigration westbound) and Toronto. Middle East flights include Dubai, Doha and Abu Dhabi. Domestic flights are from Kerry and Donegal; there are none from Belfast, Shannon or Cork. All the main car hire companies have kiosks in Arrivals. There's a better choice here than in the city centre, but book ahead for the best deals. The airport has car parking short-term on-site, long-term off-site, and \"meet & greet\" services. The currency kiosks are run by ICE with a 10% buy/sell spread, decent value. Radisson Blu and Maldron hotels are at the airport, with a few more at the M1/M50 junction just south and in Swords to the north.   (updated Jun 2024)\nBetween airport and city: bus and taxi are the options, there's no rail / metro link.\n\n Aircoach. Aircoach 700 runs to the city centre from T1 then T2, every 15-30 min,taking 30 min, fare in 2024 is \u20ac10 single or \u20ac15 return. The last bus to the city is 1:30AM then the next is 6AM. See below for Aircoach 701, 702 and 703 for south side of Dublin. They also run to other cities such as Cork and Belfast. Taxi drivers routinely try to pick up passengers waiting at the Aircoach stop: they're forbidden to do so, but offer a similar rate and get many takers, so they persist. (updated Jul 2024)\nDublin Express runs to city centre and Heuston Station every 10 minutes or so. The last bus to the city is 11PM then the next is 5:30AM. The cost in September 2024 was \u20ac8 single. \u20ac10 return if purchased online.\n\nLocal buses by Dublin Bus are much slower \u2014 allow an hour \u2014 but much cheaper at \u20ac2.60 in coins, or \u20ac2 if paying with a Leap Card (see \"Get around\"), and may be more convenient for the suburbs. The two routes are:\nBus 16 via Drumcondra railway station, O'Connell St, George's St and out to the southern suburbs of Rathmines and Ballanteer / Kingstown. It runs from morning until late evening.\nBus 41 via Drumcondra railway station and O'Connell St, passing near Bus\u00e1ras, to Lower Abbey St. Northbound it runs out to Swords. It runs 24 hours every 20-30 minutes.\nStops for the local buses are at Terminal 1 through the car park opposite Arrivals exit and then to the right. Pay with exact coins (bus drivers don't accept cards or banknotes, and don't give change). Alternatively, purchase a prepaid Leap Card (see \"Get around\") from a convenience store in the terminal or near the bus stops. Luggage space is limited on these local buses, and it's not unknown for drivers to turn away travellers with packs that cannot be stored.\nTaxis to city centre might cost \u20ac34-40 (July 2024), so they are competitive with the Aircoach for a group of three or more. See \"Get around\" for rules on taxis.\nOther destinations: most buses to other Irish cities run via the airport, see individual cities' \"Get in\". Within County Dublin:\n\nBus 101 runs every 20 min to Balrothery, Balbriggan and Drogheda. This bus runs from Dublin Talbot St via Drumcondra but is not available for journeys just between city, airport and Swords.\nBus 102 runs from the airport every 30 min to Swords, Malahide, Portmarnock and Sutton near Howth.\nDrumcondra (Bus 16 & 41) has trains from Connolly towards Maynooth.\nAircoach Bus 700 runs to Leopardstown and Sandyford, 702 to  Bray and Greystones, and 703 to D\u00fan Laoghaire, Dalkey and Killiney.\n\n\n=== By train ===\n\nThe country's railways converge on the city: see Irish Rail for timetables, fares and online tickets, and see also Rail travel in Ireland.\n2 Connolly (St\u00e1isi\u00fan U\u00ed Chonghaile), Amiens St, Dublin 1 (200 m north of bus station). Ticket office 6:30AM-7PM. This serves the north plus the east coast, with trains from Sligo (3 hr), Belfast via Drogheda (2 hr), and Rosslare ferry port via Wexford and Wicklow (3 hr). From Derry change in Belfast. Connolly is also the hub for local DART trains. It has toilets, ATM and small shops, and a bar and restaurant. The surrounding area is tacky at night; the station is closed between midnight and 5AM M-Sa, 7AM Sunday. Many Irish railway stations are named for those executed for their part in the Easter Rising - the British thoughtfully ensured plenty names to go round - and this one is named for labour organiser James Connelly (1868-1916). (updated Jun 2024)\n3 Heuston (St\u00e1isi\u00fan Heuston), St Johns Rd West, Dublin 8 (2 km west of city centre, on LUAS tram red line). Ticket office 7AM-9PM. This serves all directions except the north or the east coast. Trains run from Cork (2\u00bd hr), Galway (2\u00bd hr), Westport (3\u00bd hr), Limerick (2 hr 15 min) and Waterford (2 hr). There are connections from Ballina, from Tralee and Killarney, from Clonmel and Tipperary, and from Nenagh. Heuston has toilets, ATM, small shops, kiosks and cafes, plus supermarkets on the streets nearby. To reach the centre take the tram. The station is named for railway worker Se\u00e1n Heuston (1891-1916). (updated Jun 2024)\nAllow 45 min if you need to transfer between Heuston and Connolly.\n\n\n=== By bus ===\n4 Bus\u00e1ras bus station is just south of Connolly railway station and 300 m east of O'Connell Street. It has Bus Eireann services from most towns in Ireland, such as Belfast (2 hr 30), Cork (4 hr), Limerick (3 hr 30), Galway (4 hr) and Donegal (2 hr 30), all running via the airport. Other operators are Kavanaghs from Limerick and Waterford, and Citylink and GoBus from Galway. Eurolines 871 runs on Saturday evening from London Victoria via Birmingham, Holyhead and the ferry to reach Dublin city centre early Sunday morning; the reverse run leaves Dublin Friday evening. The station has luggage lockers and pay-to-enter toilets in the basement.\nOther bus companies don't use this station but leave from stops in the nearby streets.\n\n\n=== By boat ===\n\n5 Dublin Port has ferries from Holyhead in Wales (Stena and Irish Ferries, 3 hr 30 min), Bootle near Liverpool (P&O, 8 hrs and  Douglas, Isle of Man (Isle of Man Ferries, 3 hr 30 min). From Cherbourg in Normandy and  Pembroke in Wales they nowadays only sail to Rosslare and not to Dublin. \nThe port is 2 km east of the centre; the number 53 bus connects the port to the bus station by Custom House in central Dublin. The bus usually only accepts Leap Cards. or coins: occasionally a driver will accept payment by notes or cards, but this is the exception. There is no facility for buying Leap Cards at the port. Foot passengers opting to walk to or from the port should avoid Alexandra Road. The M50 tunnel (toll) allows motorists to disembark at Dublin and drive straight onto the motorway without getting snarled in city centre traffic.\nThe former ferry port of D\u00fan Laoghaire is no longer used.  Another ferry route is the short crossing from Cairnryan in Scotland to Belfast, then by road or rail to Dublin.\n\n\n=== By car ===\nIf you're visiting just for a day trip, don't bring a car into the congested centre, use a Park & Ride. From the south, use either Sandyford Luas stop, just off junction 15 of M50 on Blackthorn Rd, or Bray DART stop on Bray Rd. From the west, use Red Cow Luas stop, off junction 9 of M50. From the north east, use Howth DART station. Park & Ride spaces cost \u20ac4 all day, though you've the tram or train fare to add on.\n\n\n== Get around ==\n\nYou can see much of the city on foot.\n\n\n=== By public transport ===\nPublic transport in Dublin consists of trains, trams and buses. Unlike many other European capitals, the rail network in Dublin is quite limited, so buses are by far the main mode of public transport. Public transport is not run by a single agency, but by a number of state-contracted operators, and most information is provided separately on each operator's website. Trains are run by Irish Rail and trams by Luas, while most buses are run by Dublin Bus, except some local buses in suburban areas which are run by Go-Ahead Ireland.\nTransport for Ireland (TFI) is the umbrella brand for public transport in Ireland, although its website primarily just directs you to the individual operators websites for information. However, the TFI Journey Planner is a good way to plan your journey across different modes, and the Live Departures provides real time information for all rail and bus stops. TFI also provides a number of smartphone apps including a journey planner and real time departures. Note that the journey planner app also provides real time departures, so you don't need to download both. The TFI Journey Planner and Live Departures are also integrated into Google Transit and are available within Google Maps.\n\n\n==== Tickets and Leap Card ====\nOn trains and trams, tickets can be purchased from ticket vending machines at the station or stop prior to boarding. Train tickets are valid for the day of purchase and are needed to get through the entry and exit turnstiles at stations. Tram tickets do not have to be validated prior to boarding, but must be used within 90 minutes of purchase. On buses, you can pay the fare to the driver when boarding, but you must have the exact amount in coins. Banknotes cannot be taken, and if you overpay in coins, no change is given.\nIf you plan to use public transport a lot, consider getting a TFI Leap Card, which you can top up with credit and use to pay fares on all public transport in the city, at a 30% discount. Leap Cards can be purchased from most convenience shops at just \u20ac5 for adults and \u20ac3 for children (this is actually not a charge but a deposit, and if you register your card online, it can later be refunded to an EU bank account or a number of charities). You can check your credit and top up the card at most convenience shops, at train or tram ticket vending machines, and on your phone with the Leap Top-Up App.\nTo use your Leap Card on trains or trams, you need to tag-on by holding your card against the turnstile or validator before boarding, and then tag-off again at the turnstile or validator at the end of your journey. You will automatically be charged the relevant fare between the tag-on and tag-off locations. To use your Leap Card on buses, you can place the card on the driver's machine, and tell the driver where you are going, and they will deduct the relevant fare. If you know that you are making a longer journey, you can instead hold your card against the other validator on the right hand side of the door, where you will automatically be charged the highest fare. Unlike trains and trams, you don't need to tag-off when you leave the bus. It's important to note that if you don't tag-on before travelling, you don't have a valid ticket, so you could be fined if a ticket inspector boards and checks your card.\nSingle fares are around 30% cheaper with a Leap Card than with cash. A 90-minute fare applies, meaning that after you tag onto any mode of transport, you can use the same Leap Card to tag onto any other Dublin regional buses, trams or trains within the next 90 minutes without extra cost. The fares are also capped, so once you reach a certain amount within the same day or week (Monday to Sunday), you can continue to travel for free for the remainder of that day or week. For adults, the daily caps are \u20ac5.60 for buses or trams, \u20ac7.60 for trains and \u20ac8 for all modes. The weekly caps are \u20ac22 for buses or trams, \u20ac29.60 for trains and \u20ac32 for all modes. Child caps are much lower, about one third of the adult caps.\nA special Leap Visitor Card is also available for tourists, which allows unlimited use of all public transport for 1 day (\u20ac8), 3 days (\u20ac16), or 7 days (\u20ac32), starting from the time of first use. This can be purchased at arrivals in Dublin Airport (WH Smith and Wrights in Terminal 1 and Spar in Terminal 2) in some city centre tourist offices, or ordered online for delivery. Once your chosen time period expires, you can also top it up with additional time periods at most convenience shops in the city.\n\n\n=== By train ===\n\nInter-city, commuter and DART trains use the same track, but vary in the stops they make. For timetables, route maps and fares, see Irish Rail. \n\nDART (Dublin Area Rapid Transit) is a suburban line along the coast, from Howth and Malahide in the north to  Bray and Greystones in the south, via Connolly and other city centre stations, D\u00fan Laoghaire and Dalkey. Trains run 6AM-11PM and the core section between Howth Junction and Bray has trains M-F every 10 min and Sa Su every 30 min. North of Howth Junction, alternate trains head either for Malahide or for Howth. South of Bray, every third train extends to Greystones. Change at Bray for inter-city trains to Wicklow, Wexford and Rosslare.\nCommuter trains fan out to towns within an hour or so of the city.\n- North from Connolly to Drogheda, along the coast via Portmarnock, Malahide, Donabate, Rush, Skerries and Balbriggan. They're hourly, daily, and rush-hour trains extend to Dundalk. Change at Drogheda for Newry and Belfast.\n- West from Connolly to Maynooth via Drumcondra, Castleknock, Clonsilla and Leixlip. There's a branch line from Clonsilla to Dunboyne and M3 Parkway, which is the P&R for the Navan and Trim area. They're hourly, daily; change at Maynooth for Mullingar, Longford, Boyle and Sligo. Another branch line connects Grand Canal Dock with Connolly and Drumcondra.\n- Southwest from Heuston to Portlaoise via Park West & Cherry Orchard, Clondalkin, Adamstown, Hazelhatch & Celbridge, Sallins (for Naas), Newbridge, Kildare, Monasterevin, and Portarlington. They're hourly M-Sa and every two hours on Sunday. The branch line from Grand Canal Dock also connects M-F via Connolly and Drumcondra, bypassing Heuston to join the route at Park West & Cherry Orchard as far as Hazelhatch & Celbridge.\nConnolly and Heuston are the principal stations, see Get in. Others that visitors might use are on the DART line south from Connolly:\n\n- Tara Street just south of the river for Temple Bar and Trinity College\n- Pearse for Merrion Square and the National Museums\n- Grand Canal Dock for southside dockland and the start of the canal\n- Lansdowne Road for the stadium\n- Sandymount for Ballsbridge\nFares: The short hop zone covers all DART and commuter rail services as far as Balbriggan, Kilcock, Sallins and Kilcoole. As of 2021, a standard single is \u20ac2.25-6.20 adult and \u20ac1.25-2.55 child. Paying by TFI Leap Card it's \u20ac1.70-4.90 adult and \u20ac0.80-1.94 child. Day return, 1 day, 3 day, 7 day and monthly tickets are also available. A family all day ticket is \u20ac20, for up to 2 adults and 4 children; it's rail-only and doesn't include tram or bus. (See Rail travel in Ireland for other ticket deals, some of which are thoroughly bad value.) Your ticket is valid for any train so if you were at Bray waiting for the Dart service back to city centre, and the inter-city from Rosslare happened to pull in, you could hop aboard. \n\n\n=== By tram ===\n\nLuas, Irish for \"speed\", is Dublin's tram system. Trams are modern and reliable, and run frequently from 6AM to midnight. There are two lines:\n\nRed line is east-west, from The Point in dockland and Connolly Station to Bus\u00e1ras, Abbey Street, Heuston Station, St James's Hospital, Red Cow P&R then either Tallaght P&R or Cheeverstown P&R and Saggart in the southwest of the city.\nGreen line is north-south, from Broombridge to TU Dublin Grangegorman Campus, Marlborough St southbound / O'Connell St northbound, Trinity College, St Stephen's Green, Dundrum, P&Rs at Balally, Stillorgan and Sandyford, Leopardstown, Carrickmines P&R and Brides Glen in the southeast of the city.\nThe lines cross in north city centre, with a 100-m walk from the Abbey Street stop on the Red line to the Green lines north or south, a block apart at that point. \nYou must buy your ticket before boarding: there are machines by all the stops. Visitors are only likely to use the outer sections for the Park & Rides. For the city centre zone, e.g. between Heuston and Connolly, in 2024 it's \u20ac1.70 adult standard and \u20ac1.30 by Leap Card. Day return, 1 day and 7 day tickets are available.\n\n\n=== By bus ===\n\n\n==== City network ====\nAn extensive network of 150 bus routes serves most parts of the city and its surrounding suburbs. Most buses in the city centre pass through the O'Connell St area (including Mountjoy and Parnell Squares, Eden Quay and Fleet St) and the Trinity College area (including Pearse St, Nassau St, Dame St and College Green). Services vary from high frequency routes running every few minutes all day, to lower frequency routes running every hour or less, to peak-only limited-stop \"Xpresso\" routes and weekend-only late night \"Nitelink\" routes.\nConfusingly, the bus network in Dublin is run by two separate companies, with timetables listed on two separate websites, and displayed at stops in two different formats. However, both companies share the same fare structure and Leap ticketing system, and all routes are included in the Transport for Ireland Journey Planner and Real Time apps:\n\nDublin Bus operate all cross-city routes, and all routes which run to and from the city centre. The timetables displayed at stops refer to the time the bus leaves the terminus, not the time it will be passing that particular stop, so there is a bit of guesswork required.\nGo-Ahead Ireland operate local routes in the suburbs, as well as orbital routes which avoid the city centre. In contrast to Dublin Bus, all Go-Ahead Ireland timetables displayed at stops refer to the times buses are due to be passing that particular stop.\nA detailed map of the entire city network, colour coded by frequency is available here (and for the far outer areas see here).\nCash fares within the city (exact amount in coins only) are \u20ac2.15-3.80 adult and \u20ac1.00-1.60 child, while if paying with a TFI Leap Card are \u20ac1.55-3.00 adult and \u20ac0.80-1.26 child. Those paying with a TFI Leap Card can also benefit from a \u20ac1 discount if interchanging within 90 minutes, and maximum daily and weekly caps. See Tickets and Leap Card.\nAt busier stops, an electronic sign lists the next 4 to 6 real-time departures. For all other stops, real-time departures can be checked online or in TFI apps (see By public transport above). All buses display their route number and destination on the front. When you see your bus approaching, hold out your hand to signal to the driver that you want to get on, otherwise they may not stop. If you have a prepaid TFI Leap Card, enter on the right-hand side and tag on by holding your card against the reader. Otherwise enter on the left-hand side to pay the driver.\nInside the bus, small screens display the next stop in both Irish and English, along with an audio announcement in both languages. When you see or hear your stop being announced, press one of the red buttons to signal to the driver that you want to get off.\n\n\n==== Principal routes ====\n\nCross-city buses are operated by Dublin Bus and ply every 10 minutes M-Sa and 20-30 min on Sundays:\n\nBus 4 from Harristown and Ballymun in the north to Ballsbridge and Blackrock in the southeast.\nBus 15 from Clongriffin and Artane in the northeast to Templeogue and Ballycullen in the southwest. It runs 24 hours, every 30 min overnight.\nBus 16 from Dublin Airport and Santry in the north to Rathfarnham and Ballinteer in the south.\nBus 27 from Clare Hall and Artane in the northeast to Walkinstown and Tallaght in the southwest.\nBus 39a from Ongar and Blanchardstown in the northwest to Baggot Street and University College Dublin in the southeast. It runs 24 hours, every 30 min overnight.\nBus 40 from Charlestown and Finglas in the northwest to Ballyfermot and Liffey Valley in the west.\nBus 41 / 41c operate from Swords, Santry and Drumcondra in the north to Abbey Street in the city centre, with alternate buses (route 41) serving Dublin Airport - this runs 24 hours, every 30 min overnight.\nBus 46a from Phoenix Park northwest to University College Dublin, Stillorgan and D\u00fan Laoghaire southeast.\nBus 130 from Abbey Street in city centre to Clontarf, Bull Island and St Annes Park to the northeast.\nBus 145 from Heuston Station in the inner west to University College Dublin, Stillorgan and Bray in the southeast.\nBus C1 / C2 from Adamstown and Lucan to Heuston station, the Quays, Ballsbridge and Sandymount. Together they run 24 hours, every 30 min overnight.\nBus G1 / G2 from Spencer Dock to St James Hospital Ballyfermot then either Red Cow tram terminal or Liffey Valley Shopping Centre. Together they run 24 hours, every 30 min overnight.\nSeveral orbital routes skirt the city centre, run by Go Ahead, usually daily every 20-30 min: \n\nBus 17 runs south, from Rialto via Terenure, Rathfarnham and University College Dublin to Blackrock.\nBus 17a runs north, from Blanchardstown via Finglas, Ballymun, Santry and Coolock to Kilbarrack.\nBus 18 crosses the inner south, from Palmerstown via Ballyfermot, Kylemore, Crumlin, Rathmines, Ranelagh and Ballsbridge to Sandymount.\nBus 75 crosses the outer south, from Tallaght via Rathfarnham, Ballinteer, Dundrum and Stillorgan to D\u00fan Laoghaire.\nBus 175 takes the same route to Dundrum then heads to University College Dublin.\nBus 76 crosses the west, from Tallaght via Clondalkin, Liffey Valley and Ballyfermot to Chapelizod, with a few extending to Blanchardstown.\nAt night: in summary the 24-hour bus routes are 41 (the only night bus from the airport), 15, 39a, C1 / C2 and G1 / G2. You pay the normal daytime fare for these. \nNitelink buses are extras from midnight Friday and Saturday to 4AM, on 15 routes radiating from D'Olier Street, Westmoreland Street and Aston Quay. They run every hour or two, for instance to Portmarnock, Howth, Balbriggan, Bray and Greystones. You pay a little more for these. Their service is outbound-only then they return to the city empty, so drunks and wastrels can't use them as an overnight doss. As if, in Dublin?\nSee also individual towns for their overnight services from the city.\n\n\n=== By bike ===\n\nHiring a bicycle is a handy way to get around if you want to get outside the very centre of the city and are comfortable cycling in traffic. That being said, the city is not very bicycle-friendly, either in terms of quantity & quality of bike paths, pedestrians and drivers honouring the bike paths, road space available where there is no bike path (i.e. numerous narrow roads), or driver attitudes in general.\nWhen cycling in the city centre, be aware that cycle lanes, where they exist, are generally shared with buses, taxis, motorcycles, and parked cars; cyclists should pay particular attention when approaching bus stops where a bus is pulling out. Motorbikes are not allowed to use the cycle lanes, but many still do so. Passing on the left is also allowed only in limited circumstances but is in fact still common. When cycling in Phoenix Park,  while there is a dedicated cycle lane on both sides of the main thoroughfare unfortunately pedestrians also use these.\nThere are bikes to hire in several locations around the city centre with the Dublinbikes scheme. A 3-day pass (which is the only pass available to non-residents) costs \u20ac5 and gives you access to the bikes. They are free for the first 30min, up to 1h rentals cost \u20ac0.50 and up to 2 hours cost \u20ac1.50, so it is a good idea to return the bikes frequently. You can purchase the 3-day pass only at stations which accept credit cards, but once purchased you can use it to rent bikes at any station. Your credit card will be preauthorized with a security deposit of \u20ac150, which will be charged in case of theft or if the bike was not returned within 24 hours. Among others, there is a Dublinbikes bike hire place located at the entrance to the Phoenix Park, Dublin 8.\n\n\n=== By car ===\nDon't drive if you can realistically avoid it. For instance, if you plan to see Dublin before touring the country, take the bus in from the airport and return there a few days later to hire your car. For a day-trip, use the city edge Park & Rides. If you do venture in, you face traffic congestion (even on Sunday), difficulty parking, confusing one-ways or diversions for road repairs, traffic congestion, drunken revellers and phone-entranced jaywalkers veering into your path, ill-signed but rigidly enforced bus lanes, the silent onrush of trams, and traffic congestion, traffic, traffic....\nOn-street meter parking is in short supply and only for brief periods, and if you over-stay you're likely to be clamped or towed, for a penalty in excess of \u20ac100. For a visit say to a museum you need to seek out a multi-storey car park \u2014 plan ahead for those you might use. Check also what the deal is with your accommodation; a central place may not have its own parking.\nDublin's outer road is M50, which starts from the port downtown and tunnels beneath the north city (toll) to the airport perimeter, where M1 continues north towards Belfast while M50 arcs round the western city with access to all arterial routes. There's another toll between Junctions 6 (N3 Blanchardstown) and 7 (N4 Lucan). Tolls are about \u20ac3, but in rush hour the tunnel is \u20ac10. There are no cash booths, you must pay online either in advance or by 8PM next day, else there's a penalty (to which your hire company and credit card will gleefully add). Hire cars may come with an e-tag.  \nThe Outer Orbital Route, or M45, is a proposed bypass further out, arcing round from Drogheda to Navan, Enfield and Newbridge. The government keeps confirming this plan but nothing has happened; it would carve through important sites such as Hill of Tara. Meanwhile the same name is also used for the Outer and Inner orbital routes within the M50 semicircle. These are just existing streets interconnecting between the radial roads, confusingly signed and with much zigzagging.\n\n\n=== By taxi ===\nTaxis in Ireland can be identified by the yellow plate on the roof. Have nothing to with unofficial taxis.  \nFares are nationally regulated so you pay the same stuck in traffic trying to reach the airport as you do up a back lane in Connemara. Taxis are required to use the meter, to accept credit and debit cards as well as cash, and not to surcharge any card. However it's \u20ac3 extra for booking instead of hailing on the street or using a taxi rank, and phone apps may impose a further charge. Fares are revised every two years so from Dec 2024 you pay:\n\nStandard rate (M-Sa 8AM-8PM): Flagfall (then 500 m or 85 sec) \u20ac4.40; then Tariff A (next 15 km or 43 min) \u20ac1.32 / km or \u20ac0.47 / minutes to max \u20ac23.60; then Tariff B \u20ac1.72 / km or \u20ac0.61 / min.\nPremium rate (M-Sa 8PM-8AM, all day Sunday and most public holidays): Flagfall \u20ac5.40, Tariff A \u20ac1.81 / km or \u20ac0.64 / minutes to max \u20ac31.80; then Tariff B \u20ac2.20 / km or \u20ac0.78 / min.\nSpecial rate (Sa Su midnight-4AM, 24 Dec 8PM through Christmas to 8AM 26 Dec, 31 Dec 8PM to 8AM 1 Jan): same as Premium rate but after flagfall you go straight to Tariff B, there's no Tariff A.\n\n\n== See ==\n\nDublin's top attractions sell out in summer. Buy tickets online in advance if you know you want to see something, especially for the Book of Kells where even early arrivals may find all the day's slots are filled.\nThe Dublin Pass gives you free and fast track entry to thirty-some attractions in Dublin. Adult prices in 2024 are \u20ac79 for one day, \u20ac109 for two, \u20ac129 for three, \u20ac154 for four and \u20ac164 for five, child prices about half, and days must run consecutively. You'll struggle to break even on this deal as only the Hop-on Hop-off bus tour and the Jameson Distillery and Guinness tours charge over \u20ac25; most are way cheaper. The Pass doesn't include the National Museum sites (free anyhow), the Library and Book of Kells at Trinity College, or any public transport.\n\n\n=== North of the river ===\n1 GPO Museum, O'Connell St Lower D01 F5P2, \u260f +353 1 872 1916. M-Sa 10AM-5PM. The GPO is the headquarters of the Post Office in Ireland, built in Neo-Classical style 1814-1818. In 1916 it was occupied by Irish rebels led by PH Pearse, who read the Proclamation of the Republic outside the front door of the building. The interior was burnt out by shelling from government forces against the rebels, but the exterior survived. Subsequently the GPO was restored, reopening in 1929, and remains a busy working post office. The museum within it is a multimedia exploration of the Easter Rising. Adult \u20ac17, conc \u20ac15, child \u20ac8.50.   (updated Jun 2024)\nO'Connell Street is the broad thoroughfare running north from the river, and the main district for budget accommodation. It was smashed up in the 1916 uprising and subsequent civil war, but rebuilt; then in the 1970s the developers made one sorry mess of it. And their assistants: All along O'Connell Street the pieces flew, up went Nelson, and the pillar too... was the ditty commemorating the 1966 IRA bombing of Nelson's Column. Where it stood, next to the GPO, is now the 121-m pin of the Spire of Dublin; close by on North Earl St is the James Joyce Statue. Northbound trams glide up the street: go a block east for the southbound track. The city council are doing their best to further improve the place but it's a work in progress: pleasant enough by day, but tacky by night.\n2 St Mary's Pro-Cathedral, 83 Marlborough Place D01 DX9, \u260f +353 1 874 5441. Daily 9AM-5PM. Dublin's Catholic cathedral, built in 1825. Catholicism was always the majority religion in Ireland, but its practice was forbidden until the 19th century. The official cathedral is Christ Church, so designated by the Pope in 1300, but taken over by the Protestants in the 16th century. When the laws relaxed, St Mary's was built in neo-Classical style as a temporary or \"pro\"-cathedral, until such time as the Pope decrees otherwise or the Protestants hand back Christ Church. Neither event appears imminent.   (updated Jun 2024)\n National Leprechaun Museum, 2 Mary's Abbey D07 X6R6 (Tram to Jervis), \u260f +353 1 873 3899. Su-Th 10AM-6:30PM, F Sa 10AM-8PM. The \"little folk\" appeared in lore around 1300 AD but only flourished from the 19th century Celtic revival, dressed in late Georgian garb in an idealised rural past, mending a shoe. They proliferated into the silliest of 20th century Irish tourism, like greenfly upon the Rose of Tralee, and fell out of fashion.

Tu-Sa 10AM-5PM, Su 11AM-5PM. Sir Hugh Lane (1875-1915) was one of the first collectors of modern art. He died in the sinking of Lusitania and this public gallery reflects his Will, which involved about as much negotiation, fudge and compromise as the Treaty for Irish independence. The permanent exhibitions are mostly contemporary Irish artists, plus Francis Bacon's studio, relocated from London in 2001. Charlemont House was built in 1763 and in 1929 its gardens were built over to create the gallery, which is wheelchair accessible. Free.   (updated Jun 2024)\nGarden of Remembrance across the street from the gallery and museum commemorates those who died in the struggle for Irish independence.

He never lived here himself. (updated Jun 2024)\nSaint Saviour is a confident neo-Gothic church on Dominick St Lower, west of the Rotunda. Built in 1853, it's the Priory of the Dominican order, who also worship at St Martin's Chapel on Parnell Square.\n\n4 Ha'penny Bridge is the one on all the picture postcards and film locations, a 43 m cast-iron arch spanning the river between Liffey St Lower and Wellington Quay. Officially called the \"Liffey Bridge\" (Droichead na Life), it was built in 1816 to replace the cross-river ferries, with the right to charge a ha'penny toll for the next century. There were turnstiles at both ends, removed in 1919 after the toll ceased. The bridge was extensively repaired in 2001. Please don't clutter it up with \"love-locks\" - the last big clean-up removed 300 kg of these, and bear in mind that those repairs were by Harland and Wolff, builders of the Titanic.\nDownstream from O'Connell Bridge the river broadens into dockland and the open sea, with poignant reminders of the Irish people's relationship with that sea.\n5 The Famine Memorial on Custom House Quay depicts victims of the Great Famine (an Gorta M\u00f3r) of 1845-49, when a million died and another million fled the country. Five gaunt figures totter to the docks with their bundles as if to take ship and leave. Or perhaps they hope for scraps from those ships, which during the famine years were briskly exporting food for profit, plenty to feed everyone yet unaffordable to most.\n6 EPIC The Irish Emigration Museum, CHQ, Custom House Quay D01 R9Y0 (Tram to George\u2019s Dock), \u260f +353 1 906 0861.

Adult \u20ac15, child \u20ac10.  (updated Jun 2024)\n7 Samuel Beckett Bridge , designed by Santiago Calatrava, is a harp-shaped cable-stay road bridge of 120 m. It spans the river between North Wall Quay (in Docklands, north bank) and Sir John Rogerson's Quay (near Grand Canal Square, south bank) and the whole contraption hinges through 90 degrees to let ships pass. Daytime it's busy with traffic and is most scenic when floodlit at night. Calatrava also designed the James Joyce bridge upstream.\n8 Green on Red Gallery, Park Lane, Spencer Dock D01 Y821, \u260f +353 87 245 4282, info@greenonredgallery.com. M-F 10AM-6PM.

Built in the 1740s, its first occupant was Lord Viscount Molesworth and his family, and after him came a series of Right Honorable This and Viscount That and Bishop of Wherever. But the union with England in 1801 drained power and money to London, and the neighbourhood went downhill. Rural folk flocked to Dublin after the famine, so the building was broken up into tenements, with 100 living here. From the 1930s the inner city drained out to new suburbs, and No 14 fell derelict in 1970 before being preserved. Visit by guided tour. Adult \u20ac10, conc \u20ac8, child \u20ac6.

Kells: May-Sep M-Sa 8:30AM-7PM, Su 9:30AM-5PM; Oct-Apr M-Sa 9:30AM-5PM, Su noon-4:30PM. Trinity College is the fine Georgian campus of the University of Dublin. It's generally open to stroll around in daylight hours, but it is a working university, and most interiors are off-limits to tourists. You can visit the Chapel near the front (west) gate of the College. But the big attraction is the Old Library and Book of Kells. Book online, otherwise buy your ticket from the machines under the Lecky library just south. This is for a timed slot, and at weekends may be booked out. You enter an exhibition hall setting the Book in the context of other monastic writings of its period, circa 800 AD. Next enter the display area: only two pages are displayed at any time, one being richly illustrated with little text (or no text, on the \"carpet\" pages), and one page being text of the Vulgate Gospels, written in Insular Majuscule Latin. But it's difficult to enjoy, with crowds jostling round the display case. Next, go upstairs into the massive Long Hall of the library, with books and ladders and more books and ladders towering away upwards. Last but not least, exit through the gift shop, which can be entered without a ticket. Adults \u20ac25, conc \u20ac20, child \u20ac15.

Irish distilleries have for too long pumped out bland commercial fare, though the country has all the ingredients and know-how to produce whiskey of character to rival single-malt Scotch. Standard tour \u20ac20. (updated Jun 2024)\nTemple Bar is the district just west of the College along the riverside, with wall-to-wall pubs and eating places. Its cobbled streets are thronged with merry-makers, and by late afternoon the hen parties and lads' outings are steaming, raucous and upchucking.\nIrish Rock & Roll Museum is at Curved St, Temple Bar D02 RD26, open daily 10:30AM-4PM, adult \u20ac22.\n\n12 Molly Malone is the subject of a 19th-century music-hall ballad, pushing her wheelbarrow and crying \"cockles and mussels alive, alive-oh\" before dying of a fever. She's entirely fictional, though Dublin had many such street-hawkers, and she's not to be confused with Mary Mallon of Cookstown, the all-too-real \"Typhoid Mary\". Her kitsch statue dates to 1988 and was installed on nearby Grafton Street, but moved to its present spot in 2014 to make way for tram tracks. She's often mocked as \"The Tart with the Cart\" or \"The Trollop with the Scallop\" and her breasts (above an unhistorical low-cut dress) have been well polished by passing hands. Alas amidst these misogynist tropes and gropes, we forget the sad fate of the cockles and mussels themselves.\n13 National Gallery of Ireland, Merrion Square West D02 K303 (another entrance on Clare St), \u260f +353 1 661 5133.

Amazing display of Ireland's artefacts from prehistory through the Viking era to independence. The standout is the Treasury (with the 12th century Ardagh Chalice and 9th century Tara Brooch), and the prehistoric jewellery: gold and silver beautifully worked and carved - then chucked into the bog?? And likewise into the bog went bodies, presumably of defeated foes and heinous criminals given the violence of their deaths. Normally when a body is buried, the flesh decays and a skeleton persists. But if you throw a body into a peat bog, the acid dissolves the bones while tannin preserves the hide. The person turns into a handbag. Free.   (updated Jun 2024)\n Leinster House, Kildare Street D02 TK75, \u260f +353 1 618 3000. This opulent Georgian mansion is in the same block as the Archaeology Museum. Designed by Cassels, it was built in 1745 as the residence of the Duke of Leinster at a time when the southside was unfashionable. It proved an \"anchor development\" and Dublin's centre of power and culture soon gravitated from the northside. From 1922 it became the temporary base of the Oireachtas, the Irish bi-cameral parliament, and like the Ulster border it remains temporary over a century later. Tours are only available if you're sponsored by a TD or senator.  (updated Jun 2024)\n15 National Museum of Ireland - Natural History, Merrion St Upper D02 F27, \u260f +353 1 677 7444.

(updated Jun 2024)\n \n16 Merrion Square  is a large stately square filled with grassy and shady areas and surrounded by Georgian red-brick houses. At the northwest corner is a life-sized statue of the writer and dramatist Oscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wills Wilde (1854-1900), who grew up at No. 1 here. He's depicted sprawled on the embankment, with a lop-sided smirk, as if totally wasted. (As if! And him with the hollowest legs in London!) Two short marble columns are covered in his quotable quotes. On the surrounding buildings, plaques commemorate other notable residents, such as the Duke of Wellington. The fine architecture continues south, along Mount Street Upper and Fitzwilliam Street Lower.\n17 St Stephens Green  is a pleasant Victorian public park, open in daylight hours. The Fusiliers' Arch was erected in 1907 to commemorate the Royal Dublin Fusiliers who fell in the Second Boer War (1899-1902).\nMoLI the Museum of Literature Ireland is south side of St Stephens, open daily 10:30AM-5:30PM, adult \u20ac14.50, conc or child \u20ac12.\n18 Little Museum of Dublin, 33 Pembroke St Lower D02 FK06, \u260f +353 1 661 1000.

Donation. (updated Jun 2024)\nThe Grand Canal marks the southern boundary of the inner city; the Royal Canal similarly loops across the northern city. Both were built in the 18th and 19th century to carry passengers and freight between Dublin and the Shannon and Atlantic. The Grand Canal took 47 years to construct: the expense of crossing the Bog of Allen replicated the prehistoric custom of sinking gold into bogs. And indeed Irish waterways go that far back, as the earliest dwellers could barely get about by land. Waterways Ireland website gives information eg on walks, navigability and fishing on this and the other canals.\n\n\n=== West city ===\nThe original Dublin was in this area, at the confluence of the Poddle (now culverted) and the Liffey.

Sir Alfred Chester Beatty (1875-1968) was an American mining magnate who amassed a fabulous collection of early books and manuscripts and oriental art. He moved to London and collaborated generously with the British Museum, but in 1950 there was a falling-out and he moved to Ireland. He established the library to avoid his collection being split up; it's now in the Clock Tower in the Castle gardens. Donation \u20ac10.

So this is the oldest building in Dublin, though it underwent a massive restoration in the 1870s. It became Protestant under Henty VIII, apart from a brief Roman Catholic interlude in 1690 when the exiled James II was campaigning in Ireland, and the Vatican still claims it. The oldest part is the large crypt, where amongst the items on display are a mummified cat and rat, which got themselves stuck in the church organ in the 19th century.

Founded in 1191, it became Anglican at the Reformation, so the Protestants had two cathedrals in the same city while the Catholics had none. It feuded with Christ Church over rights and precedence, until 1871 when Christ Church was nominated the senior church for Dublin and Glendalough and St Patrick's for the rest of Ireland. Jonathan Swift, author of Gulliver's Travels, was dean of St Patrick's from 1713 to 1745 and is buried here, as is his lady friend Stella Johnson. It was rebuilt in the 1860s into a confident pile of Victoriana, and anything that looks medieval is probably a 19th century concoction. Adult \u20ac10, conc \u20ac9.

It includes Dublin Zoo, the residences of the President of Ireland and of the US Ambassador, the Cross commemorating the Pope's visit in 1979, a monument to the 1882 assassinations here, several sports fields, and a herd of fallow deer. Just beyond is Farmleigh mansion. But no phoenix, the name derives from Irish fionn uisce \u2014 \"clear water\". The closest entrance to city centre is 500 m northeast of Heuston station, or take buses 25/26/66/67 to Parkgate St.\nPresident's Residence (\u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in) can be visited by free guided tour on Saturdays.

The Royal Dublin Society is based here and promotes many cultural events. Get here on Bus 4 or 7, but it really ought to be an embassy limo.\nDonnybrook is separated from Ballsbridge by Herbert Park and is prosperous rather than opulent. It's best known for Donnybrook Fair, founded in 1204 and lasting until 1855 by which time it was a byword for drunkenness, fighting and hasty marriages. Yes, the bus will do for this area, the 46a.\nRanelagh and Dartry are also worth a look. Ranelagh is small but affluent, reached by the Luas Green line and with several well-regarded eateries.\nSandymount, a coastal suburb 3 km southeast of the centre, is an affluent area that was the birthplace of WB Yeats, and features prominently in James Joyce's Ulysses. There is a grand walk from Sandymount across the north end of its beach to the South Bull Wall which reaches a finger well out into the Bay.\n29  University College Dublin (UCD)  is now a \"city-within-a-city\" on Belfield Campus.\n30 Rathfarnham Castle, Rathfarnham Rd D14 KT36, \u260f +353 1 493 9462.

Patrick Pearse (1879-1916) saw Irish culture and language as essential for national independence. His one and only case as a barrister was his unsuccessful defence of a Donegal tradesman for using an \"illegible\" sign, and the verdict effectively made Irish signage illegal. He set up a language school in 1908, which moved here in 1910. He was also a leading Republican, reading the proclamation of independence on the GPO steps in the Easter Rising of 1916. He was court-martialled and shot nine days later. Free. (updated Jun 2024)\n\n\n=== North suburbs ===\n\nDrumcondra is a relatively affluent Victorian suburb along the valley of the River Tolka (An Tulcha, \"the flood\", as property owners know to their cost). The Royal Canal bounds it to the south: this has a good towpath and is navigable all the way to the Shannon. (Remarkably, its backers lost even more money than those of the Grand Canal.) On its east side is Croke Park, the centrepoint of Gaelic sports. To the west it runs into Glasnevin, which has the National Botanic Gardens, Glasnevin Cemetery and good restaurants. Many bus routes come this way, and commuter trains towards  Maynooth stop at Drumcondra.\n32 Glasnevin Cemetery (Reilig Ghlas Na\u00edon), Finglas Rd D11 XA32 (Buses 9, 13, 40 from O'Connell St or 40a/40d from Parnell St), \u260f +353 1 882 6500. Daily 9AM-5PM. This opened as an RC cemetery in 1832, in an era when the Catholics weren't allowed their own parish churches, and their burials were begrudged affairs in Protestant ground. Glasnevin has grown and grown, expanding south across Finglas road into the St Paul's section, but the famous names are north side. You can visit the cemetery free, but to make sense of it go to the visitor centre (daily 10AM-5PM, closed M Tu in winter). Walking tours visit the graves of Daniel O'Connell, Charles Stewart Parnell, Michael Collins, Eamonn De Valera and many others of historic or architectural interest.

Here on 23 April 1014 was the battle at which Brian Boru defeated Leinster and their Viking allies but was killed himself. Clontarf has a 4.5-km promenade, traversed by Buses 104, 130 and 32X from the city, so it's a popular seaside outing. (Don't take the train, which runs inland.) St Anne's Park was the estate of the Guinness family home, and has ponds, follies, walks and a Rose Garden. Clontarf Island has disappeared beneath the waves, but in 2004 archaeologists were astounded by a Moai or Easter Island statue that now stands near the pier, until they read in the newspapers that it was a replica gifted by the government of Chile.\n34 Bull Island  is reached by two causeways. The South Bull and North Bull were sandbanks, and a confounded nuisance for navigation into Dublin; works to clear them began in the 18th century but the sea always won. In the 19th century a wall was built that funneled the estuary outflow, scouring the channel so the South Bull washed away while the North Bull grew into the present island. So it's not short of sand, and the 5 km Dollymount Strand is Dublin's best beach. The southern half of the island is a birdlife reserve and the north is St Anne's golf course. The south causeway from Clontarf, the \"Wooden Bridge\", was built in 1819 as a temporary access while the wall was built, but they decided to keep it: it's a single lane, traffic-light controlled.

There are various walking tour companies and freelance tour guides available in Dublin.

They have walking tours and self-guided MP3 tours. \n Dublin Literary Pub Crawl, 'The Duke Pub', 9 Duke St, Dublin 2 (Just off Grafton St). 2. This is the most ingenious crash course in Irish literature, history, architecture and pub bonhomie yet devised... It combines street theatre with the 'craic' that makes Dublin pubs the liveliest in Europe. It is a highly enjoyable evening that gives you the pleasant notion of replacing brain cells as you drown them. The tour is a kind of rough guide to the cultural, religious and political life of the city. Performances by professional actors are central to the experience, not forgetting a fun-filled quiz with prizes for the winners.

The water of Vartry reservoir at Roundwood is commended in Joyce's Ulysses but the characters go boozing instead. Poulaphouca at Blessington was built later, and Sally Gap is the scenic road between the two catchments. \nPubs: it's reckoned that Dublin has over 600. You can but make a start. \nIn 2021 you might pay \u20ac6 for a pint, glass of wine or measure of spirits, somewhat more in Temple Bar. Pubs are generally open Su-Th to 23:00 and F Sa to 01:00 or later. Hours were curtailed during covid, the plus (which will likely remain) was that pubs increased their food offering, which meant they were \"restaurants\" and permitted to stay open - \"You must try our pizza!\" became a legally enforceable invitation. Smoking is illegal within all Irish pubs but many have a beer garden or similar outdoor smoking area.\nTemple Bar was named for the sand bar and mud flats along the south bank of the Liffey, reclaimed for building in the 17th century. \"Temple\" was both the name of the landowners, and of the Temple Bar district in London, with Essex St and Fleet St in the same respective positions. It's nowadays a tourist strip of cobbled alleys, drinking places, restaurants, more drinking places, shops, even more drinking places . . . it's very central so those stag and hen parties are probably just in for a quick one before heading to the Book of Kells or the big museums. Take care, but the sheer number of people on the streets gives you a measure of safety. \n\n\n=== Traditional Irish ===\n Peadar Kearney's, 64 Dame St D02 RT72 (Temple Bar), \u260f +353 1 670 6457.

(updated Jun 2024)\n\n\n== Stay safe ==\nDublin is a safe city by day, but keep your wits about you, especially as night draws on. The emergency number for all services is 999 or 112.\nTraffic: the city is congested, avoid bringing a car yourself, and never leave valuables on display in a car.\nMotorists often ignore pedestrian crossing lights. Maybe they're preoccupied with searching for a parking spot.\nStreet life: Buskers, drunks and down-and-outs are all part of the picaresque Dublin scene, and An B\u00e9al Bocht - \"the poor mouth\" - has a noble literary tradition. A polite \"sorry\" should see them off.\nGarda\u00ed (police officers) are happy to assist or give directions. If you fear for your safety and can't find or phone a Garda, head to the nearest shop, bar etc where you will be safe and can call. Pub doormen and bouncers will likewise call the police for you, they want to forestall trouble on their street.\nLGBTQ+ travellers: Dublin is usually not only safe but welcoming, however 2022 saw a 29% increase nationwide in hate crimes against LGBTQ+ people. Each Garda station has a Diversity Officer on duty, and the police are vigilant against all forms of hate crime. Support can also be obtained from Outhouse LGBTQ+ Centre on Capel Street, tel +353 1 873 4999.\nRough areas: Boardwalk, Lower Abbey Street and around Connolly station are tacky rather than unsafe by day, worth a swerve at night.\nYou have simply no reason to be in down-at-heel outlying districts such as Ballymun.\n\n\n== Cope ==\n\n\n=== Medical ===\nYou should only go to the hospital if you're too ill to get there, so to speak. For immediate treatment of minor ailments try one of the Walk-in Medical Centres. The most central are Dame Street Medical at 16 Dame St in Temple Bar, Abbey Street Centre at 71 Middle Abbey St, and 24Doc at North Wall behind the Customs House. They're private so an EHIC / GHIC card won't help. Expect to pay \u20ac60 for a consultation, plus the cost of any prescription or other treatment.\n\n\n=== Embassies ===\n  Argentina, 15 Ailesbury Drive, Ballsbridge D04 KF50, \u260f +353 1 269 1546.

Those listed here are all within an hour of the city. \n\nCounty Dublin:\n- Dun Laoghaire is the city's former harbour, and Dalkey is a prosperous seaside suburb with Riveria architecture.\n- Howth is a scenic peninsula. Boat trips sail to Ireland's Eye, teeming with bird life.\n- Malahide has a fine castle.

        "title": "Paris",
        "extract": "Paris, the cosmopolitan capital of France, has the reputation of being the most beautiful and romantic of all cities, brimming with historic associations and remaining vastly influential in the realms of culture, art, fashion, food and design.\nDubbed the City of Light (la ville lumi\u00e8re) and the City of Love (la ville de l'amour), Paris is home to some of the world's finest and most luxurious fashion designers and cosmetics, such as Chanel, Christian Dior, Yves Saint-Laurent, Guerlain, Lanc\u00f4me, L'Or\u00e9al, and Clarins. A large part of the city, including the banks of the River Seine, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The city has the second highest number of Michelin-starred restaurants in the world (after Tokyo, which is much larger) and contains numerous iconic landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower, the Arc de Triomphe, Notre-Dame de Paris, the Louvre, the Moulin Rouge and the Basilique du Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur, making it one of the most popular international tourist destinations in the world, with around 14 million visitors annually. \n\n\n== Districts ==\nThe city of Paris is divided into 20 districts called arrondissements, numbered from 1 to 20 in a clockwise spiral from the centre of the city (which is known as Kilom\u00e8tre z\u00e9ro and is located at the front of Notre Dame). Arrondissements are named according to their number. You might, for example, stay in the \"5th\", which would be written as 5e in French. The 12th and 16th arrondissements include large parks: the Bois de Vincennes and the Bois de Boulogne respectively.\nThe very best map you can get for Paris is called \"Paris Pratique par Arrondissement\" which you can buy for about \u20ac5 at any news stand. It makes navigating the city easy. The various tourist information centres and hotels in Paris also provide various city and metro maps for free and which contain all the essential details for a tourist.\nEach arrondissement has its own unique character and selection of attractions for the traveller:\n\n \n \n \n\nBeyond Paris, the outlying suburbs are called La Banlieue. Schematically, those to the west of Paris (Neuilly-sur-Seine, Boulogne-Billancourt, Saint Cloud, Levallois, Versailles, Poissy, Rueil-Malmaison) are wealthy residential communities, even if some more middle class suburbs can be found. Those to the north are poorer communities, and very ethnically diverse. Those to the south are a mix of rough and poor neighbourhoods alongside very affluent communities. Finally, those to the east are usually lower-middle class mingled with a few upper-middle class communities.\n\n\n== Understand ==\nParis sits on the River Seine, in north-central France. Around 2.2 million people live in the city of Paris, but this only represents the urban core within the Boulevard P\u00e9riph\u00e9rique. There are some 10 million in the wider M\u00e9tropole du Grand Paris (814 km2) and almost 13 million people living in the metropolitan area, making this one of Europe's largest.\nDue to high expectations, a tight schedule, language barriers and large crowds and long lines at certain attractions during high season, the city might disappoint some visitors. Foreign visitors who have an idealized view of Paris might be shocked by the typical challenges of visiting any large city; crime, traffic noise, pollution, garbage, and relatively high costs. In the worst case, visitors might experience the Paris syndrome; a psychological state of delusion.\nTo enjoy the wonders of Paris, make realistic plans. The amounts of attractions and landmarks is overwhelming; visiting only the most famous ones (which can be overcrowded during major holidays) takes more than a week. The city also has more to offer for people who take time for a calm stroll along the backstreets. If your time in the city is short, be selective, and save some attractions for your next visit.\n\n Paris je t'aime. The website of the tourist office.

The City of Paris welcome centre also has an exhibition and shop. (updated Jan 2024)\n\n\n=== History ===\nParis started life as the Celto-Roman settlement of Lutetia on the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9, the island in the Seine now occupied by the Cath\u00e9drale de Notre Dame. It takes its present name from the name of the dominant Gallo-Celtic tribe in the region, the Parisii. At least that's what the Romans called them, when they showed up in 52 BCE and established their city Lutetia on the left bank of the Seine, in what is now called the \"Latin Quarter\" in the 5th arrondissement.\nThe Romans held out here for as long as anywhere else in the Western Empire, but by 508 CE they were gone, replaced by Clovis of the Franks, who is considered by the French to have been their first king. Clovis' descendants, aka the Carolingians, held onto the expanded Lutetian state for nearly 500 years through Viking raids and other calamities, which finally resulted in a forced move by most of the population back to the islands which had been the centre of the original Celtic village. The Capetian Duke of Paris was voted to succeed the last of the Carolingians as King of France, ensuring the city a premier position in the medieval world. Over the next several centuries Paris expanded onto the right bank into what was and is still called le Marais (The Marsh). Quite a few buildings from this time can be seen in the 4th arrondissement.\nThe medieval period also witnessed the founding of the Sorbonne. As the \"University of Paris\", it became one of the most important centres for learning in Europe\u2014if not the whole world, for several hundred years. Most of the institutions that still constitute the University are found in the 5th, and 13th arrondissements.\nIn the late 18th century, there was a period of political and social upheaval in France and Europe, during which the French governmental structure, previously a monarchy with feudal privileges for the aristocracy and Catholic clergy, underwent radical change to forms based on Enlightenment principles of nationalism, citizenship, and inalienable rights. Notable events during and following the revolution were the storming of the Bastille (in what is now the 4th arrondissement), and the rise and fall of Napoleonic France. Out of the violent turmoil that was the French Revolution, sparked by the still known Passion des Fran\u00e7ais, emerged the enlightened modern day France.\nThe Paris of today was built long after the Capetian and later the Bourbon Kings of France made their mark on Paris with the Louvre and the Palais Royal, both in the 1st. In the 19th century, Baron von Hausmann set about reconstructing the city, by adding the long straight avenues and replacing many of the then existing medieval houses, with grander and more uniform buildings.\n\nNew wonders arrived during La Belle \u00c9poque, as the Parisian golden age of the late 19th century is known. Gustave Eiffel's famous tower, the first metro lines, most of the parks, and the streetlights (which are partly believed to have given the city its epithet \"the city of light\") all come from this period. Another source of the epithet comes from Ville Lumi\u00e8re, a reference not only to the revolutionary electrical lighting system implemented in the streets of Paris, but also to the prominence and aura of Enlightenment the city gained in that era.\nThe twentieth century was hard on Paris, but thankfully not as hard as it could have been. Both world wars took a heavy toll on the city's inhabitants, but at least Hitler's order to burn the city was ignored by the German General von Choltitz, who was quite possibly convinced by a Swedish diplomat that it would be better to surrender and be remembered as the saviour of Paris, rather than its destroyer. Following the war, the city recovered quickly at first, but slowed in the 1970s and 1980s when Paris began to experience some of the problems faced by big cities everywhere: pollution, housing shortages, and occasionally failed experiments in urban renewal.\nHowever, post-war Paris enjoyed considerable growth as a multi-cultural city, with new immigrants from all corners of the world, especially La Francophonie, including most of northern and western Africa as well as Indochina. These immigrants brought their foods and music, both of which are of prime interest for many travellers. Immigration and multi-culturalism continues in the 21st century with a marked increase in the arrival of people from Latin America, especially Mexico, Colombia, and Brazil. In the late 1990s, it was hard to find good Mexican food in Paris, whereas today there are dozens of possibilities from lowly taquerias in the outer arrondissements to nice sit-down restaurants on the boulevards. \nNevertheless, Paris remains a French city; bistros, baguettes, high-end fashion, art, accordions, Hausmann architecture, and all the stereotypes (whether good or bad) of France are alive and well in Paris. People from all over France flock to Paris for work, study, partying, and everything in between. After all, this IS the capital of France, so anything pertaining to France can be found here.\nThe 21st century has also seen vast improvements in the general livability of Paris, with the mayor's office concentrating on reducing pollution and improving facilities for soft forms of transportation including a huge network of cycle paths, larger pedestrian districts and new metro lines. Visitors who normally arrive car-less are the beneficiaries of these policies as much as the Parisians themselves, although tensions and doubts have emerged over the actual benefits of those measures.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nParis has an oceanic climate with moderately cold winters and warm summers. The moderating effect of the Atlantic Ocean helps to temper temperature extremes in much of western Europe, including France. Even in January, the coldest month, temperatures nearly always exceed the freezing point with an average high of 7 \u00b0C (45 \u00b0F). Snow is not common in Paris, although it can fall a few times per year. Most of Paris' precipitation comes in the form of light rain year-round. Daylight hours run from 08:45 until 16:45.\nSummers in Paris are moderately warm and humid, with an average high of 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F) during the mid-summer months. Occasional heat waves can push temperatures above 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) and rarely even reach 35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F). The sun is up from 06:00 until almost 22:00.\nSpring and fall are normally cool and wet.\n\n\n== Get in ==\n\n\n=== By plane ===\n\n\n==== Charles de Gaulle Airport ====\nMain article: Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport\n1 Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG IATA), is the primary airport. Colloquially known as Roissy Airport, it is north of the city and is used mainly for long haul flights. The airport consists of three terminals: Terminal 1, Terminal 2 and Terminal 3, connected by the CDGVAL people mover. It is connected to Paris by train, bus and taxi. See Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport for details.\nRER line B serves central Paris and is the fastest and most economical option for most travellers. Most trains will stop at each station along the way to Paris. Express trains with fewer stops are available during off-peak hours. Gare du Nord, Ch\u00e2telet-Les Halles, Saint-Michel Notre-Dame, Luxembourg, Port-Royal, Denfert-Rochereau and Cit\u00e9 Universitaire are always served. A full-fare single ticket is \u20ac13 and trains run every 10 minutes. Your ticket will allow you to transfer to the Metro and other RER lines to complete your journey.\nRoissyBus coach services depart from all terminals and travel non-stop to Op\u00e9ra (Metro lines 3, 7, and 8 and RER line A) in central Paris. A full-fare single ticket is \u20ac13 and buses run every 15 min during the day and every 20 min in the evening. Journey time is typically 60 minutes, but can take longer in heavy traffic.\nIf you arrive at night you'll need a Noctilien bus to get to the city centre. The buses you'll need are N140 or N143. The buses leave every 30 min after 00:30.\nThis map shows you how you connect from the airport to the city.\n\n\n==== Orly Airport ====\nMain article: Paris Orly Airport\n2 Paris Orly Airport (ORY IATA), is the secondary airport. It is south of the city and is used mainly by Air France for domestic departures, and for several international departures, mostly towards destinations around the Mediterranean. The airport consists of four terminals: Terminal 1, Terminal 2, Terminal 3 and Terminal 4, connected by the Orlyval people mover. It is connected to Paris by metro, train, tram, bus and taxi. See Paris Orly Airport for details.\nMetro line 14 serves central Paris and is the fastest and most economical option for most travellers. A full-fare single ticket is \u20ac13 and trains run every 5 minutes. Your ticket will allow you to transfer to the RER and other Metro lines to complete your journey.\nOrlyval people mover runs from the airport to Antony for onward connections to the city via RER line B. A full-fare single ticket is \u20ac13 and people movers run every 6 min. Journey time from the airport to Antony is 6 minutes.\nTram line T7 runs from the airport to La Fraternelle for onward connections to the city via RER line C. A full-fare single ticket is only \u20ac2 and trams run every 10 min. Journey time from the airport to La Fraternelle is 8 minutes.\nIf you arrive at night you'll need a Noctilien bus to get to the city centre. The buses you'll need are N22, N31, N131 or N144. The buses leave every 60 min after 00:30.\nThis map shows you how you connect from the airport to the city.\n\n\n==== Beauvais\u2013Till\u00e9 Airport ====\n3 Beauvais\u2013Till\u00e9 Airport (BVA IATA). 85 km (53 mi) northwest of central Paris, this airport is used by some low-cost carriers such as Ryanair and WizzAir. The airport operates a shuttle service to the M\u00e9tro at Porte Maillot station. Buses run as early as 06:00. Buses leave 20 min after each flight arrives, and a few hours before each flight departs. A schedule can be found on the Beauvais Airport website. The journey will take about an hour in good traffic conditions, and costs \u20ac16.9 each way (Online) or \u20ac18 each way (Physically); there is no reduced price for children over the age of 2 years. Unless you hire a car this is the most realistic way to head toward Paris. The alternative is a train service between Gare du Nord and Beauvais, and a connecting shuttle or taxi to the airport. This journey costs more and takes longer. Missing the shuttle bus could mean a taxi fare well over \u20ac100.\n\n\n==== Ch\u00e2lons Vatry Airport ====\n4 Ch\u00e2lons Vatry Airport (XCR  IATA).  147 km (91 mi) east of central Paris. 105 km (65 mi) east of Disneyland Paris. Isolated.\n\n\n==== Le Bourget Airport ====\n5 Paris Le Bourget Airport (LBG IATA). 11 km northeast of central Paris. A 24-hour airport for private jets and business aviation. Companies like Air Charter Advisors and Priority Jet offer access to a variety of aircraft rentals.\n\n\n=== By train ===\n\nSee also: Rail travel in France\nParis is well connected to the rest of Europe by train. There are seven terminus stations in central Paris and although they are not all in the same district, they are all connected to the Metro and RER networks. You will probably want to know in advance at which station your train is arriving, so as to better choose a hotel and plan for transport within the city.\n\n6 Gare du Nord , (10th), M\u00e9tro: Gare du Nord \u2014 TGV trains to and from northern France (Lille, Amiens, Lens...), Thalys trains to Belgium, the Netherlands, and Germany (North Rhine-Westphalia), and Eurostar to the United Kingdom (London).\n7 Gare d'Austerlitz , (13th), M\u00e9tro: Gare d'Austerlitz \u2014 regular trains to and from the center and southwest of France (Orl\u00e9ans, Limoges, Toulouse the long way) and the majority of night trains.\n8 Gare de l'Est , (10th), M\u00e9tro: Gare de l'Est \u2014 TGV to and from the Grand Est region (Strasbourg, Reims, Nancy, etc.), Luxembourg, ICE/TGV to and from south Germany (Saarbr\u00fccken, Kaiserslautern, Mannheim, Frankfurt, Karlsruhe, Stuttgart, Augsburg, and Munich), \u00d6BB Nightjet night trains to Germany (Karlsruhe, Munich) and Austria (Salzburg, Vienna)\n9 Gare de Lyon , (12th), M\u00e9tro: Gare de Lyon \u2014 regular and TGV trains to and from southern and eastern France: French Alps, Marseille, Lyon, Dijon, Switzerland (Basel, Geneva, Lausanne, Bern, Zurich), southwest Germany (Freiburg im Breisgau), Italy (Turin, Milan) and Spain (Girona, Barcelona).\n10 Gare de Bercy , (12th), M\u00e9tro: Bercy \u2014 regular trains from Auvergne and Burgundy.\n11 Gare St Lazare , (8th) M\u00e9tro: St-Lazare \u2014 trains from Basse-Normandie, Haute-Normandie.\n12 Gare Montparnasse , (15th), M\u00e9tro: Montparnasse-Bienven\u00fce \u2014 TGV and regular trains from the west and south-west of France (Tours, Brest, Rennes, Nantes, Bordeaux, Toulouse the fastest way, Hendaye). Gare Vaugirard is an extension of Gare Montparnasse.\nThe SNCF (French national railway authority) operates practically all trains within France excluding the Eurostar to London, the Thalys to Brussels and onward to the Netherlands and Germany, and some low-cost services such as Ouigo (although owned by the SNCF, it is considered as a separate brand). There are also a few local lines of high interest to tourists which are privately owned. All SNCF, Eurostar and Thalys tickets can be bought in railway stations, city offices and travel agencies (no surcharge). SNCF relies on travel agencies for selling tickets online, the main one being SNCF Connect and Trainline (easier to use). You can also find tickets in online and physical travel agencies. You can book and buy tickets up to three months in advance. There are significant discounts if you book weeks ahead. Reduced ticket prices are different for each day and each train and can be used only on the train the reservation is for. Trains between Paris and south Germany (Frankfurt, Stuttgart, Munich) as well as the Marseille-Frankfurt TGV are jointly operated by SNCF and Deutsche Bahn, but each of the two operators will sell tickets at its own price! Make sure to check the price offered by each operator before you buy, or use Trainline since they automatically compare SNCF and DB prices.\n\nSee also: Rail travel in Europe\nThere are a number of different kinds of high-speed and normal trains:\n\nTER: The regional trains (Train Express R\u00e9gional); cheapest tickets, though prices are variable on the time of day of departure (and the day of departure as well). TER are sometimes slower, stopping at almost all stations. TER tickets bought at the train station are valid two months from the date indicated on the ticket, as long as you travel in the right fare period (\"p\u00e9riode bleue\", the cheapest, \"p\u00e9riode blanche\", for high-demand hours). There is no seat reservation, so arrive early enough or you may have to travel without a seat.\nIntercit\u00e9s: A bundling of the former Intercit\u00e9s, T\u00e9oz, and Lun\u00e9a train categories. There are two kinds: the regular trains, which are priced the same as the TER and the trains you'll find yourself on if you have a Eurail or InterRail pass and don't want to pay extra for reservations, and the trains \u00e0 r\u00e9servation obligatoire, which require a reservation and are priced differently from the regular Intercit\u00e9s trains.\nIntercit\u00e9s de nuit: Overnight trains from destinations to and from south of France, including Latour-de-Carol, Lourdes and Cerb\u00e8re via Toulouse.\nTGV: The world-famous French high-speed trains (Trains \u00e0 Grande Vitesse) run very frequently to the southeast Nice (5-6 hr), Marseille (3 hr) and Avignon (2.5 hr), the east Geneva (3hr) or Lausanne, Switzerland, Dijon (1 hr 15 min) and Strasbourg (1 hr 45 min), the southwest Bordeaux (3 hr), the west Rennes (2 hr) and the north Lille (1 hr). Thalys to Brussels (1 hr 20 min) use almost identical trains. Reservations are obligatory.\nICE: German high-speed trains, operating most services between Paris and Frankfurt.\nThalys: A high-speed train service running daily to/from the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany. Though it can be a bit expensive compared to normal trains, tickets can be cheap enough if you buy in advance. On-board service is usually very good.\nEurostar: The Eurostar service connects Paris with London St. Pancras directly and Brussels indirectly, as well as many other destinations indirectly through the various west European rail services. Travel time between Paris Gare du Nord and London St Pancras International averages 2hr 15 min. Eurail and InterRail passes are not valid for this train, though pass holders can benefit from a reduced price. You must arrive at the station at least 90 minutes, and up to two hours, before the departure of the train to complete security and passport controls.\nOuigo: A subsidiary of SNCF running TGVs with a second class only layout intended and marketed as a lower-cost service. Strict baggage limits and 30-minute check in times make them more like budget airlines.\nTrenitalia: Operates high-speed Frecciarossa trains between Paris, Lyon, Chamb\u00e9ry, Modane, Turin, and Milan. Prices can be cheaper than SNCF, Trainline automatically compares both options.\n\n\n===== From Gare d'Austerlitz =====\nGare d'Austerlitz \u2013 Gare de Bercy (15 min): Bus 24 to \u00c9cole V\u00e9t\u00e9rinaire de Maisons-Alfort.\nGare d'Austerlitz \u2013 Gare de l'Est (20 min):  5 , direction Bobigny.\nGare d'Austerlitz \u2013 Gare Montparnasse (25 min):  10  direction Boulogne, change at Od\u00e9on for  4  direction Mairie de Montrouge.

Companies that serve Paris are:\n\n13 Blablacar Bus (OUIBUS), 48 bis Boulevard de Bercy, 75012 Paris (Next to Gare de Bercy at the southside). A subsidiary of the SNCF, offering routes between Paris and London, Brussels, Amsterdam, Milan, Turin, along with other cities and towns in France. (updated Mar 2022)\n14 Flixbus (Next to Quai de Bercy, access through the Parc de Bercy.), \u260f +49 30 300 137 300, service@flixbus.com. Originally a German company, they serve many routes in and out of Paris, both domestic and international with destinations in Germany, Belgium or even London. Note that although their main hub is Bercy Seine, some buses also go to other places in Paris. (updated Feb 2019)\n15 Regiojet, bus stop along Rue du Faubourg near Ch\u00e2teau-Landon Metro stop (Next Gare de l'Est), \u260f +420 222 222 221, info@regiojet.com. A Czech company, offers connections to Paris from Prague and via Prague from Berlin and other cities. Good service and economical. (updated Jul 2018)\n\n\n=== By car ===\nSeveral autoroutes (expressway, motorway) link Paris with the rest of France:  and  to the north,  and  to the south,  to the east and  and  to the west. Not surprisingly, traffic jams are significantly worse during French school holidays.\nThe multi-lane highway around Paris, called the P\u00e9riph\u00e9rique (BP), is probably preferable to driving through the center. Another beltway nearing completion; L'A86 (also  and A286) loops around Paris about 10 km further out from the P\u00e9riph\u00e9rique. A third, incomplete beltway is much further out and called La Francilienne (N104).\nIt is advised not to drive within Paris and to be wary in the metropolitan area. It is better to drive to a suburban train station with a parking lot and then use the train to continue your trip throughout Paris. Most of Paris' roads were created long before the invention of automobiles. Traffic inside the city tends to be heavy, especially at rush hour; driving, however, may be rather easy and efficient in the evening. Parking is also difficult. Furthermore, the medieval nature of parts of the city's street system makes it very confusing, and traffic will almost never allow one to stop or slow down to get one's bearings. If you are unfamiliar with the streets and still insist on driving in the city, make sure you have a navigator in the passenger seat with you. However, Paris does have several iconic boulevards that have multiple lanes, form the backbone of the city\u2019s road network, and are useful if you do choose to bring a car \u2014 and are tourist attractions onto themselves.\nIn Paris, there are many car rental agencies offering a large number and wide range of vehicles for rental. Additionally, there are numerous car rental agencies located off-site which provide free airport transfers from their location and may offer lower prices well.\n\n\n== Get around ==\n\n\n=== By public transport ===\nParis has an excellent public transport system that spans every inch of the city. It is well-known for its M\u00e9tro (short for Chemin de fer m\u00e9tropolitain, \"Metropolitan Railway\"), RER (short for R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional, \"Regional Express Network,\"), and Transilien rail networks. The M\u00e9tro, RER and  Transilien are complemented by a large network of trams and buses.\n\u00cele-de-France Mobilit\u00e9s is the authority that controls and coordinates the different transport companies operating in the \u00cele-de-France region, including Paris. The website and app can be used to plan journeys, track services, and purchase tickets.\nRATP operates the M\u00e9tro, trams, buses, and about half of the RER A and B. SNCF operates the rest of the RER, as well as the Transilien. Both companies take the same tickets, so the difference is of little interest for most people except in case of strikes. For example, RATP may strike without SNCF doing so or the other way around.\nThe M\u00e9tro and RER move staggering numbers of people into, out of, and around Paris (6.75 million people per day on average), and most of the time in reasonable comfort. However, certain lines are operating at or near capacity, sometimes being so full that you'll have to let one or two trains pass before being able to board. If you can help it, avoid M\u00e9tro lines 1, 4, and 13 and RER line A and B during rush hours as these are the most congested lines in the system.\nStrikes, breakdown and construction are regular occurrences on the Paris public transit system. Generally during a strike, the M\u00e9tro operates with reduced service and some RER lines may stop operating altogether. Visit the RATP or SNCF websites for information on which routes are affected. Beware that real-time traffic information and construction announcements are often available only on the French-language version.\n\n\n==== By M\u00e9tro ====\n\nLook for the M\u00e9tro stations, marked with a large \"M\" sign or with an old-styled sign saying \"M\u00e9tropolitain\".\nThere are 16 M\u00e9tro lines (lignes) (1-14, 3bis, and 7bis) on which trains travel all day at intervals of a few minutes. Trains usually come 2\u20133 minutes apart during rush hour and 5\u201310 minutes apart during other times, depending on the line. The service starts on each end of every line at 05:30, and the last metro arrives on each end at 01:15 (service ends an hour later on Friday and Saturday nights, and the day before a holiday), stopping at all stations on the line. Some lines have rare trains that terminate at an intermediate station; if that happens, get off the train with the rest of the crowd and board the next train on the same track or on the other side of the platform (the driver will usually make an announcement in French). Lines 7 and 13 have a fork, so if you take line 13 north of La Fourche or line 7 south of Maison Blanche, make sure to board the train for the correct destination which is indicated by a lit arrow on the sign in the middle of the platform and on colour-coded binders in each carriage. Times for trains can be seen on an electronic scroll board above the platform. Scheduled times for first and last trains are posted in each station on the centre sign. Generally, except for early and late hours, travellers should not worry about specific Metro train times; just get to your station and take the next train.\nThe lines are named according to the names of their terminal stations (the end of the line). If you ask the locals about directions, they will answer something like: take line number n towards \"end station _\", change at \"station _\", take the line nn towards \"end station _\" etc. The lines are also colour-coded.\nChanging metro lines might be difficult at times for visitors travelling to or from the airport or train stations with heavy luggage or those with impaired mobility, especially at major metro intersections. Moving from one platform to another generally involves walking up and down multiple flights of stairs. Very few stations have elevators (only the newest line 14 is wheelchair-accessible at all stations). Only the busiest ones have escalators. It might be a good idea to check out the bus routes and timings and see if one can find a convenient bus connection.\nEach station displays a detailed map of the surrounding area with a street list and the location of buildings (monuments, schools, places of worship, etc.,) as well as exits for that particular metro. Maps are located on the platform if the station has several exits or near the exit if there is only one exit.\nExcept for M\u00e9tro 1, 2, 4, 5, 9, 13, and 14, the doors will not open automatically. In such a case, there are handles or buttons located both inside and outside the train that you have to push or unlatch in order to open the door. Many locals may try to squeeze into the trains after the alarm has sounded to signal the closing of the doors. While one can occasionally pass through on lines with a driver, the automatic doors on M\u00e9tro 1 and 14 will continue to close despite the presence of a limb or article of clothing. It is strongly advised to wait for the second train than to chance being caught between the doors.\nSome larger stations have secondary entrances, where there is no ticket booth. These are labelled voyageurs munis de billets (passengers with tickets).\n\n\n==== By RER ====\nThere are five commuter train lines that cross Paris: RER A, B, C, D, and E. RER trains run at intervals varying from about 3 minutes (RER A) to 6 minutes (RER D), and stop at every station within Paris. Trains can run up to every 5 minutes during rush hour, and you will never have to wait for more than 1 hour between two trains, even on the least served lines in the evening or on the weekend.\nRER trains will stop at every station within Paris (zone 1), but may skip stations outside Paris, so if you're going to the suburbs make sure your RER stops where you need! Information about the stops to be made by the next incoming train is presented on a separate board also hanging from the ceiling.\nRER trains do not have publicly announced numbers unlike the rest of SNCF network; the four letter codes (COHI, ELAO, QYAN, VICK, etc.) take the role of the train numbers instead; the first letter indicates the station where the train terminates, and the other three indicate the route and stops. Each line has its own nomenclature. You can look up what these codes mean on information panels in the station, but the easiest and fastest way is often to check the information screens along the platforms.\n\n\n==== By Transilien ====\nThe rest of the regional train network, called \"Transilien\", departs from the main train stations (Lyon for line R, Est for line P, Nord for lines H and K, St-Lazare for lines J and L, Montparnasse for line N) and La D\u00e9fense (line U). Trains can run up to every 5 minutes during rush hour, and you will never have to wait for more than 1 hour between two trains, even on the least served lines in the evening or on the weekend. The Transilien is marginally less crowded than the RER and the Metro.\n\n\n==== By tram ====\nMost tourists will not encounter the trams as they run only on the outskirts of the city. Trams T3a & T3b go nearly three quarters of the way round the city at the edge. Tram line 7 connects Orly Airport with RER line C; it is cheap but not fast.\n\n\n==== By bus ====\nA bus ride is interesting if you want to see more of the city. All stops have a name and are clearly marked on the street. At complex intersections, stops usually have a map that lets you know where other lines stop and if applicable where to find a M\u00e9tro entrance. If more than one line stops, wave to the driver to let them know you want to board. All buses have a schematic map of the line on display with all stop names, bus connections and major street names. Electronic displays inside each bus tell riders its current position and what stops remain, but don't overly rely on them as they don't always work.\nSince the M\u00e9tro is primarily structured around a hub-and-spoke model, there are some journeys for which it can be quite inefficient. In these cases it is worth seeing if a direct bus route exists, despite the complexity of the bus network.\nNoctilien night buses run regularly through the central hub at Chatelet to outlying areas of greater Paris. There is also a circle line connecting the main train stations. It pays to know one's Noctilien route ahead of time in case one misses the last M\u00e9tro home. Women travellers should probably avoid taking the Noctilien on their own to destinations outside Paris.\n\n\n==== Fares ====\nA Navigo Travel Card is required to use public transport in Paris city and the wider \u00cele-de-France region. The card can be loaded with a variety of fares (e.g. 10 M\u00e9tro-Train-RER Tickets). It cannot be loaded with credit like other cards around the world (e.g. \u20ac50). The card needs to be validated at the start of a journey and when transferring to a new tram or bus. It does not need to be validated at the end of a journey unless required to exit a fare gate.\nThe following cards are available to obtain:\n\nThe following fares are available to load:\n\nPaper tickets were completely discontinued in 2025.\nTicket inspectors roam the network and show no mercy to tourists pleading ignorance. Travelling without a ticket will result in you being cited and forced to pay a fine on the spot. Inspections usually take place behind the turnstiles at major metro stations or during transfers.\n\n\n=== By boat ===\n\nThere are several excellent boat services which make use of the Seine. As well as providing easy, cheap transport to much of central Paris, excellent photo opportunities abound. You can buy a day or 3 day ticket and hop on and off the boat as needed. The boats take a circular route from the Eiffel Tower, down past the Louvre, Notre Dame, botanical gardens then back up the other bank past Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay.  Batobus offers a regular shuttle service between the main tourist sights (closed Jan); other companies such as the famous Bateaux Mouches offer sightseeing cruises.\n\n\n=== By taxi ===\n\nTaxis are comparatively cheap especially at night when there are no traffic jams to be expected. There are not as many as one would expect, and sometimes finding a taxi can be challenging. In the daytime, it is not always a good idea to take a taxi, as walking or taking the metro (See: M\u00e9tro) will often be faster. If you know you will need one to get to the airport, or to a meeting, it is wise to book ahead by phone.\nThe initial fare is \u20ac2.40 and the meter increases by around \u20ac1.10 each kilometer and around 50 cents each minute spent at red lights or in traffic jams. Fares are fixed by the city law and every driver complies with them. Fares vary according to the day of the week, the hour of the day and the area you're crossing. If you call a taxi, the meter starts when you call and not when you get in. You should expect a \u20ac5 to \u20ac10 fare on the meter when the taxi arrives after you call it.\nRemember if a taxi is near a 'taxi station', they're not supposed to pick you up except at the station where there may be people waiting for a taxi. Taxi stations are usually near train stations, big hotels, hospitals, and large crossings.\nThere are a number of services by which you can call for taxis or make a reservation in advance. The two largest fleet are Taxis G7 and Taxis Bleus:\n\n Taxis G7, \u260f +33 1 47 39 47 39. \n Taxis Bleus, \u260f +33 891 70 10 10. \nAs in many other cities a taxi can be difficult to stop; you may have to try several times. When you do get a taxi to stop, the driver will usually roll down his window to ask you where you want to go. If the driver can't (or doesn't want to) go where you want, he might tell you that he's near the end of his work day & can't possibly get you where you want before he has to go off-duty.\nThere is a \u20ac6.40 minimum (2012) on all taxi rides, mandated by city law, but the meter does not show this amount, which can result in being asked to pay more than the metered amount on short rides. In Paris taxis are required by law to charge for the trip with a meter, charging a flat rate is illegal, except from/to Charles de Gaulle airport (\u20ac50 from the right bank of the Seine, \u20ac55 from the left bank) and Orly airport (\u20ac35 from the right bank, \u20ac30 from the left bank). Frequently the taxi driver will not want to drive you all the way to the doorstep, but will prefer to let you out a block or so away if there are one or more one-way streets to contend with. Try to look at this as a cost-savings rather than an inconvenience. You should pay while still seated in the cab as in New York and not through the front window London style. A tip is included in the fare price; If you're especially satisfied with the service, you can give something (basically 10%), but you don't have to. There is an extra charge for baggage handling.\nThe driver will not let you sit in the front seat (unless there are 3 or 4 of you, which is a rare case usually expedited by more money). Taxi-drivers come in all types, some nice, some rude, some wanting to chat, some not. Smoking in taxis is generally not allowed, however it might be that the taxi driver himself wants a cigarette in which case the rule might become flexible. Many drivers prefer that you avoid using your cellphone during the ride; if you do have to, make an apologizing gesture & sound, and do make a short call.\nIf for any reason you wish to file a complaint about a Paris taxi, take note of the taxi's number on the sticker on the left hand backseat window. Beware of illegal taxis (see the Stay safe section).\n\n\n=== By car ===\nIn a word: don't. It is generally a very bad idea to rent a car to visit Paris. Traffic is very dense during the day, and parking is, on average, exceedingly difficult and expensive. This is especially true in areas surrounding points of interest, since many of these are in areas designed long before automobiles existed. A majority of Parisian households do not own cars, and many people who move to the city find themselves selling their cars within a month or two.\nThat said, driving may be an option for going to some sights in the suburbs such as Vaux-le-Vicomte castle or the castle and city at Fontainebleau, or for starting to other places in France. You may prefer to rent from a location outside Paris proper.\nTraffic rules in Paris are basically the same as elsewhere in France, with the exception of having to yield to incoming traffic on roundabouts. However, driving in dense traffic in Paris and suburbs during commute times, can be especially strenuous. Be prepared for traffic jams, cars changing lanes at short notice, and so on. Another issue is pedestrians, who tend to fearlessly jaywalk more in Paris than in other French cities. Be prepared for pedestrians crossing the street on red, and expect similar adventurous behaviour from cyclists. Remember that even if a pedestrian or cyclist crossed on red, if you hit him, you (in fact, your insurance) will have to bear civil responsibility for the damages, and possibly prosecution for failing to control your vehicle. Note that the speed limit in Paris is 30 km/h in almost every street, besides a few large avenues clearly marked as such. There are no stop signs in the city center.\nParis has several orbital roads. There is a series of boulevards named after Napoleonic-era generals (Boulevard Mass\u00e9na, Boulevard Ney, and so forth), and collectively referred to as boulevards des Mar\u00e9chaux. These are normal wide avenues, with traffic lights. Somewhat outside of these is the boulevard p\u00e9riph\u00e9rique, a controlled-access road with grade separation. The p\u00e9riph\u00e9rique int\u00e9rieur is the inner lanes (going clockwise), the p\u00e9riph\u00e9rique ext\u00e9rieur the outer lanes (going anti-clockwise). Despite the looks, the p\u00e9riph\u00e9rique is not an autoroute: the speed limit is 70 km/h and, very unusually, incoming traffic has the right of way, at least theoretically (presumably because, otherwise, nobody would be able to enter during rush hour).\n\n\n=== By chauffeur ===\nKnown as car services or livery cabs, these cars are not allowed to cruise the street or airports for fares. You need to book them before they can pick you up. They are flat rate rather than metered (ask for the fare before getting in), and there are two types of licence: the \"Grande Remise\" that allows the car & driver to pick-up & drop-off passengers anywhere in France, and the \"carte verte\" that allows pick-up & drop-off in the department or region where the company is based. The Grande Remise cars have a GR on their front plate. They provide more service than a normal cab.\n\nShared shuttle: You have to share the shuttle with other customers. They can be delayed since the shuttle needs to pick up other customers and perhaps drop them off before you, but they are cheaper than a private shuttle.\nPrivate shuttle: Will pick you up on-time and drop you off directly to the address specified in the booking.\n\n\n=== By motorcycle ===\nParis is an incredibly open city, with its many \"Grands Boulevards\" and monuments with large open spaces around make it a city perfect to be explored and viewed by scooter or motorbike. Be warned that scooter/motorbike is by far the mode of transportation with the most casualties in Paris: half of victims of a collision were riding one, although they only account for about 2% of the traffic. When you're riding a scooter or motorbike in Paris, even if you see others doing so, it is not allowed to \"lane-split\" between the rows of cars waiting in traffic. At the red lights, even though a lot of scooter and motorbike drivers do not respect it, don't forget to pay attention to the bike designated area: you are not allowed to use them, and doing so is equivalent to failing to respect the red light (\u20ac135 fine). Parking-wise there are plenty of deux roues (two wheel) parking spots all over the city. Again, even though you may see plenty of scooters or motorbikes parked on the sidewalk, it is forbidden to do so. The city of Paris has dramatically increased the number of vehicles fined every day (\u20ac35), some of them even being towed away (at your own expenses).\n\n Paris By Scooter, (Scooter always delivered to your hotel), \u260f +33 6 28 35 39 30, paris@parisbyscooter.com. 08:00-21:00.

(updated Apr 2017)\n\n\n=== By bicycle ===\n\nRenting a bike is a very good alternative over driving or using public transport and an excellent way to see the sights. Riding a bike anywhere in the city is far safer for the moderately experienced cyclists than almost any town or city in the United States. The French are very cognizant of cyclists, almost to a point of reverence. Paris hasn't always been the easiest place to get around by bike, but that is no longer the case. The city government has taken a number of steps in strong support of improving the safety and efficiency of the urban cyclist as well, in establishing some separated bike lanes, creating a bikesharing system, and allowing cyclists to share the ample bus lanes on most major boulevards. Paris also has many riverside paths which are perfect for cycling. The Paris bike network now counts over 150 km of either unique or shared lanes for the cyclist. In addition, the narrower, medieval side streets of the central arrondissements make for rather scenic and leisurely cycling, especially during off-hours of the day when traffic is lighter. Do remember to bring a good map, since there is no grid plan to speak of and almost all of the smaller streets are one-way.\n\nWhile the streets of Paris are generally fairly easy on novice cyclists, there are some streets in the city that should be avoided by those who do not have sufficient urban cycling experience. Rue de Rivoli, Place de la Bastille, and Place de la Nation are particularly hairy, especially during weekdays and the Saturday evening rush, and should not be navigated by anyone not confident in their ability to cycle in heavy traffic. Avenue des Champs-Elys\u00e9es, Place de l'\u00c9toile, and voie Georges Pompidou (the lower-level express lanes along the banks of the Seine) should be avoided at all times.\nParis has a bike share system known as V\u00e9lib', \u260f +33 1 76 49 12 34. In January 2018, the original V\u00e9lib' was replaced by a new system called V\u00e9lib' M\u00e9tropole, that encompasses an ever larger area than the previous one. At first there were some technical issues, but by the end of 2018 it seems like they were mostly resolved. Bikes include a screen showing eg. how long a bike has been rented. Some electric bikes are also available (for an extra fee). \u20ac5 per day, first half hour free. (updated Feb 2019) You can purchase the V\u00e9lib pass online. An app helps finding stations and available parking slots. Green V\u00e9lib bikes are normal bikes, blue V\u00e9libs are ebikes.\n\n\n=== By foot ===\nWalking in Paris is one of the great pleasures of visiting the City of Light. It is possible to cross the entire city in only a few hours, but only if you can somehow keep yourself from stopping at numerous caf\u00e9s and shops. In fact within a few years walking combined with biking and the Metro may be the only way to get around the very centre of Paris as plans develop to reduce access to cars in the city centre.\nThe smartest travellers take advantage of the walk-ability of this city, and stay above ground as much as possible. A metro ride of less than 2 stops is probably best avoided since walking will take about the same amount of time and you'll be able to see more of the city. That said, pay attention to the M\u00e9tro stations that you may pass by on your journey; the M\u00e9tro network is very dense within the city and the lines are virtually always located directly underneath major boulevards, so if you become lost it is easy to regain your bearings by walking along a major boulevard until you find a M\u00e9tro station.\nYou may have heard of the hazard of walking into dog droppings in Paris. The problem is now virtually nonexistent due to fines as high as \u20ac180 and extensive street cleaning operations.\nIt's always fun to experience the city by foot, and there are numerous walking tours around Paris, whether self-guided (with the help of a guidebook or online guide) or with a touring guide (booked through your travel agency or hotel). The city is best explored by foot, and some of the most marvelous memories you will have of Paris is walking through secret found places.\nPedestrian call buttons at crosswalks are activated by pressing the button underneath the call button box.\n\n\n== Talk ==\nFrench (fran\u00e7ais) is of course the country's official language. Any native French person will speak French and it helps if you can speak a bit of it. In the parts of the city that tourists frequent the most, the shopkeepers, information booth attendants, and other workers are likely to answer you in English, even if your French is advanced. These workers tend to deal with thousands of foreign-speaking tourists, and responding in English is often faster than repeating themselves in French. This is not the case for the rest of the city.\n\nFor most Parisians, English is something they had to study in school, and thus seems a bit of a chore. People helping you out in English are making an extra effort, sometimes a considerable one. Parisians younger than 40 are much more likely to be fluent in English. Immigrants, often working in service jobs, are less likely to speak English. If it's your first time in France you will have some problems understanding what people are saying, even with prior education in French. Unlike most language education tapes, real Parisians tend to speak fast, use slang, and swallow some letters.\nWhen attempting to speak French, do not be offended if people ask you to repeat, or seem not to understand you, as they are not acting out of snobbery. Keep your sense of humour, and if necessary, write down phrases or place names. And remember to speak slowly and clearly. Unless you have an advanced level and can at least sort of understand French movies, you should also assume that it will be difficult for people to understand what you are saying (imagine someone speaking English to you in an indiscernible accent).\nWhen in need of directions what you should do is this: find a younger person, or a person reading some book or magazine in English, who is obviously not in a hurry; say \"hello\" or \"bonjour\" (bon-zhor); start by asking if the person speaks English, \"Parlez-vous anglais?\" (Par-LAY voo on-glay?) even if the person can read something in English, speak slowly and clearly; write down place names if necessary. Smile a lot. Also, carry a map (preferably Paris par Arrondissement); given the complexity of Paris streets it is difficult to explain how to find any particular address in any language, no matter how well you speak it. If anything, the person may have an idea as to the place you are looking for, but may not know exactly where it may be, so the map always helps.\nOn the other hand, you will probably get the cold shoulder if you stop a random person in the m\u00e9tro, fail to greet them and say \"where is place X or street Y\".\nNow, if you speak French, remember two magic phrases: \"Excusez-moi de vous d\u00e9ranger\" [ex-kuh-zay mwuh duh voo day-rawn-ZHAY] (\"Sorry to bother you\") and \"Pourriez-vous m'aider?\" [por-EE-AY voo may-DAY] (\"Could you help me?\") especially in shops; politeness will work wonders.\nIt is considered polite to always say \"bonjour\" (during the day) or \"bonsoir\" (at night) to employees when entering any type of shop even if you have no intention of buying anything. Upon leaving you should say \"merci\" to thank the shopkeeper for allowing you to browse and say \"bonne journ\u00e9e\" (bun zhur-nay) or \"bonne soir\u00e9e\" (bun swa-ray) to wish them a good day or evening. \"Bonne nuit\" is only used when telling someone \"goodnight\" when going to bed.\nFinally, if you speak a language other than English or French, and your French is limited or non-existent, offer to speak your second language with the phrase \"Parlez-vous anglais ou XXXX?\" (Par-LAY voo on-glay oo XXXX?) as this shows that you are making an effort to speak somebody else's language as well as your own.\n\n\n== See ==\n\nThe listings below are just some highlights of things that you really should see if you can during your visit to Paris. Detailed information can be found on each individual district page (click on the name of the sight).\n\n\n=== Landmarks ===\n1 Eiffel Tower.

These include: The Eiffel Tower, Sainte-Chapelle, and the catacombs. To avoid lines, you should start your day by arriving at one of these sites at least 30 minutes before opening time. Otherwise, expect a wait of at least an hour. Most museums and galleries are closed on either Monday or Tuesday. Examples: the Louvre museum is closed on Tuesdays while the Orsay Museum is closed on Mondays. Be sure to check museum closing dates to avoid disappointment! Also, most ticket counters close 30-45 min before final closing.\nAll national museums are open free of charge on the first Sunday of the month. However, this may mean long lines and crowded exhibits. Keep away from Paris during Easter week due to crowding. People have to queue up at the Eiffel Tower for several hours even early in the morning. However, this wait can be greatly reduced, if fit, by walking the first two levels, then buying an elevator ticket to the top. Entry to the permanent exhibitions at city-run museums is free at all times (admission is charged for temporary exhibitions).\n\n\n=== Sightseeing passes ===\nOne of the best value and most convenient ways to see the sights of Paris is with the Paris Museum Pass, a pre-paid entry card that allows entry into over 70 museums and monuments around Paris (and the Palace of Versailles) and comes in 2-day (\u20ac62), 4-day (\u20ac77) and 6-day (\u20ac92) denominations (August 2024). These are consecutive days. The card allows you to jump lengthy queues, a big plus during tourist season when lines can be extensive, and is available from participating museums, tourist offices, FNAC branches and all the main M\u00e9tro and RER train stations. You will still need to pay to enter most special exhibitions. To avoid waiting in the first long queue to purchase the museum pass, stop to purchase your pass a day or more in advance after mid-day. The pass does not become active until your first museum or site visit when you write your start date. After that, the days covered are consecutive. Do not write your start date until you are certain you will use the pass that day and be careful to use the European date style as indicated on the card: day-month-year.\nAlso consider the ParisPass, a pre-paid entry card + queue jumping to 60 attractions including the Louvre, The Arc de Triomphe, as well as a river cruise which allows free metro & public transport travel.\n\n\n== Do ==\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n1 French Open (Roland Garros). One of the four tennis Grand Slam tournaments. It is scheduled for two weeks from the last Sunday in May. The event, on clay courts, features the world\u2019s top-ranked tennis players. \nFootball: 2 Paris Saint-Germain play soccer in Ligue 1, the top tier, and often win it. But don't head for the central district of Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s! PSG play at Parc des Princes Stadium in the 16th arrondissement south of Bois de Boulogne. The club name derives from Saint-Germain-en-Laye 20 km west.\nParis FC are the poor relations, playing in Ligue 2, at Stade Charl\u00e9ty on the peripherique in the 13th arrondissement.\n3  Stade de France (RER train D). France's national stadium has a capacity of 81,338, and hosts concerts and various events. Some football club teams sometimes play here when their home stadium is unavailable. \nRugby: two clubs play rugby union (15 a side) in Top 14, the French top tier. Racing play at La D\u00e9fense Arena (or U Arena) in Nanterre. Stade Fran\u00e7ais play big games at Stade de France and others at Stade Jean-Bouin, next to Parc de Princes the PSG soccer stadium.\n\n\n=== Events ===\nIt seems like there's almost always something happening in Paris, with the possible exceptions of the school holidays in August and February, when about half of Parisians are to be found not in Paris, but in the South of France or the Alps respectively. The busiest season is probably the fall, from a week or so after la rentr\u00e9e scolaire or \"back to school\" to around No\u00ebl (Christmas) theatres, cinemas and concert halls book their fullest schedule of the year.\nGood listings of current cultural events in Paris can be found in Pariscope or Officiel des spectacles, weekly magazines listing all concerts, art exhibitions, films, stage plays and museums. Available from all kiosks. Timeout is a good option for tourists, who don't speak French.\nEven so, there are a couple of annual events in the winter, starting with a furniture and interior decorating trade fair called Maison & Object in January.\nIn February le nouvel an chinois (Chinese New Year) is celebrated in Paris as it is in every city with a significant Chinese and Vietnamese population. There are parades in the 3rd and 4th arrondissements and especially in the Quartier Asiatique (Asian Quarter) in the 13th south of Place d'Italie. Also in February is the Six Nations Rugby Tournament which brings together France, England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales and Italy.\nThe International Agricultural Show (Salon Internationale de l'Agriculture) usually takes place over a week around the end of February/beginning of March at the Porte de Versailles exhibition centre. It is unmissable (not just for tourists but also French politicians wanting to appear in touch with rural France), and showcases large numbers of domestic animals as well as selling speciality food products from all over France and its former colonies in Africa. Particularly recommended are the food stalls from the overseas territories where you can try regional specialities that are hard to come by even in Metropolitan France, and they will often also have performances from folk musicians/dancers. It's usually advised to buy tickets in advance as the queues for entry can be long.\nThe first of two Fashion weeks occurs in March: Spring Fashion Week, giving designers a platform to present women's pr\u00eat-\u00e0-porter (ready to wear) collections for the following winter.\nIn June, Rendez-vous au Jardin is an open house for many Parisian gardens, giving you a chance to meet real Parisian gardeners and see their creations. The F\u00eate de la Musique celebrates the summer solstice (21 June) with this city-wide free musical knees-up. Finally on the 26th of June is the Gay Pride parade, featuring probably the most sincere participation by the mayor's office of any such parade on the globe.\nThe French national holiday Bastille Day on the 14th of July celebrates the storming of the infamous Bastille during the French Revolution. Paris hosts several spectacular events that day of which the best known is the Bastille Parade which is held on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es at 10:00 and broadcast to pretty much the rest of Europe by television. The entire street will be crowded with spectators so arrive early. The Bastille Day Fireworks is an exceptional treat for travellers lucky enough to be in town on Bastille Day. The Office du Tourisme et des Congress de Paris recommends gathering in or around the champ de Mars, the gardens of the Eiffel Tower.\nAlso in July, Cinema en Plein Air is the annual outdoor cinema event that takes place at the Parc de la Villette, in the 19th on Europe's largest inflatable screen. For most of the months of July and August, parts of both banks of the Seine are converted from expressway into an artificial beach for Paris Plages. Also in July the cycling race le Tour de France has a route that varies annually, however it always finishes on the last Sunday of July under the Arc de Triomphe.\nOn the last full weekend in August, a world-class music festival Rock en Seine draws international rock and pop stars to the Domaine national de Saint-Cloud, just west of Paris.\nDuring mid-September DJs and (usually young) fans from across Europe converge on Paris for five or six days of dancing etc. culminating in the Techno parade - a parade whose route traces roughly from Place de la Bastille to the Sorbonne, and around the same time the festival Jazz \u00e0 la Villette brings some of the biggest names in contemporary jazz from around the world.\nIn the beginning of autumn the vine harvest fest takes place. The most famous is the F\u00eate des Vendanges de Montmartre, a food festival around the vine harvest of the Montmartre vineyard.\nThe Nuit Blanche transforms most of central Paris into a moonlit theme-park for an artsy all-nighter on the first Saturday of October, and Fashion Week returns shortly thereafter showing off Women's Pr\u00eat-\u00e0-Porter collections for the following summer; as we've noted winter collections are presented in March.\nThe third Thursday in November marks the release of Le Beaujolais Nouveau and the beginning of the Christmas season. This evening, the Christmas lights are lit in a ceremony on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, often in the presence of hundreds (if not thousands) of people and many dignitaries, including the president of France.\nUnfortunately, there are no comprehensive event guides covering concerts, clubs, movies or special events. For theatre, movies and exhibitions pick up the Pariscope and L'officiel du Spectacle, available at newsstands for \u20ac0.40. For (especially smaller, alternative) concerts pick up LYLO, a small, free booklet available in some bars and at FNAC. There is no user-friendly online version of these guides.\n\n\n=== Photography ===\nParis is considered by many as the birthplace of photography, and while one may debate the correctness of this claim, there is no debate that Paris is today a photographer's dream. The French capital offers a spectacular array of photographic expositions and opportunities to the beginner and the pro alike. It has photogenic monuments (e.g., Arc de Triomphe, Eiffel Tower, the obelisk at Concorde, and countless others); architecture (e.g., the Louvre, Notre Dame, the Museum of the Arab World) and urban street scenes (e.g., in the Marais, Montmartre and Belleville). When you tire of taking your own photos, visit one of the many institutions dedicated to photography. At these and other institutions, you can learn the about the rich history of Paris as the place of important developments in photography (e.g., the Daguerrotype) and as the home of many of the trade's great artists (e.g., Robert Doisneau, Andr\u00e9 Kert\u00e9sz, Eugene Atget and Henri Cartier-Bresson).\n\n4 Maison Europ\u00e9ene de la Photographie (La MEP), 5/7 Rue de Fourcy (Metro Saint-Paul, Pont Marie). W-Su 11:00-20:00. Important center for contemporary photography with a large exposition area having three or four major expositions per year dedicated to contemporary photography. Housed in an updated h\u00f4tel particulier built in 1706. There is a large library, auditorium and caf\u00e9. Their archive houses over twenty thousand works of art. Admission is free every Wednesday from 17:00 to 20:00. Admission \u20ac9.  (updated Sep 2019)\nJeu de Paume, at the entrance of Tulerie Gardens, is one of the city's premier photography exhibition sites.\n Better Paris Photos, 32 Avenue de Suffren, \u260f +33 6 74 04 21 84, register@betterparisphotos.com. By appointment, tours last from 4 hours. Better Paris Photos offers instructional tours and workshops that combine hands-on learning of essential photographic techniques with guiding to, and commentary about, the most photogenic spots of Paris. Led by English-speaking photographers and instructors, these tours are open to all skill levels and interest. From \u20ac195/half day; \u20ac290/full day. \nParis Photo, one of the world's most important art fairs, takes place in the autumn.\n\n\n=== Movies ===\nThe Cin\u00e9mas of Paris are (or at least should be) the envy of the movie-going world. Of course, like anywhere else you can see big budget first-run films from France and elsewhere. That though, is just the start. During any given week there are at least half-a-dozen film festivals going on, at which you can see the entire works of a given actor or director. Meanwhile, there are some older cult films like say, What's new Pussycat or Casino Royal which you can enjoy pretty much any day you wish.\nMany non-French movies are subtitled (called \"version originale\" \"VO\" or \"VOstfr\" as opposed to \"VF\" for version fran\u00e7aise).\nThere are any number of ways to find out what's playing, but the most commonly used guide is Pariscope, which you can find at newsstands for \u20ac0.70. Meanwhile, there are innumerable online guides which have information on \"every\" cinema in Paris.\nThe Cinemath\u00e8que fran\u00e7aise and the Forum des Images are the two public film institutions that organize retrospectives, exhibitions and festivals.\n\n\n=== Theatres ===\nThe 5 Paris Opera, as well as its associated ballet company, the Paris Opera Ballet, are considered to be among the premier classical performance companies in the world.\nIf you are under 26, there is a flat rate of \u20ac10 for every private theatre of the town every Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday night. This fare does not apply to public theatres nor opera.\n\n\n=== With children ===\nParis M\u00f4mes is a Parisian cultural guide with children's activities and events that comes out several times a year.\nCit\u00e9 des enfants in the 19th, a museum for kids within the Cit\u00e9 des Sciences et de l'Industrie, is interactive, fun, and educational. There are two separate sections for the 3-5 set and the 5-12 set. The tots section has simple exhibits designed to be pushed, prodded, and poked. The section for older kids is more sophisticated with scientific experiments and TV studios. M\u00e9tro Porte de la Villete (7)\nJardin du Luxembourg in the 6th. It would be counted as a travesty not to take your under 10 year old to the Jardin du Luxembourg, long a favourite with Parisian children. With its world famous merry-go-round, a pond for sail boats, a puppet theater, pony rides, chess players, children's playground, it has something for every kid (with comfortable chairs for weary parents thrown in!). The marionettes du Luxembourg, the puppet theatre, stages classic French puppet shows in French but should be easy to understand. There are numerous places for a snack. RER Luxembourg (B) or M\u00e9tro Od\u00e9on (4, 10)\nParc des Buttes-Chaumont in the 19th. Buttes-Chaumont is great for those with children that like to run, climb, and explore. Built on the site of an abandoned quarry, the park is roughly bowl-shaped with a 30-meter-tall peak situated in the middle of a pond at the park's center. There are trails up the rock, caves, waterfalls, a suspension bridge, and a small stone gazebo on the top of the rock with a 360-degree view. There is also a puppet theater and a playground. M\u00e9tro Buttes-Chaumont (7bis), Botzaris (7bis), or Laumi\u00e8re (5)\nParc Zoologique in the 12th. This zoo is different because of a 236-foot artificial mountain bang in its center. Take elevators to the top and enjoy the view or watch the mountain goats do their stuff on the sides. Lions, tigers, and everything designed to delight kids can be found in the zoo if the mountain doesn't do it for your kids. RER/M\u00e9tro Gare d'Austerlitz (5, 10, C)\nThe Jardin d'Acclimatation in the 16th has a number of rides, including pint-sized roller coasters suitable for children as young as three years, as well as a mini-zoo and the estimable Mus\u00e9e en Herbe. M\u00e9tro Les Sablons (1)\nThe Parc Floral, in the Bois de Vincennes, has different themed playgrounds, ping pong tables and picnic areas. During winter the entrance is free.\n\n\n== Learn ==\n Alliance Fran\u00e7aise. One of the world's largest schools of French language, the Paris Alliance Fran\u00e7aise has a wide variety of courses for a visitor to choose from. \n Ecole FL.

The emphasis is more on speaking and listening rather than on writing and grammar. The school is spread over a number of locations around Place Victor Hugo in the 16e. (updated Jul 2024)\n Universit\u00e9 Paris IV. Offers 'scholastic' as well as 'university' courses for foreigners in French language and culture, which start at various times of year. \n American Graduate School in Paris, 101, boul Raspail, \u260f +33 1 47 20 00 94, info@ags.edu.

(updated Jun 2017)\nParis is the seat of other places to learn about a variety of topics.\n\n The American Library in Paris (5 min walking from the Eiffel Tower).

Visitors can purchase a day pass or other short term memberships. The Library has Wi-Fi and if you have your laptop then you can access the internet for no charge other than the day pass to use the library. It has excellent books, current issues of American magazines, and the occasional celebrity patron. \n\n\n==== Culinary ====\nHow better to get to know a culture than to learn the ins and outs of its native cuisine. After sampling your fair share of Macarons and Magret de Canard around Paris, you might enjoy taking an afternoon to learn how to make these delicacies yourself and take the recipes home with you. While there are many cooking schools around Paris, only a few offer classes in English.\n\n Le Foodist, 59 Rue du Cardinal Lemoine, Paris 75004, \u260f +33 6 71 70 95 22, contact@lefoodist.com.

Register online, classes last 2-4 hours. La Cuisine Paris is an English-friendly culinary school located in the heart of Paris, right on the Seine that offers expert teaching of the essential techniques of cuisine fran\u00e7aise. Led by an international group of English-speaking chefs all trained in classic French cooking, these classes are open to all skill levels and tastes. Prices range from \u20ac69 for a two-hour Macaron class to \u20ac160 for a 4 hour Market class. \n\n\n== Work ==\nWork in Paris, especially for non-EU/EEA/Swiss citizens, entails a very long and arduous process. Unless you possess one of a number of in-demand skills, it will almost certainly be necessary to obtain a job offer from an employer before arriving. Your employer, for their part, will have to have the offer approved by the relevant governmental authorities, as well. If you opt for unreported work, such as babysitting, you need not fret about going through the process to obtain a Carte de s\u00e9jour, i.e., a formal visitor's identity card. However, if you do choose a change in location, it is advisable to obtain a Carte de s\u00e9jour prior to finding any job whatsoever, as the process can be longer than expected. A Carte de s\u00e9jour is often necessary to open a bank account and the like, and by extension for accomplishing any number of other tasks involved in modern life, so unless you're very comfortable transacting everything in cash you should probably bite the bullet and keep things on the up-and-up.\nIf you go to Paris for a conference, there's a very good chance you'll end up in a meeting or exhibiting at CNIT (Centre of New Industries and Technology). This conference and convention space is one of the oldest buildings in the La Defense area of Paris and still looks modern even though it's been eclipsed in height by surrounding buildings and hotels near the CNIT are mainly catered to those staying in the area on business.\nRemember, the city of Paris has a huge network of immigrants coming and going, and it is always great to tap into that network. The city holds a great abundance of work ready to be found, even if the search feels nerve-wracking at first.\n\n\n== Buy ==\nParis is one of the great fashion centres of the Western world, up there with New York, London, and Milan, making it a shopper's delight. While the Paris fashion scene is constantly evolving, the major shopping centres tend to be the same. High end couture can be found in the 8th arrondissement. In summer, there is nothing better than browsing the boutiques along Canal St-Martin, or strolling along the impressive arcades of the historic Palais-Royal, with beautifully wrapped purchases swinging on each arm.\nLe Marais is a mostly Jewish neighbourhood, most of the shops in Le Marais are open on Sundays. The stores in this area are intimate, boutique, \"Parisian\" style clothing stores. You will no doubt find something along each street, and it is always well worth the look.\nOther great areas to shop around in are around the area S\u00e8vres Babylone (M\u00e9tro Line 10 and Line 12). It is in this area you will find the Le Bon March\u00e9 7th, particularly rue de Cherche Midi 6th. The area boasts some of the major fashion houses (Chanel, Jean Paul Gaultier, Versace, etc.) and also has smaller private boutiques with handmade clothing.\nIn the Quartier Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s, you can find a handful of vintage clothing shops, carrying anything from couture early 20th century dresses, to 70s Chanel sunglasses. Walking along Boulevard Saint-Germain, you will find major brands. However, if in search of eclectic finds, opt to walk the northern side of the Boulevard, especially along rue Saint Andr\u00e9 des Arts, where you can always find a nice caf\u00e9 to stop in. The area south of Saint-Germain is just as nice, and comes with a price tag to match.\nIn the artsy quarters of 1 and 4, there are many bargains to be had, once again, if you are prepared to look. Souvenirs are easily found and can be fairly inexpensive as long as you don't buy from the tourist sites. For cheap books of French connection, try the University/Latin quarter as they sell books in all languages starting from half a euro each.\n\n\n=== Flea markets ===\nParis has 3 main flea markets, all on the outskirts of the central city. The most famous of these is the March\u00e9 aux Puces de St-Ouen (Porte de Clignancourt) (Clignancourt Flea Market), M\u00e9tro: Porte de Clignancourt, in the 18th, a haven for lovers of antiques, second-hand goods, and retro fashion. The best days to go are Saturday and Sunday. There are particular times of the week when only antique collectors are allowed into the stalls, and there are also times of the day when the stall owners take their Parisian siesta, and enjoy a leisurely cappuccino for an hour or so. The best times to visit the flea markets are in the spring and summertime, when the area is more vibrant. In and around the metro station, you may find the area a little wild, but still safe.\nThe March\u00e9 aux Puce de Vanves in the 14th arrondissement is open on Saturday and Sunday from 7h-14h. The closes metro station is Porte de Vanves.\n\n\n=== Musical instruments ===\nRue de Rome, situated near Gare St. Lazare, is crowded with luthiers, brass and woodwind makers, piano sellers, and sheet music stores. Subway station Europe. The area south of the metro station Pigalle is also packed with music shops (more oriented towards guitars and drums).\n\n\n=== Artwork ===\nFor art lovers, be sure to check out Quartier Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s, which is renowned for its galleries, and it is impossible to turn a street without finding a gallery to cast your glance in. On Fridays, most open until late. Most even have the benefit of bottles of wine so you can wander in with your glass of wine and feel very artistique. Great roads to walk along are rue de Seine, rue Jacob, rue des Beaux Arts, Rue Bonaparte, and Rue Mazarine.\nAlso, be sure to visit the historical district of Montparnasse and quartier Vavin where artists like Modigliani, Gauguin and Zadkine used to work.\n\n\n== Eat ==\nIndividual listings can be found in Paris's district articles\nParis is one of Europe's culinary centres, where the haute cuisine has flourished since at least the French revolution. It may however come as a surprise that Paris isn't considered the culinary capital of French cuisine; many people prefer the French cooking found in small rural restaurants, outside of the city, closer to the farms and with their focus on freshness and regional specialities. Even among French cities, Paris has long been considered by the French as second to Lyon for fine dining.\nThere have been other challenges in the last 20 years or so as restaurateurs in places like San Francisco and Sydney briefly surpassed their Parisian fore bearers, again with an emphasis on freshness of ingredients but also borrowings from other cuisines. Parisian cooks didn't just rest on their laurels during this time, rather they travelled, taught, and studied, and together with Paris's own immigrant communities, have revitalized the restaurant trade. Today you can find hundreds of beautiful restaurants with thoughtful (or just trendy) interior design and well-planned and executed cartes and menus offering a creative m\u00e9lange of French and exotic foreign cuisines. It's safe to say that Paris is once again catching up with or edging ahead of its Anglophone rivals.\nOf course there are also some traditional offerings, and for the budget conscious there are hundreds of traditional bistros, with their sidewalk terraces offering a choice of fairly simple (usually meat centred) meals for reasonable prices.\nIt is unfortunately possible to have a uniformly poor dining experience during a stay in Paris, probably because mass tourism attracts price gougers. It is frequent to hear people complaining of very high Parisian prices for very poor food and service. Since so many of the restaurants are sub-par, the best approach is to rely on a restaurant guide and personal recommendations. Do your research in advance if possible and be prepared to travel some distance. Don't just walk down the street expecting to find good food; you probably won't.\nMany restaurants are tiny and have tables close together - square metres are at a premium and understandably restaurateurs need to make the most of limited space. In some cases when the restaurant is crowded, you may have to sit beside strangers at the same table. If that does not appeal to you, go to a more upscale place where you will pay for the extra space.\nTrendy restaurants often require reservations weeks, if not months in advance. If you haven't planned far enough ahead, try to get a reservation for lunch which is generally easier and less expensive.\nFor an easy-to-manage eating budget while in Paris, consider: breakfast or \"petit d\u00e9jeuner\" at a restaurant, possibly in your hotel, consisting of some croissants, coffee, and maybe a piece of fruit. Get a 'walking lunch' from one of Paris' many food stands\u2014a panino in the centre of the city, a crepe from a crepe stand, a felafel pita or take-out Chinese in the Marais. Traiteurs serving Chinese and/or Vietnamese food are ubiquitous in the city and good for a cheap lunch and many p\u00e2tisseries sell inexpensive coffee and sandwiches. All these are cheap (about the same as breakfast), easy, and allow you to maximize your sightseeing and walking time while enjoying delicious local or ethnic food. For dinner, stroll the streets at dusk and consider a \u20ac20-40 prix-fixe menu. This will get you 3 or 4 courses, possibly with wine, and an unhurried, candlelit, magical evening. If you alternate days like this with low-budget, self-guided eating (picnicking, snacking, street food) you will be satisfied without breaking the bank.\nIf one of the aims of your trip to Paris is to indulge in its fine dining, though, the most cost-effective way to do this is to make the main meal of your day lunch. Virtually all restaurants offer a good prix-fixe deal. By complementing this with a bakery breakfast and a light self-catered dinner, you will be able to experience the best of Parisian food and still stick to a budget.\n\n\n=== Self-catering ===\nBudget travellers will be very pleased with the range and quality of products on offer at the open air markets (e.g. the biggest one on Boulevard Richard Lenoir (near the Bastille), Rue Mouffetard, Place Buci, Place de la Madeleine and over the Canal Saint-Martin in the 11th or in any other arrondissement). If your accommodation has cooking facilities you're set, especially for wine and cheese, a decent bottle of French wine will set you back all of about \u20ac3-5, while the fairly good stuff starts at around \u20ac7. Bottles for less than \u20ac3 are not recommended.\nThe small \u00e9piceries which open until late are more expensive than the supermarch\u00e9s (Casino, Monoprix, Franprix, etc.) For wine, the price difference can be up to \u20ac2.\nBuy a baguette, some cheese and a good bottle of wine and join the Parisian youth for a pique-nique along the Seine (especially on the \u00cele Saint-Louis) or along the Canal Saint-Martin. The finest food stores are Lafayette Gourmet in the Galeries Lafayette or La Grande Epicerie in the luxury department store Le Bon March\u00e9. They are worth discovering. You will find a large variety of wines there, otherwise try wine stores (cavistes) that are present everywhere in the city, and sell all kind of good French wine that you won't find in a supermarket. The owners usually know their wines and will be happy to help you choose among their huge selection. Some also sell good food. You can search for one online or ask a local. There are also some \"wine supermarkets\" such as Nicolas or Le Relais de Bacchus (all over the city) that sell more common wines.\n\n\n=== Some specialities ===\nFor seafood lovers, Paris is a great place to try moules frites (steamed mussels and French fries) (better in fall and winter), oysters, sea snails, and other delicacies. Meat specialties include venison (deer), boar, and other game (especially in the fall and winter hunting season), as well as French favourites such as lamb, veal, beef, and pork.\n\n\n=== Prices ===\nEating out in Paris can be expensive. However don't believe people when they say you can't do Paris on the cheap - you can! The key is to stay away from the beaten tracks and the obviously expensive Champs Elys\u00e9es. Around the lesser visited quarters especially, there are many cheap and yummy restaurants to be found. The area around Fontaine Saint-Michel, the fountain facing Notre Dame is crowded by particularly tasty places to eat, with good ambiance, cheap prices and excellent service, with the advantage of being very centric of many places of interest. The key is to order from the prix-fixe menu, and not off the A la Carte menu unless you want to pay an arm and a leg. In many places a three course meal can be found for about \u20ac15. This way you can sample the food cheaply and is usually more \"French\". Ask for \"une carafe d'eau\" (oon karaaf doe) to get free tap water.\n\n\n=== Kosher dining ===\nParis has the largest number of Kosher restaurants in any European city. Walk up and down Rue des Rosiers to see the variety and choices available from Israeli, Sushi, Italian and others. You will also find a wide assortment of Kosher restaurants in the 9th arrondissement of Paris near the rue Richer and rue Cadet areas. See the district guides for examples. Kosher restaurants and snacks usually display a big orange rectangle on their front, which ensure clients that they are Beth din certified.\n\n\n=== Vegetarian dining ===\nFor vegetarians, eating traditional French food will require some improvisation, as it is heavily meat-based. That being said, it is far easier to be vegetarian in Paris than it is elsewhere in France. Paris has several excellent vegetarian restaurants, and many non-vegetarian restaurants will provide vegetarian dishes. \nWhen eating in a traditional restaurant, be careful before ordering dishes labelled as \"vegetarian\". Many French people presume that fish and seafood are vegetarian dishes. This is a widely spread misunderstanding all around the country. Additionally, French people tend to confuse \"real\" vegetarians with vegans. When explaining that you're a vegetarian that won't eat fish, people will often presume that you don't eat milk or egg-based products.\nLook for spots such as Le Grenier de Notre-Dame in the 5th. The 10th arrondissement also has quite a large variety of vegetarian restaurants, especially of Indian and East/South-East Asian fare. See the arrondissement pages for more listings. For fast food and snacks, you can always find a vegetarian sandwich or pizza, or indeed French tacos. Even a kebab shop can make you something with just cheese and salad, or perhaps falafel. And for healthier fare, it's not usually hard nowadays to find hipstery places that sell vegan poke bowls.\nThere are also lots of Italian, Thai, Indian, and Mezo-American places where you will have little problem. The famous South Indian chain Saravana Bhavan have their branch near Gare Du Nord. In Rue des Rosiers (4th arrondissement) you can get delicious falafel in the many Jewish restaurants. Another place to look for falafel is on Rue Oberkampf (11th arrondissement). Take away falafel usually goes for \u20ac5 or less.\nMoroccan and Algerian cooking is common in Paris - vegetarian couscous is lovely. Another good option for vegetarians - are traiteurs, particularly around Ledru Rollin (down the road from Bastille) take away food where you can combine a range of different options such as pomme dauphinoise, dolmas, salads, vegetables, nice breads and cheeses and so on.\nLebanese restaurants and snack shops abound as well, offering a number of vegetarian mezze, or small plates. The stand-bys of course are hummas, falafel, and baba-ganouche (caviar d'aubergine). A good place to look for Lebanese is in the pedestrian zone around Les Halles and Beaubourg in the 1st and 4th.\nAlso look out for banh mi (Vietnamese sandwich) places, especially around Rue Mouffetard in the 5th, where you can often get a tofu banh mi for less than a fiver.\n\n\n=== Tourists and locals ===\nWhen you are looking for a restaurant in Paris, be wary of those where the staff speak English a bit too readily. These restaurants are usually geared towards tourists. It does make a difference in the staff's service and behaviour whether they expect you to return or not.\nSometimes the advertised fixed price tourist menus (\u20ac10-15) are a good deal. If you're interested in the really good and more authentic stuff (and if you have learned some words of French) try one of the small bistros where the French go during lunch time.\n\n\n== Drink ==\nThe bars scene in Paris really does have something for everyone. From bars which serve drinks in baby bottles, to ultra luxe clubs that require some name dropping, or card (black Amex) showing, and clubs where you can dance like no one's watching, (although they will be). To start your night out right, grab a drink or two in a ubiquitous dive bar, before burning up the dance floor and spreading some cash, at one of the trendy clubs.\n\nCanal St Martin. Many cozy caf\u00e9s and other drinking establishments abound around the Canal St Martin in the 10th.\nThe Marais. The Marais has a large number of trendier new bars mostly in the 4th and to a lesser extent the 3rd with a few old charmers tossed into the mix. A number of bars and restaurants in the Marais have a decidedly gay crowd, but are usually perfectly friendly to straights as well. Some seem to be more specifically aimed at up-and-coming hetero singles.\nBastille. There is a very active nightlife zone just to the northeast of Place de Bastille centered around rue de Lappe, rue de la Roquette, rue du Faubourg Saint-Antoine (especially the amazing Club Barrio Latino) and rue de Charonne in the 11th. Many of the bars closest to Bastille have either a North, Central, or South American theme, with a couple of Aussie places mixed in for good measure, and as you continue up rue de Charonne the caf\u00e9s have more of a traditionally French but grungy feeling.\nQuartier Latin - Odeon. If you're looking for the nouvelle vague (new wave) style, student and intellectual atmosphere of Paris in the 1960s and 70s, you'll find a lot of that (and more hip and chic) places in the quartier Latin and between place Odeon and the Seine. The neighbourhood is also home of many small artsy cinemas showing non-mainstream films and classics (check 'Pariscope' or 'l'officiel du spectacle' at any newspaper stand for the weekly programme).\nRue Mouffetard and environs. The area in the 5th on the south side of the hill topped by the Panth\u00e9on has a little bit of everything for the nighthawk, from the classy caf\u00e9s of Place de la Contrescarpe to an Irish-American dive bar just down the way to a hip, nearly hidden jazz caf\u00e9 at the bottom of the hill.\nCh\u00e2telet. In some ways the Marais starts here in the 1st between Les Halles and H\u00f4tel de Ville but with between all of the tourists and the venerable Jazz clubs on rue des Lombards the area deserves some special attention.\nMontmartre. You'll find any number of cozy caf\u00e9s and other drinking establishments all around the Butte Montmartre in the 18th, especially check out rue des Abbesses near the M\u00e9tro station of the same name.\nOberkampf-M\u00e9nilmontant. If you are wondering where to find the hipsters (bobos for bohemian-bourgeois), then this is where to look. There are several clusters of grungy-hip bars all along rue Oberkampf in the 11th, and stretching well into the 20th up the hill on rue de M\u00e9nilmontant. It's almost like being in San Francisco's Haight-Fillmore district.\nBagnolet. There are a cluster of bar/restaurant/nightclubs along the southern end of the P\u00e8re Lachaise cemetery in the 20th including probably the best place in Paris for nightly local and touring punk rock.\nRues des Dames-Batignolles. Another good place to find the grungy-chic crowd is the northern end of the 17th around rue des Dames and rue des Batignolles, and if you decide you want something a little different Montmartre is just around the corner.\nPort de Tolbiac. This previously deserted stretch of the river Seine in the 13th was reborn as a center for nightlife (and Sunday-afternoon-life) a few years ago when an electronic music cooperative opened the Batofar. Nowadays there are a number of boats moored along the same quai, including a boat with a Caribbean theme, and one with an Indian restaurant.\nSaint Germain des Pr\u00e9s. This area has two of the most famous caf\u00e9s in the world: Caf\u00e9 de Flore and Les Deux Magots, both catering to the tourists and the snobs who can afford their high prices. This part of the 6th is where the Parisian caf\u00e9 scene really started, and there still are hundreds of places to pull up to a table, order a glass, and discuss Sartre deep into the evening.\nFor individual bar listings see the various Arrondissement pages under Drink.\nOf course there are lots of interesting places which are sort of off on their own outside of these clusters, including a few like the Hemingway Bar at the Ritz which are not to be missed in a serious roundup of Parisian drinking, so check out the listings even in those arrondissements we haven't mentioned above.\nSome nightclubs in Paris that are worth it: Folies Pigalle (pl. Pigalle, 18th, very trashy, \u20ac20), Rex Club (near one of the oldest cinemas on earth, the Grand Rex, house/electro, about \u20ac15). You might also want to try Cabaret (Palais Royal), Maison Blanche, le Baron (M Alma-Marceau). Remember when going out to dress to impress, you are in Paris! Torn clothing and sneakers are not accepted. The better you look, the more likely you will get past the random decisions of club bouncers. Also important to remember if male (or in a group of guys) that it will be more difficult to enter clubs; try to always have an equal male/female ratio.\n\n\n== Sleep ==\n\n\n=== Hotels ===\nBeing often declared the most popular travel destination in the world, Paris has far over a thousand hotels to choose from, and even more in the surrounding Ile-de-France region. The choice may be overwhelming, but should be made carefully. There are huge differences in standards and location is key to make your stay in Paris enjoyable and time used well. Be prepared to pay the price for Paris' popularity - even the cheap hotels are relatively expensive.\nDespite the popularity with tourists, global hotel chains have relatively low penetration of the Parisian market. A notable exception is the French-based Accor, which boasts over 300 hotels in the Paris area, although with large swathes of central Paris largely uncovered. There is a fair amount of Best Westerns as well, but most international chains limit their presence to very few exclusive (and expensive) hotels in key locations. Travellers loyal to a particular brand may find their loyalty challenged, be forced to pay for it (rather than be rewarded) or unable to find their hotel brand of choice in Paris.\nHotels in the central arrondissements tend to be expensive, although very cheap ones can also be found. With few exceptions, they tend to offer small rooms - be aware of the fact that the difference in price between hotels can translate into difference in service, facility and appointment levels, but not necessarily room size. Rooms of 12-16 square metres (which is roughly half of standard hotels rooms e.g. in the USA) are the norm in central Paris, regardless of hotel standards.\nCheaper hotels in popular arrondissements tend to be older, less attractive properties, whose facilities and appointments may be very worn and outdated, far behind standards one would expect from the capital of all things pretty and fine. Even updated and restored hotels may exhibit wide variance in standards between room categories, and keep some of the rooms not refurbished or only minimally touched up to be able to offer attractive, eye-catching pricing for them and then upsell to more comfortable room categories. Always check out latest reviews, preferably with photos, to precisely determine what to expect from a given hotel and given room category.\nHotels outside of the city centre, or even outside of the Peripherique and Paris itself, can be far cheaper and better value for money than ones in central Paris, while still having good transit links via metro or RER. That said, you should check thoroughly how far from the metro / RER station the given hotel is, and whether the connection to the POIs you want to visit is direct, quick and easy. Do also factor in the added cost of transportation to outer zones, as well as the time spent to travel to and from the city and obviously resulting limitations.\nBecause of local preferences, a bathtub in the bathroom is a norm in most hotels, even if it means squeezing it into a very small bathroom, further limiting space. If you prefer a walk-in shower, you need to look for a hotel that specifically offers those (called \"douche italienne\" by the French), and you should generally look at newer, purpose-built properties.\nParis hotels, almost without regard to category or price, observe high and low seasons. These differ slightly from one hotel to another, but usually the high season roughly corresponds to late spring and summer, and possibly a couple of weeks around the Christmas season.\nFor individual hotel listings see the various Arrondissement pages. \n\n\n=== Apartment rentals ===\nFor those staying for a week or more, renting a furnished apartment might be a more comfortable and money-saving option, especially for 3 or more adults. Furnished apartments can differ considerably in location and quality, offer different accommodations and selections of appliances and kitchen features, or may be well-above street level with no elevator. Expect apartment sizes to be modest. Access to local public transport can also vary widely. So choose carefully only after getting a full description of an interesting property.\nMany websites will help you find rentals. Some do a more disciplined job of locating and describing properties and their locale. Most charge a commission of 10% or more; some offer insurance covering some risks. Some may offer a few apartments for shorter stays, usually at somewhat higher cost per day.\nIn late-spring and summer months, desirable properties may be in short supply. If your plans are fairly firm for those periods, you would be wise to \"reserve\" a unit well in-advance. Owners will often ask for a non-refundable deposit of up to 50% of the total cost of your stay. Means of payment can range from money order to PayPal or (occasionally) charge card. (Take great care of how and with whom you share any charge card account number.) You should send no payment to any post office box or similarly anonymous place or account...even after exchanging e-mails with a purported owner; most are no more than \"blind\" scams to take your money.\nThe city government has passed ordinances that require owners renting properties for short periods to collect a tax previously collected only by hotels. This substantial tax may not be collected by some owners, or may be demanded by them but not mentioned in their rates until you arrive. Tax enforcement and collection remain in a state of flux.\nSome agencies, rental brokers or web sites, that seem amicable, attractive or claim reputations, do not abide by French law to carefully vet and select landlords and apartments they offer for rent. There are a certain number of guarantees, which are required in France before renting an apartment, and an insurance policy, which aims at protecting the tenants during their stay.\n\n\n== Stay safe ==\n\n\n=== Crime ===\nDespite what many naysayers might say or believe, Paris is still a relatively safe city. This does not stop it from being plagued by petty crime, especially pickpocketing, and muggings. Scams, of which there are many, are also prevalent, though the police are slowly cracking down on them. While not common, purse snatchings do happen. Violent crime is rare. However, watch yourself at ATMs and other places where your cash may be visible. Keep your money and your wallet in your front pockets, and avoid ATMs that are open to the outside, especially at night.\nAs a densely populated city with equally dense neighbourhoods, one would be remiss to generalise the safety of entire 'arrondissements' based on a few specific areas. Several arrondissements have their share of crime, however. The 18th, 19th, and 20th arrondissements are widely seen as the least safe areas of Paris, but safety levels vary dramatically from street to street. During the day, they're usually fine; you might have to watch out for pickpockets and scammers, but not much more. However, be on your guard at night. The 10th arrondissement (namely the areas bordering the 18th and 19th arrondissements) and the southeastern portion of the \"p\u00e9riph\u00e9rique\" have also gained a reputation for being sketchy.\nSeveral of the inner suburbs of the metropolitan area (commonly referred to as the banlieues) such as La Courneuve, Saint-Denis, Sarcelles, and Pantin are notoriously 'rough' by European standards, and you should be cautious when visiting these places. Unrest in those areas has made global headline news (as did the somewhat heavy-handed reactions of various French governments).\nThe police can be reached by phone by dialling 17. Not all police officers speak English, but those found around touristy areas almost always will. They are usually friendly and perfectly approachable should you have to.\n\n\n==== Theft in public transit ====\nThe m\u00e9tro and RER are also a popular place for pickpockets. Hold things tightly and be aware of your surroundings. While trains are usually crowded, if someone is insisting and hovers over you, they are probably going through your pockets. It is important to know that a majority of these belong to a gang. These gangs usually use young children as young as seven, with groups of them going around the metro stations pickpocketing tourists and locals alike. If there is a group of three or more suspicious looking people, be careful of your belongings. This is a notable occurrence on M\u00e9tro line 13, tramways, and the RER B.\nCommon tactics are two of them blocking you as you try to board the subway, with two behind you quickly going through your bag. Seconds before the doors close, the two jump off, leaving you on the metro without even realizing what has happened. Take note of what locals do. If someone warns you to be careful, there are probably some suspicious types hoping to steal from you. Also be aware that phone-snatching is the most reported crime, and avoid using your cellphone on metro platforms and in the metro itself.\nPickpockets are active on the rail link (RER B) from Charles de Gaulle airport to downtown Paris, which passes through the poor suburbs of Seine-Saint Denis. Try to take the trains which are nonstop between the airport and Paris proper (Gare du Nord) - EKLI/EKIL from Paris to CDG and KRIN/KROL from CDG to Paris. These are faster and are less crowded than the alternative.\nThere have also been problems with thieves physically fighting people in order to steal their belongings. The most common targets are those with suitcases and backpacks, i.e. tourists. Thieves usually coin their acts with the closing of the doors. Newer trains have cameras everywhere, and thieves are much less likely to use them. Otherwise, stow luggage on the racks above the seat (which is not possible in newer trains) and hold on to your bags so no one can grab them and then run out. You are much less likely of being a victim if the train is crowded with locals headed to work, usually at rush hour.\nThe train conductors are widely aware of these crimes and will usually wait a few seconds to leave the station after the doors have closed, just in case thieves have quickly jumped off with belongings. There are also emergency cords that one can pull if willing to chase after the attackers. People will usually be helpful and gladly call the police if you do not have a cell phone.\n\n\n==== Theft in tourist hotspots ====\nPickpockets are most likely to be found working at crowded tourists hotspots, so keep your wallet and phone in your front pockets and hold your backpack tightly when in a crowd.\nA common place for phone/camera/wallet snatching is in tourist friendly dining areas scattered all over Paris where exposed outdoor tables are commonly right on busy sidewalks. Common practice by many Western tourists is to leave an aforementioned item of value on the table (most commonly a smartphone) in front of them. Some of the criminals, working in groups of three to five people, approach your table and shove what appears to be a survey directly under your nose thus blocking your view of your valuable. While the gang members are yelling in a foreign language another one will slip a hand below your view and take your item of value from the table. This occurs very quickly (less than five seconds) and the perpetrators disappear around the corner just as quick as they arrived.\nKey landmarks like the Louvre or the Eiffel tower have been plagued with gangs of pickpockets, which typically operate in groups of about five. As many as half a dozen of these gangs may be active at a particularly famous, crowded venue at any one time; occasionally there are fights between rival gangs of thieves. Asian visitors are often targeted due to a presumption that they are visiting from affluent nations. Venue staff have complained of being spat at, threatened, abused or assaulted by pickpocketing gangs; the Louvre closed briefly in 2013 (as did the Eiffel tower in 2015) due to worker protests of unsafe conditions due to criminal activity. Token attempts to deploy more police have not solved the problems.\n\n\n==== Scams ====\n\nAt Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur, there are many men who will try to tie strings or bracelets on your finger (often called \"string muggers\"). Not only will they demand an obscene fee for the cheap trinkets (usually over \u20ac15), they will also try to pickpocket you or threaten you with force if you do not give them money. They are usually only at the base of the monument and can be avoided by taking the Funicular of Montmartre. Otherwise, you can quickly walk past them and ignore them, though they will readily grab people's arms and have even been known to target children of tourists. Yelling at them may cause unwanted attention and cause them to back off, but be careful. Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur appears to be the only area where they congregate, but they have been sighted also near the Eiffel Tower.\nBesides them, you will notice many people walking around with cheap trinkets at touristy areas, especially the Trocad\u00e9ro, Eiffel Tower, and Louvre Museum. They are generally not rude, but buying things from them is illegal and hurts small businesses. Of course, they bolt at the sight of the police, and you may end up in the middle of a stampede!\nBe careful around Barb\u00e8s-Rochechouart and the bars near Moulin Rouge. A very common clip joint trick is played here which might cost you up to \u20ac500. The agents standing outside will force you to enter a bar and just have a look for 5 minutes. The moment you order a drink (about \u20ac5), a girl will approach you and start talking generally, and leave in 10\u201315 minutes. After a harmless conversation with the girls when you request a bill, you will encounter a charge of say \u20ac200-500 as 'service fees' for the services rendered by the girl! In case you resist paying, the bouncers will start intimidating you to try to extract money from your wallet. In such cases, threaten them that you are calling the police and informing the local embassy. Try to buy some time and start creating a ruckus. However, do not try to start a fight with the bouncers. This trick is common to many European big cities.\nOne scam involves a \"helpful\" local buying a ticket for you. Normally, tourists buy 1-day, 3-day or longer Paris Visite passes. They would tell you that your single trip ticket has expired and bring you to the ticketing machine to purchase day passes. Then they would select the 3 day pass for adults (even though you may be a student) and deliberately show you the price on the screen. Everything else is in French so you would not understand a thing. They would proceed to purchase with a credit card and while entering the PIN code, get you to turn your back on them. They then sneakily change the ticket to a single trip ticket and ask for payment for a 3-day ticket from you. Unsuspecting tourists would pay the full sum thinking it is a 1-day or 3-day pass when it is only a useless ticket. Buy the tickets yourself to avoid situations like these, as machines are available in English and other languages. If you feel threatened, call the police and don't physically handle the ticket if they forcibly purchase without your agreement.\nAnother common scam is found along the banks of the Seine river and involves a ring. This involves thieves \"finding\" a ring which they give to you. They then ask you if you own it. When you say no, they insist you keep it, saying it goes against their religion or they cannot wear rings. A few moments later, they ask you for money to buy something to eat, eventually following you and becoming more annoying. You can either yell at them or steer them towards an area where there are likely to be police present, at which point they will quickly run away.\nThe most common scam (besides pickpocketing) that has taken over Paris by storm since June 2011 involves women coming up to tourists with pledge sheets. They pretend to be deaf people collecting money for one charity or another. Once you are distracted with the petition, an accomplice pickpockets you and takes your belongings. In addition, once you sign, they point to a thing that reads \"minimum ten euro donation.\" While they may at first insist on this, shaking your head and walking away will usually make them pester someone else. Otherwise, simply waving them off and a loud no should make them give up. If they are in a large group, as is common, be careful of your belongings! This is a ploy to pickpocket you as you are surrounded by them. At this point, yelling for the police will make them disperse quickly. This is most commonly found around major tourist sites, but has also been a problem at Gare du Nord, though this has gotten much better.\nNever bet money on a 3-card game as you will always lose. This trick is played by con artists on some of the bridges on River Seine near the Eiffel Tower.\nA more modern scam takes place on ride-sharing apps such as Bolt. The \"driver\" will send you a message, saying you need to provide your mobile number in order to \"confirm\" the booking (this is not true; no such rule exists). Once you have done so, they will then attempt to use your number to sign into an account on another app (such as Uber), and send you another message on the first app requesting your confirmation code (which you will have received in a text message from the second app after you gave out your number). They will use another made-up excuse (\"Uber now runs Bolt operations in Paris\") to talk you into doing this. If the scam is a success, they will have access your account, and can run up massive bills by booking rides in your name. As such, if you receive such a message, do not engage, just cancel the ride and report the driver as a scammer. The app should then refund your cancellation fee. \nIt is a good idea to steer clear of the suburb of Seine Saint-Denis, as this suburb is known for its gangs and poverty, though there is little of interest to tourists anyway (except the Basilique de Saint-Denis, but that is located near a m\u00e9tro station). You may want to avoid walking alone at night in the 18th and 19th arrondissements as well, as these can be a little shady at night. There is a large problem with youths from the depressed suburbs causing trouble with the police. If locals are moving away, it is most likely from a confrontation. While these groups rarely target people besides the police, be careful. Walk away from a situation that could lead to fights or worse.\nIn general, remember to be aware of pickpockets, as they act by trying to distract you. Avoid showing off expensive phones or a lot of money in public transportation or in open areas. Put your things in a money belt or your front pockets, but never in the back pockets.\n\n\n==== Danger for identifiably Jewish people ====\nParis has the largest Jewish community in Europe and the 6th largest in the world. However, antisemitic acts increased in France in the early 2000s, culminating with the January 2015 \u00cele-de-France attacks targeting a local kosher supermarket. Attacks on Jews have since decreased and as of 2023, there have been no recent reports of attacks against tourists of Jewish faith. After 2015, the French government assigned thousands of soldiers to guard synagogues and Jewish schools. Still, fearing harassment or attacks, many of the local Jews no longer wear a kippa/yarmulke in public. So consider taking the advice of local Jews regarding your behavior. For example, if you wear a kippa, consider wearing it under a hat that is not identifiably Jewish.\n\n\n== Respect ==\nParisians have a reputation for being egocentric, rude and arrogant. While this is often only an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along in Paris still is to be on your best behavior, acting like someone who is \"bien \u00e9lev\u00e9\" (well brought up). It will make getting about considerably easier.\nParisians' abrupt exteriors will rapidly evaporate if you display some basic courtesies. A simple \"Bonjour, Madame\" when entering a shop, for example, or \"Excusez-moi\" when trying to get someone's attention, are very important; say \"Pardon\" or better \"je suis d\u00e9sol\u00e9\" if you bump into someone accidentally or make other mistakes. If you speak French or are using a phrasebook remember to always use the vous form when addressing someone you don't know; this may transform the surliest shop assistant into a smiling helper or the grumpiest inhabitant to a helpful citizen. Courtesy is extremely important in France (where the worst insult is to call someone \"mal \u00e9lev\u00e9\", or \"badly brought up\").\nIf you only learn one long phrase in French a good one would be \"Excusez-moi de vous d\u00e9ranger, monsieur/madame, auriez-vous la gentillesse de m'aider?\" (pardon me for bothering you, sir/madam, would you have the kindness to help me?) - this level of extreme politeness is about the closest one can come to a magic wand for unlocking Parisian hospitality. If you know some French, try it! But remember, too, that Parisians have places to go and things to do, so if they have no time and don't answer you, don't take it personally. Many Parisians, given time, will go out of their way to help, especially if you make an effort to speak their language and act polite to them.\nMost foreigners tend to ignore basic rules of courtesy in metro and train transport in Paris. If the carriage is full and you're sitting on a folding seat, you should consider standing up. If you stand next to the door, you are expected to leave the train at a stop so that people inside can exit. Once they have got out, you can go back. However, don't always expect that others will do the same for you. When pushing a door in a station, you are expected to hold it for the next person, so that it won't close abruptly. This rule is strictly observed in the metro, and quite commonly everywhere else.\nIn addition, if you are traveling to or from the airport on the train and have luggage, do not block the aisles with your bags. The RER B (which links both Orly and Charles de Gaulle airports to the city) has luggage racks above the seats (on the newer trains, there are no such racks above the seats, but racks dedicated to luggage in between some seats); it is best to use them so you do not block the path of a local who is getting off the train before the airport stop. On the m\u00e9tro and especially on the RER, don't take up extra seats with your luggage. There are luggage racks and spaces between the seats.\nThere are hefty fines for littering in Paris, especially for dog poo (often you'll find free plastic bag dispensers around parks or playgrounds).\n\n\n== Connect ==\nAs of Sept 2021, Paris has 5G from all French carriers. WiFi is widely available in public places, public transport, cafes and so on.\nOne helpful thing about having official and numbered districts in Paris is that you can easily tell which arrondissement an address is in by its postal code, and can easily come up with the postal code for a Paris address if you know its arrondissement. The rule is just pre-pend 750 or 7500 to the front of the arrondissement number, with 75001 being the postal code for the 1st and 75011 being the postal code for the 11th, and so on. The 16th has two postal codes, 75016 for the portion south of Rue de Passy and 75116 to the north; all other arrondissements only have one postal code.\nPhone cards are available from most \"tabacs\" but make sure you know where you can use them when you buy them, as some places still sell the cartes cabines which are hard to use as cabines are rare.\n\n\n== Cope ==\nFamous for its status as \"fashion capital\", Paris isn't as conservative in dress as one might think. Parisians will tolerate all kinds of clothes as long as they're worn \"avec style\" (with style). That's why men do not usually wear shorts shorter than above the knee outside of sporting events: it is not considered indecent but may stand out from the locals; shorts are for \"schoolboys and football players\" only.\n\n\n=== Airlines ===\n Air France, 30 av L\u00e9on Gaumont 75985, \u260f +33 36 54. \n Air France Agence Op\u00e9ra, 49 av Op\u00e9ra 75002, \u260f +33 36 54. \n Air France Agence Jardin du Luxembourg, 4 pl Edmond Rostand 75006, \u260f +33 36 54. \n Air Tahiti Nui, 28 bd St Germain 75005, \u260f +33 825 02 42 02. \n Croatia Airlines, Roissyp\u00f4le Le D\u00f4me B\u00e2t1 r de la Haye Tremblay en France BP 18913 95731 ROISSY CH DE GAULLE CEDEX, \u260f +33 1 48 16 40 00. \n Delta Air Lines, 2 r Robert Esnault Pelterie 75007, \u260f +33 892 702 609. \n Finnair (Compagnie A\u00e9rienne de Finlande), Roissy Terminal 2D 95715 ROISSY CDG CEDEX, \u260f +33 821 025 111. \n LOT Polish Airlines, 27 r Quatre Septembre 75002, \u260f +33 800 10 12 24. open daily. \n Qatar Airways, 7 r Vignon 75008, \u260f +33 1 55 27 80 80. \n Royal Jordanian airlines, 38 avenue des Champs Elysees Paris - 75008, fax: +33 1 42 65 99 02, partorj@rj.com. \n Royal Air Maroc, 38 av Op\u00e9ra 75002, \u260f +33 820 821 821. \n Royal Brunei Airlines, 4 r Fbg Montmartre 75009, \u260f +33 826 95 31 21. \u00b4\n Ryanair, A\u00e9roport Beauvais - Till\u00e9, \u260f +33 892 68 20 64. \n Saudi Arabian Airlines (Lignes A\u00e9riennes de l'Arabie Saoudite), 34 av George V 75008, \u260f +33 820 20 05 05. \n Singapore Airlines, 43 r Boissi\u00e8re 75116, \u260f +33 821 230 380. \n Srilankan Airlines, 113 r R\u00e9aumur 75002, \u260f +33 1 42 97 43 44. \n Syrian Arab Airlines, 1 r Auber 75009, \u260f +33 1 47 42 11 06. \n TAM Airlines, 50 Ter r Malte 75011, \u260f +33 1 53 75 20 00. \n TAP Portugal, \u260f +33 820 319 320. \n Turkish Airlines, 8 Place de l\u2019Opera 75009, \u260f +33 1 56 69 44 90, fax: +33 1 45 63 10 80, direction.paris@turkishairlines.fr. 09:30-17:30. \n Vietnam Airlines, 49 Avenue des Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es 75008, \u260f +33 1 44 55 39 90. \n\n\n=== Embassies ===\n 1 Australia, 4, rue Jean Rey, 75015 Paris, \u260f +33 1 40 59 33 00, fax: +33 1 40 59 33 10.   \n 2 Austria, 6, rue Fabert 75007 Paris / consular office at 17, avenue de Villars, 75007 Paris, \u260f +33 1 40 63 30 63, +33 1 40 63 30 90 (consular office), fax: +33 1 45 55 63 65, paris-ob@bmeia.gv.at.  \n 3 Algeria, 50, rue de Lisbonne 75008, \u260f +33 1 53932020.

        "extract": "Tokyo can be broadly divided into the \"23 special wards\", \"Tama region\" and \"Islands\". This article is about the 23 special wards of Tokyo, which corresponds to what many think of as the \"city of Tokyo\". For information on Tokyo as a prefecture, Tama region and Islands, see Tokyo Metropolis.\n\nTokyo (\u6771\u4eac T\u014dky\u014d) is the enormous and wealthy capital of Japan, and its main city, overflowing with culture, commerce, and most of all, people. As the most populated urban area in the world, Tokyo is a fascinating and dynamic metropolis that mixes foreign influences, consumer culture and global business along with remnants of the capital of old Japan. From modern electronics and gleaming skyscrapers to cherry blossoms and the Imperial Palace, this city represents the entire sweep of Japanese history and culture. Tokyo truly has something for every traveller.\n\n\n== Districts ==\nThe capital of Japan is not a city, but is actually Tokyo Metropolis (\u6771\u4eac\u90fd T\u014dky\u014d-to), which apart from the name is indistinguishable from a prefecture: it's equal in status with the other 46 prefectures, and is about as big (containing large suburban and even rural areas to the west, as well as islands as far as 1,000 km (620 mi) south). Even more strangely, there is no such thing as the \"city of Tokyo\". What most people, both foreigners and Japanese, are thinking of when they hear \"Tokyo\" is the special wards of Tokyo (\u7279\u5225\u533a tokubetsu-ku), sometimes just called the 23 wards (23\u533a nij\u016bsan-ku). They're somewhat like the boroughs of London or New York, except there's no \"city government\" banding them together. The wards refer to themselves as \"cities\" in English (since they behave as such, each having its own mayor and council), but to avoid confusion, most people prefer to call them \"wards\".\nThis article is about the 23 special wards, while the western suburbs and the islands are covered in Tokyo Metropolis.\nThe geography of central Tokyo is defined by the JR Yamanote Line (see Get around). The center of Tokyo \u2014 the former area reserved for the Shogun and his samurai \u2014 lies within the loop, while the Edo-era oldtown (\u4e0b\u753a shitamachi) is to the north and east. Sprawling around in all directions and blending in seamlessly are Yokohama, Kawasaki and Chiba, Tokyo's suburbs. Together, the entire metropolitan area has a population of over 40 million, making it the most populated urban area in the world.\n\n\n=== Central Tokyo ===\n\n \n \n\n\n=== Old Tokyo (Shitamachi) ===\n\n\n=== Suburbs ===\n\n \n \n\n\n== Understand ==\nOver 500 years old, the city of Tokyo was once the modest fishing village of Edo (\u6c5f\u6238 - literally Gate of the River) due to its location at the mouth of Sumida-gawa. The city only truly began to grow when it became the seat of the Tokugawa Shogunate in 1603, who decided to set up a new seat of power far away from the intrigues of the imperial court in Kyoto. After the Tokugawa Shogunate collapsed in the Meiji Restoration of 1868, the emperor and the imperial family moved here from Kyoto, and the city was renamed to its current name, Tokyo, literally the \"Eastern Capital\". The metropolitan center of the country, Tokyo is the destination for business, education, modern culture, and government. (That's not to say that rivals such as Osaka won't dispute those claims.)\n\n\n=== Culture ===\n\nTokyo is vast: it's best thought of not as a single city, but a constellation of cities that have grown together. Tokyo's districts vary wildly by character, from the electronic blare of Akihabara to the Imperial gardens and shrines of Chiyoda, from the hyperactive youth culture hub of Shibuya to the pottery shops and temple markets of Asakusa. If you don't like what you see, hop on the train and head to the next station, and you will find something entirely different.\nThe sheer size and frenetic pace of Tokyo can intimidate the first-time visitor. Much of the city is a jungle of concrete and wires, with a mass of neon and blaring loudspeakers. At rush hour, crowds jostle in packed trains and masses of humanity sweep through enormous and bewilderingly complex stations. Don't get too hung up on ticking tourist sights off your list: for most visitors, the biggest part of the Tokyo experience is just wandering around at random and absorbing the vibe, poking your head into shops selling weird and wonderful things, sampling restaurants where you can't recognize a single thing on the menu (or on your plate), and finding unexpected oases of calm in the tranquil grounds of a neighbourhood Shinto shrine. It's all perfectly safe, and the locals will go to sometimes extraordinary lengths to help you if you just ask.\n\n\n=== Expenses ===\n\nThe cost of living in Tokyo is not as astronomical as it once was. Deflation and market pressures have helped to make costs in Tokyo comparable to most other large cities in the developed world. Visitors from San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, London, Paris, Sydney, Toronto and Dublin will not find it any more expensive than back home. Rent will be significantly cheaper than big Western cities like NYC, London, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. Travelers should budget a similar amount of money for their stay in Tokyo as they would for any other great city in Europe, North America or Australia. Locals will know the bargains, but experienced cheapskates from anywhere in the world can get by with a little ingenuity. Tokyo is one of the most popular places to live in Japan. Rent for a single's apartment could range from US$500 to US$1,000 a month. Tokyo is so overwhelmingly crowded that many people live in apartments no bigger than 16 square meters (175 square feet). That being said, with excellent transportation throughout Tokyo and its outskirts, living five minutes further away from central Tokyo could mean hundreds of dollars less for living expenses each month or allow for larger housing. Many parts of Chiba, Saitama, Kanagawa, or even Ibaraki prefectures may allow the feeling of \"living in Tokyo\". Still, nothing compares to Tokyo itself in regards to waking up and stepping outside instantly into metropolitan life.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTokyo is classified as lying in the humid subtropical climate zone and has five distinct seasons.\n\nSpring kicks off with plum blossoms in late February, followed by the famous cherry blossoms (sakura) in March\u2013April. Parks, most famously Ueno, fill up with blue tarps and sozzled salarymen.\nRainy season (baiu or tsuyu) in late May to June means a month of overcast skies and drizzle punctuated with downpours, with temperatures in the twenties.\nSummer really kicks off in July, with clear skies and brutal steam bath humidity. Daytime maximums tend to average around 31 \u00b0C (88 \u00b0F) with some days around 34 \u00b0C (93 \u00b0F) or higher, but the humidity can make those temperatures feel like 34 \u00b0C (93 \u00b0F) and 41 \u00b0C (106 \u00b0F), respectively. Overnight lows average around 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F) with some nights at 27 \u00b0C (81 \u00b0F) or higher, but even those temperatures given the humidity can feel like 26 \u00b0C (79 \u00b0F) and 31 \u00b0C (88 \u00b0F). A short walk outside will leave you drenched in sweat, so this is probably the worst time of year to visit, and is best avoided if you have a choice. The one bright spot is the plethora of fireworks, most notably the epic pyrotechnic extravaganza of the Sumidagawa Fireworks Festival on the fourth Saturday in July. Sunrises occur before 04:30, and sunset is always before 19:00, save for a week in late June.\nFall from September onwards means cooler temperatures and fall colors. While southern Japan is regularly battered by typhoons this time of year, they mostly (but not always) veer clear of Tokyo.\nWinter is usually mild, with temperatures generally ranging from 0-10 \u00b0C, though occasional cold spells can send temperatures plummeting below zero at night, and indoor heating can leave much to be desired. Snow is rare, but on those rare occasions once every few years when Tokyo is hit by a snowstorm, much of the train network grinds to a halt. Sunsets occur before 16:30 in December, and sunrise is always before 07:00.\nTokyo is hotter than surrounding areas due to the urban heat island.\n\n\n=== Visitor information ===\nGO>TOKYO is a  well-maintained sightseeing guide site for foreigners by the government. The site includes a search page for restaurants with multi-language menus.\n\n\n== Talk ==\nIt's possible for English speakers to navigate their way around Tokyo without speaking any Japanese. Signs at subway and train stations include the station names in romaji (Romanized characters), and larger stations often have signs in Chinese and Korean as well. Though most people under the age of 40 have learned English in school, proficiency is generally poor, and most locals would not know more than a few basic words and phrases. Some restaurants may have English menus, but it does not necessarily mean that the staff will speak much English. Reading and writing comes much better though; many people can understand a great deal of written English despite not being able to speak it. That being said, staff at the main hotels and tourist attractions generally speak a decent level of English. While it is possible to get by with only English, it will nevertheless make your trip much smoother if you can learn some basic Japanese.\n\n\n== Get in ==\nIn Japan, all roads, rails, shipping lanes and planes lead to Tokyo.\n\n\n=== By plane ===\nTokyo (TYO  IATA for all airports) and the Kanto Region are served by two major airports. Narita International Airport (NRT IATA) is Tokyo's main airport for international flights, but also serves a handful of domestic flights, particularly on low-cost carriers, and is convenient as a transit airport for those travelling between North America to most major East and Southeast Asian cities. Tokyo Haneda Airport (HND IATA), which is much closer to central Tokyo and thus much more convenient and economical for getting into Tokyo and vicinity, is the main airport for domestic flights, but has also become a major hub for international flights as of the 2020s, particularly on routes that see heavy business traffic. There is also Ibaraki Airport (IBR IATA) for some low-cost carriers, and the Ch\u014dfu Airfield, serving turboprop flights to the Izu Islands.\n\n1 Narita International Airport (NRT IATA; \u6210\u7530\u56fd\u969b\u7a7a\u6e2f Narita Kokusai K\u016bk\u014d). Near the town of Narita nearly 70 km (43 mi) east of Tokyo. Serves most international flights into Tokyo as well as limited domestic flights, primarily on low-cost carriers.   \n2 Tokyo Haneda Airport (HND IATA; \u7fbd\u7530\u7a7a\u6e2f Haneda K\u016bk\u014d or \u6771\u4eac\u56fd\u969b\u7a7a\u6e2f T\u014dky\u014d Kokusai K\u016bk\u014d). The busiest airport in Japan and second busiest in Asia, located in \u014cta ward, 14 km (8.7 mi) south of central Tokyo. Serves most domestic flights, and expansions since 2010 have also turned it into a major international hub, primarily on routes with heavy business traffic.   \n3 Ibaraki Airport (IBR IATA; \u8328\u57ce\u7a7a\u6e2f) (85 km and 1\u00bd hr north of Tokyo). Skymark operates domestic flights to Sapporo, Kobe, Fukuoka and Okinawa. Spring Airlines operates service to Shanghai and Tigerair flies to Taipei.   (updated Dec 2023)\n4 Ch\u014dfu Airfield (no IATA, ICAO: RJTF; \u8abf\u5e03\u98db\u884c\u5834 Ch\u014dfu hik\u014dj\u014d) (The nearest railway station is Nishi-Ch\u014dfu on the Kei\u014d Line, a 15-minute walk away. Alternatively, you can take a bus from Chofu or Mitaka stations.). Serves only some turboprop flights to the Izu Islands south of Tokyo.   \n\n\n=== By train ===\n\n5 Tokyo Station (\u6771\u4eac\u99c5 T\u014dky\u014d-eki). Tokyo is the nerve centre of railways in Japan. High speed Shinkansen services arrive here in the Chiyoda ward.   (updated Nov 2023)\nFor all trains on the northern route, you can get off at Ueno, while trains on the western route call at Shinagawa. Most non-Shinkansen services usually stops at Shibuya and Shinjuku stations as well. Ueno and Ikebukuro stations connect to the northern suburbs and neighboring prefectures.\nThere are multiple departures every hour from Hakata station in Fukuoka to Tokyo, passing through Kyoto, Osaka and Nagoya, with three types of shinkansen trains. The Nozomi is the fastest, with trains taking just about 5 hours from Fukuoka and 2\u00bd hours from Osaka. The Hikari makes more stops and takes 3 hours from Osaka, and the Kodama is the slowest, making all stops and reaching Tokyo from Osaka in 4 hours. The Nozomi trains require you to pay a supplement if you are using the Japan Rail Pass.\nMultiple cities from the north offer direct Shinkansen services to Tokyo, including Akita, Aomori, Fukushima, Hakodate, Kanazawa, Morioka, Nagano, Nagoya, Niigata, Sendai, Toyama, Yamagata and Yuzawa. All trains from these cities converge at \u014cmiya in Saitama, then run south to Ueno and Tokyo stations.\nAlthough Japan is dominated by fast Shinkansen trains there are still a couple of sleeper trains left: The Sunrise Izumo (\u30b5\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30ba\u51fa\u96f2) runs daily to Tokyo from Izumo while Sunrise Seto (\u30b5\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30ba\u702c\u6238) connects with Takamatsu, the second largest city on the Shikoku island. Both trains run coupled together between Tokyo and Okayama.\n\n\n=== By car ===\nWhile you can drive into the city, it is really not recommended as the city can be congested, signs may be confusing and parking fees are astronomical. One option that should be considered is cheaper 24-hour parking lots in cities bordering Tokyo. For example, Yashio city's train station in Saitama (prefecture) has hundreds of spaces at \u00a5500 per day, and is just minutes from Kita-Senju or Akihabara. A car of people can travel by highway at a fraction of the price of each person traveling by train, and can take the last leg by the cheapest train ticket into Tokyo.\nFor groups of 3-5 tourists traveling in Japan, a rental car to or from Tokyo to be returned at the agency counter in another city may prove to be a major chance for savings compared to train or air travel.\n\n\n=== By thumb ===\nHitchhiking into Tokyo is pretty easy, but hitchhiking out is considerably more difficult. It's definitely possible for determined cheapskates though, see Hitchhiking in Japan for a detailed list of tested escape routes from the city.\n\n\n=== By bus ===\nHighway bus services link Tokyo to other cities, resort areas and the surrounding prefectures. There are JR and private bus companies. Bus service may be cheaper, but the train is probably more convenient, especially with the JR pass.\nLong-distance buses use a number of terminals scattered throughout the city. At Tokyo Station, the main boarding point for buses is at the Yaesu Exit (\u516b\u91cd\u6d32\u53e3) on the east side. Some buses lines, including Keisei Bus, have moved to the new Bus Terminal Tokyo Yaesu (\u30d0\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30df\u30ca\u30eb\u6771\u4eac\u516b\u91cd\u6d32) which is across the street and can be accessed by underground passage from Tokyo Station. In Shinjuku, nearly all services use the new 6 Shinjuku Expressway Bus Terminal, abbreviated Busta Shinjuku (\u30d0\u30b9\u30bf\u65b0\u5bbf), which is above the JR tracks at Shinjuku Station.\n\nThe JR Bus Group - A major operator of bus services to and from Tokyo. Seat reservations for JR Buses can be made at JR Bus counters in Tokyo and Shinjuku stations, and in JR train stations at the same \"Midori-no-Madoguchi\" ticket windows used to reserve seats on trains. JR Bus Kanto (JR\u30d0\u30b9\u95a2\u6771) and JR Tokai Bus (JR\u6771\u6d77\u30d0\u30b9) offer online bookings for their buses in English.\nWiller Express - A company that has nightly bus services to and from Tokyo. Its bus services link many cities in Japan. Online booking available in English.\nKokusai Kogyo Bus (\u56fd\u969b\u8208\u696d\u30d0\u30b9)\nKeisei Bus (\u4eac\u6210\u30d0\u30b9)\nKeikyu Bus (\u4eac\u6025\u30d0\u30b9)\nKeio Bus (Japanese Website) (\u4eac\u738b\u30d0\u30b9)\nKanto Bus (\u95a2\u6771\u30d0\u30b9)\nNishi Tokyo Bus (Japanese Website) (\u897f\u6771\u4eac\u30d0\u30b9)\nOdakyu Bus (Japanese Website) (\u5c0f\u7530\u6025\u30d0\u30b9)\nOdakyu Highway Bus (\u5c0f\u7530\u6025\u30cf\u30a4\u30a6\u30a7\u30a4\u30d0\u30b9)\nSeibu Bus (\u897f\u6b66\u30d0\u30b9)\nTobu Bus (Japanese Website) (\u6771\u6b66\u30d0\u30b9)\nTohoku Kyuko Bus (\u6771\u5317\u6025\u884c\u30d0\u30b9)\n\n\n=== By boat ===\nOne of the great ports of the world, Tokyo also has domestic ferry services to other points in Japan. However, none of the regular international ferries to Japan call at Tokyo.\nThe main long-distance ferry terminal is 7 Tokyo Port Ferry Terminal, on an artificial island adjacent to Odaiba in Tokyo Bay. The nearest station is Tokyo Big Sight on the Yurikamome line, but it's still a bit of a hike. You can also take a direct bus from Shin-Kiba station on the Metro Yurakucho line. The main services from this terminal are:\n\n Kawasaki Kinkai Kisen (\u5ddd\u5d0e\u8fd1\u6d77\u6c7d\u8239), \u260f +81 3-3528-0718. This ferry has no passenger facilities, so it can only be used if you have a car. Fares for a car and driver start at \u00a525,820. (updated Dec 2017)\n Ocean Tokyu Ferry (\u30aa\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3\u30f3\u6771\u4e5d\u30d5\u30a7\u30ea\u30fc), \u260f +81 3-5148-0109. Tokyo-Kitakyushu passenger fares are \u00a516,420 for second class, \u00a530,550 for first class. \nFerries to the Izu and Ogasawara Islands leave from Takeshiba Terminal (\u7af9\u829d\u5ba2\u8239\u30bf\u30fc\u30df\u30ca\u30eb), adjacent to Takeshiba station on the Yurikamome line. Cruise liners tend to use the Harumi Terminal (\u6674\u6d77\u5ba2\u8239\u30bf\u30fc\u30df\u30ca\u30eb), best accessible on bus \u90fd05-1 (To-05-1) from Tokyo Station Marunouchi South Exit. International ferries and cargo ferries that also take passengers can leave from other terminals too, enquire with your shipping company.\n\n\n== Get around ==\n\nInstead of getting a headache from the many options for getting around in Tokyo, try Google Maps for navigation \u2013 it will show you various options and fares, so you can choose between the cheapest, the most convenient, or the quickest option, depending on your preferences. If you have a map of all metro and train stations, it might be quicker and cheaper to mainly go through them and ignore taking smallish bus rides to and from them, which will easily cost \u00a5200 per ride.\n\n\n=== By train and subway ===\nTokyo has one of the most extensive mass transit systems in the world and is the most used subway system in the world in terms of annual passenger rides. It is clean, safe and efficient \u2013 and confusing. The confusion arises from the fact that several distinct railway systems operate within Tokyo \u2013 the JR East network, the two subway networks, and various private lines \u2013 and different route maps show different systems. Avoid rush hours if possible; trains get overcrowded very easily.\nThe defining rail line in Tokyo is the JR Yamanote Line (\u5c71\u624b\u7dda Yamanote-sen), which runs in a loop around central Tokyo; being inside the Yamanote loop is synonymous with being in the core of Tokyo. Almost all inter-regional JR lines and private lines start at a station on the Yamanote. JR's lines are color-coded, the Yamanote is light green  n . The JR Chuo Line (orange  n ', \u4e2d\u592e\u7dda Ch\u016b\u014d-sen) and Chuo-Sobu Line (yellow  n , \u4e2d\u592e\u30fb\u7dcf\u6b66\u7dda Ch\u016b\u014d-S\u014dbu-sen) run side-by-side, bisecting the Yamanote loop from Shinjuku on the west to Tokyo Station on the east. JR's other commuter lines, the Saikyo and Keihin-Tohoku, run off the rim of the Yamanote loop to the north and south. JR East has a good English information line, 050-2016-1603 or 03-3423-0111.\n\nTokyo has an extensive subway network, the oldest one in Asia dating back to 1927, with frequent trains, and these are primarily useful for getting around within the Yamanote loop. The Tokyo Metro runs nine lines: Ginza, Marunouchi, Hibiya, Tozai, Chiyoda, Yurakucho, Hanzomon, Namboku and Fukutoshin lines. Toei operates the Asakusa, Mita, Shinjuku, and Oedo lines. While the JR Yamanote Line is not a subway line, due to its importance as a major transportation artery in downtown Tokyo, it is usually featured on subway maps. In addition, there is a largely underground Rinkai Line, a private line which is operated by Tokyo Waterfront Area Rapid Transit (TWR), that passes through the island of Odaiba.\nThe eight main private commuter railways radiate from the Yamanote loop out into the outlying wards and suburbs, and almost all connect through directly to subway lines within the loop (though many services terminate at stations on the Yamanote loop). The private lines are useful for day trips outside the city, and are usually slightly cheaper than JR. In addition, there are number of smaller private and \"third-sector\" (public-private partnership) lines - among these, the most well-known is arguably the Yurikamome which offers great views on the way to the island of Odaiba.\nAnnouncements and signs are usually bilingual in Japanese and English, though in some areas frequented by tourists, signs in Korean and Chinese can also be seen. That said, staff working at the stations rarely speak much, if any English.\nKeep in mind that it is impolite to speak on the phone while aboard the train. Instead, you should send text messages while switching it to silent mode. It used to be a rule of etiquette to \"stand on the left so people in a hurry can pass you on the right when using the escalator\", however the current etiquette is to stand on both sides of the escalator without walking, because walking on the escalator can cause injuries.\n\n\n==== Fares and hours ====\n\nMost tickets and passes are sold from automated vending machines. These machines are cash only but give change. At many JR stations, there are purple-colored reserved seat ticket vending machines where you can purchase tickets for JR lines using a credit card. JR trains are free with a Japan Rail Pass.\nSmart cards, instead of tickets, are convenient and highly recommended, because they allow you to ride trains without having to read the sometimes Japanese-only fare maps to determine your fare. The two smart cards sold in the Tokyo region are Suica, which is sold by JR, and PASMO, which is sold by the subway and private railway operators. Both cards can be used interchangeably, but refunds can only be processed by the respective operators that sell them. Smart cards from Japan's other regions can be used in Tokyo too; see Japan/Get around/Smart cards and Japan/Money/Smart cards for more details.  \nOtherwise, the following day passes are available:\n\nTokyo Subway Ticket: 24-hr (\u00a5800), 48-hr (\u00a51200), and 72-hr (\u00a51500) passes are available along with other combos.\nThe Tokunai Pass (\u90fd\u533a\u5185\u30d1\u30b9) is a one-day pass good for travel on JR lines anywhere in the 23 wards of Tokyo (including the entire Yamanote Line and many stations surrounding it). It costs \u00a5760, making it economical if you plan to make five or more train hops in one day. A variant is the Tokunai Free Kippu (\u90fd\u533a\u5185\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u304d\u3063\u3077), which also includes a round-trip into Tokyo from stations in the surrounding prefectures. The Monorail And Tokunai Free Kippu, which is good for two days and includes a round-trip from Haneda Airport to central Tokyo, costs \u00a52,000.\nThe Tokyo Free Kippu (\u6771\u4eac\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u304d\u3063\u3077) covers all JR, subway and city bus lines within the 23 wards. It costs \u00a51,600 for one day and covers a number of areas that are not served by JR, such as Roppongi and Odaiba.\nThe Holiday Pass (\u4f11\u65e5\u304a\u3067\u304b\u3051\u30d1\u30b9) covers the entire JR network in the Tokyo metropolitan area, including Chiba, Kanagawa, Saitama and west Tokyo. It costs \u00a52,720 for one day, and is only available on weekends, national holidays and during the Golden Week (Apr 29 to May 5), summer vacation (July 20 through Aug 31) and New Year (Dec 29 to Jan 3). But you will barely ever hit such high daily costs when travelling on Tokyo's public transport \u2014 you will want to spend you time sightseeing and shopping, not sitting in the train.\n\nIf you are paying \u00e0 la (smart) carte, subway and train fares are based on distance, ranging from \u00a5110 to \u00a5310 for hops within central Tokyo. As a rule of thumb, Tokyo Metro lines are cheapest, Toei lines are most expensive, and JR lines fall somewhere in the middle (but are usually cheaper than Metro for short trips, i.e. no more than 4 stations). Many of the private lines interoperate with the subways, which can occasionally make a single ride seem unreasonably expensive as you are in essence transferring to another line and fare system, even though you're still on the same train. E.g. changing between Metro subway line and Tokyu private line amounts to paying the sum of each fare: minimum fare Metro \u00a5160 + minimum fare Tokyu \u00a5120 = \u00a5280. In addition, several patterns of transfer are listed as \"Transfer Discount\", and the most famous one is \u00a570 discount, that applies to a transfer between Tokyo Metro and Toei subway lines. When using Suica or PASMO, you can get all transfer discounts automatically. At some transfer stations, you may need to pass through a special transfer gate (both for paper tickets and PASMO/Suica) which is coloured orange \u2013 passing through the regular blue gate will not get you your transfer discount and if you have a paper ticket, you won't get it back. At some transfer points (e.g. Asakusa station) you may actually need to transfer on street level as the two stations (Metro Ginza Line and Toei Asakusa Line) are not physically connected and are about one block apart.\nIt pays to check your route beforehand. The Tokyo Subway Navigation for Tourists by the Tokyo Metro, is a mobile app that allows you to plan subway and train travel from point A to point B, based on time, cost, and transfers. This app provides information for Tokyo only. For other apps or sites which cover the whole country, see the Japan page. \nIf you can't figure out how much it is to the destination, you can buy the cheapest ticket and pay the difference at the Fare Adjustment Machine (norikoshi) at the end. Most vending machines will let you buy a single ticket that covers a transfer between JR, subway and private lines, all the way to your destination, but working out how to do this may be a challenge if you are not familiar with the system. When transferring between systems, whether paying with tickets or smart cards, use the orange transfer gates to exit. Otherwise, you'll be charged full fare for both separate parts of your trip, instead of the cheaper transfer fare.\nMost train lines in Tokyo run 05:00\u201301:00. During peak hours they run about once every three minutes; even during off-peak hours it's less than ten minutes between trains. The only night when regular passenger services run overnight is for the New Year's Holiday on select lines.\nFor additional information for train travel in Japan generally, refer to the By rail section in the Japan article.\n\n\n=== By taxi ===\n\nTaxis are very pricey, but may be a value for groups of three or more. Also, if you miss your last train, you may not have another choice.\nFares were revised in 2022 in an effort to make taxis more attractive for short-distance trips, though longer trips are still very expensive. The fare for the standard taxis starts at \u00a5500 for up to 1.096 km (0.681 mi), and goes up \u00a5100 every 255 metres (0.158 mi) and for every 95 seconds in stopped or slow traffic. A 20% night surcharge is tacked on from 22:00-05:00, and tolls are added for any trips using the expressway.\nHere are some daytime fare examples based on Nihon Kotsu's taxi fare estimates (actual fares may vary):\n\nTokyo Station to Akihabara Station \u2013 3.0 km (1.9 mi), \u00a51,600\nTokyo Station to Shinjuku Station (Bus Terminal) \u2013 8.1 km (5.0 mi), \u00a54,300\nTokyo Station to Haneda Airport Terminal 1 \u2013 19.2 km (11.9 mi), \u00a510,200 including expressway fare\nTaxi rear left passenger doors are operated by the driver and open and close automatically. Don't open or close them yourself.\nDo not count on your taxi driver speaking English\u2014or knowing more than the best-known locations, though most taxis have GPS \"car navi\" systems installed. The best and easiest thing to do is to prepare a map marked with where you want to go, and point it out on the map to the taxi driver. If you are staying at a hotel, they will provide a map. If possible, get a business card, or print out the address in Japanese of any specific places you wish to go. However, because in Japan streets are often unmarked, if the taxi driver does not have GPS he may not be able to do more than take you to the general vicinity of where you want to go. Also, taxis can get caught in traffic jams. No tips are expected or given.\nNihon Kotsu has a 24-hr English telephone number, 03-5755-2336, to call for a Nihon Kotsu taxi within Tokyo. There is a booking fee payable to the driver at the end of the trip: \u00a5410 for an immediate hail or \u00a5820 for an advance booking. If you already have a destination (or a few) in mind, the receptionist will electronically transmit the information to the driver so that you don't have to tell the driver yourself. If you are hailing a taxi right away, the English receptionist will inform you about your assigned taxi by color, company name and taxi number.\nA growing number of companies in Tokyo also offer taxi hails and ride requests by mobile apps including GO Taxi, DiDi and Uber. Your hotel's front desk can also call a taxi for you, subject to the same booking fees.\n\n\n=== By ride hailing ===\nYou can use Uber to hail limousines and taxis for a \u00a5500 surcharge, which may be worth it to bypass both the language barrier and potential payment hassles.\nStarting in April 2024 the Japanese government is planning to allow limited ride-sharing services under the supervision of taxi companies.\n\n\n=== By car ===\nTokyo is a gigantic warren of narrow streets with no names, with slow-moving traffic and extremely limited and expensive parking. In this city with such an excellent mass transit system, you would need a good reason to want to drive around instead. While renting a car can make sense in Japan in some contexts (e.g., visiting a rural onsen resort), in general it is neither convenient nor economical to rent a car to get around metro Tokyo. Taxis are much more convenient if your budget allows it; walking or public transportation is much less expensive and given the difficulties of navigation and finding parking in popular areas, probably easier too.\nIf you do decide to plunge in and drive around by car, the main expressway serving Tokyo is the Shuto Expressway, abbreviated to Shutoko (\u9996\u90fd\u9ad8). The C1 Loop Line forms a circle around central Tokyo, similar in fashion to how the Yamanote Line does it by rail. But whereas the Yamanote Line charges \u00a5140-200 for a single trip, driving a car onto the Shutoko in Tokyo costs \u00a51320 every time you enter the system (compact cars slightly cheaper), with additional tolls collected at various other locations. Vehicles equipped with Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) tags pay a cheaper rate based on the distance driven.\nDriving on the Tokyo Expressway at night can be a pleasant and beautiful experience as you whiz through and around the Tokyo nightlife. When driving at night you should exercise caution and obey speed limits: Street racing over the Shutoko at night became popular in the 80s and 90s and still happens today, albeit on a less frequent basis. Street racers often concentrate their driving on the C1 Loop Line and the Bayshore (more popularly known as the Wangan) Line. \"Competitors\" sometimes hang out at parking and service areas on the Shutoko, especially the large Daikoku Parking Area at the intersection of the Bayshore Line and the K5 Daikoku Line in Yokohama.\n\n\n=== By bus ===\n\nThe few areas within Tokyo that aren't easily accessible by train are served by various bus companies. Buses operating within 23 wards of Tokyo have a fixed fare regardless of distance (\u00a5210 on Toei buses and \u00a5220 on other private bus companies), which is paid upon boarding from the front door. The fares are not transferable; however most buses do accept Suica or PASMO fare cards (see above). Compared to the trains, the buses run much less frequently, carry fewer passengers, and are much slower. This makes them amenable to the elderly residents of Tokyo, but rather inconvenient for travelers, who will also have to deal with lack of information in English and sometimes very well hidden bus stops. Bus routes can be fairly complicated and are often not listed in detail at the bus stops; signs on the buses themselves often list only two or three main stops in addition to the origin and destination. Inside the bus the next stop is usually announced several times, sometimes by a taped voice and sometimes by a mumbling driver. Taped announcements in English are used on some lines, but are still rare. Nevertheless, north\u2013south routes are useful in the western side of the city since train lines (Odakyu, Keio, Chuo, and Seibu) tend to run east\u2013west.\nIn an attempt to provide some information about their buses to foreign visitors/residents, Toei Bus has a web site that shows some of the main bus routes used to go to certain destinations in Tokyo. This information is provided in English and several other languages. You can download English route maps and apps at this site.\nIn addition, most private railway companies are accompanied by bus companies with corresponding names. They serve the areas outside of Yamanote Line loop, around their railway lines.\n\n\n==== Sky Hop Bus ====\nWiller Express operates a hop-on, hop-off bus service called the Sky Hop Bus, which bills itself as \"the first open-top double decker bus in Japan\". At a charge of \u00a51,800 for a 24-hour pass and \u00a52,500 for a 48-hour pass (children half price), you can ride these buses and hop on and off as often as you wish. There are three bus routes that operate, all from the Marunouchi Building next to Tokyo Station: One route serves Asakusa and Tokyo SkyTree, the second runs to Roppongi and Tokyo Tower, and the third runs to Odaiba. The service only runs hourly, with departures from the Marunouchi Building between 10:20 and 18:30.\n\n\n=== By boat ===\n\nThe Tokyo Cruise Ship Company operates a series of Water Bus ferries along the Sumida River and in Tokyo Bay, connecting Asakusa, Hinode, Harumi and Odaiba. The ferries feature a recorded tour announced in English as well as Japanese and a trip on one makes for a relaxing, leisurely way to see the waterfront areas of Tokyo. The super-futuristic Himiko ferry, designed by anime and manga creator Leiji Matsumoto, runs on the Asakusa-Odaiba Direct Line. You might want to arrive well before the departure time just in case tickets on the Himiko sell out!\nTokyo Mizube Line (\u6771\u4eac\u6c34\u8fba\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3) also operates short routes starting from Ryogoku-Asakusa area.\n\n\n=== By bicycle ===\nBicycles are very commonly used for local transport, but amenities like bicycle lanes are rare, drivers pay little heed to bikes and traffic can be very heavy on weekdays, so if you use a bicycle, do not be afraid to cycle on the sidewalk (everyone does). Parts of Tokyo are surprisingly hilly, and it's a sweaty job pedaling around in the summer heat. Central Tokyo can still be covered fairly comfortably by bike on the weekends. Tokyo Great Cycling Tour offers a one-day guided tour for biking around major tourist spots in Tokyo, like Marunouchi, Nihonbashi, Tsukiji, Odaiba, Tokyo tower, Imperial palace and so on.\nParking your bicycle becomes a challenge in Tokyo, especially in the downtown area where you need to pay for parking and cannot simply leave the bike by a store/restaurant/shrine entrances on the sidewalk. Keep this in mind with renting a bicycle in dense urban areas of Japan.\nRenting a bike is possible from some youth hostels, particularly around Asakusa, although it's not common. However, buying a simple single-speed roadster is fairly cheap, and comes complete with a built-in bicycle wheel lock system (this is what most Tokyoites use). An imported multiple-geared bike will be much more expensive so get a good lock, as bike theft is a common threat, although the problem is nowhere near as serious as in other countries.\nBicycle rentals are common around all of Japan and increasingly so in the more rural areas at train stations.\nFor rentals in the Tokyo area GS Astuto cycle shop has a full range of rental bikes geared at regular cyclists who primarily ride road bikes. GS Astuto can also deliver bikes to your hotel where you will stay.\nAnother option is to choose a cycling tour with a company. This can be a great way to get on a bike and see the best parts of Japan by bicycle. Within Tokyo Soshi's Tokyo Bike Tour, Tokyo Great Cycling Tour, and Bicycle Tours Tokyo offer day tours of popular sites within central Tokyo by bike. For an escape into the rural edges of Tokyo Bike Tour Japan takes guests on week long cycling adventures in the countryside just 1-2hrs from central Tokyo.\n\n\n=== On foot ===\nIn this large city with such an efficient public transportation system, walking to get from point A to point B would seem a bit stupid at first glance. However, as the city is extremely safe even at night, walking in Tokyo can be a very pleasant experience. In some areas, walking can be much shorter than taking the subway and walking the transit (the whole Akasaka/Nagatacho/Roppongi area in the center is for instance very easily covered on foot). If you have the time, Shinjuku to Shibuya via Omotesando takes roughly one hour, Tokyo Station to Shinjuku would be a half a day walk, and the whole Yamanote line Grand Tour takes a long day.\n\n\n== See ==\n\nTokyo has a vast array of sights, but the first items on the agenda of most visitors are the temples of Asakusa, the gardens of the Imperial Palace (in Chiyoda) and the Meiji Shrine (\u660e\u6cbb\u795e\u5bae Meiji-jing\u016b, in Harajuku).\nTokyo has many commercial centres for shopping, eating and simply wandering around for experiencing the modern Japanese urban phenomenon. Each of these areas have unique characteristics, such as dazzling Shinjuku, youthful Shibuya and upmarket Ginza. These areas are bustling throughout the day, but they really come to life in the evenings.\nIf you are looking for a viewing platform, Tokyo has plenty of options:\n\nThe Tokyo SkyTree is Tokyo's latest attraction in Sumida, not to mention it's also the third-tallest structure in the world at 634 m above the ground. However, its location away from downtown means the view is a distant jumble of buildings.\nThe more familiar Tokyo Tower in Minato is still around, and it is not as expensive as the latter and newest rival, but neither is the view as good as some alternatives.\n\nFor a view that is light on your wallet, head to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Center (in effect, Tokyo's City Hall) in Shinjuku. Its twin towers have viewing platforms that are absolutely free, and offer a great view over Tokyo and beyond.\nAnother equally light-on-your-wallet option is the Carrot Tower in Setagaya, just 3.2 km west of Shibuya Station. It has a restaurant on the 26th floor with views to the west and south (Yokohama) \u2014 the views can be enjoyed without having to eat at the restaurant.\nTokyo City View in Roppongi has an observation deck with great views of Tokyo Bay and downtown Tokyo including the nearby Tokyo Tower \u2014 admission is a steep \u00a51,800-2,300 though, but includes admission to the Mori Art Museum.\nThe Rainbow Bridge linking Tokyo to Odaiba is another good option, if you don't mind traffic noise and smell. The bridge's pedestrian walkways (open until 20:00) are free, and the night-time view across Tokyo Bay is impressive. Odaiba Rainbow Bus starting at Shinagawa and Tamachi stations is a cheap way (\\220) to enjoy the view.\nThe Bunkyo Civic Center next to the Tokyo Dome in Bunkyo, dubbed by one newspaper as a \"colossal Pez candy dispenser\", has a free observation deck on the 25th floor offering an iconic view of Shinjuku against Mount Fuji on a clear day.\nThe city is dotted with museums, large and small, which center on every possible interest from pens to antique clocks to traditional and modern arts. Many of the largest museums are clustered around Ueno. Though, at \u00a5500\u20131,000 or more, entrance fees can add up quickly.\nYanaka is Tokyo's most traditional and quaint district. It retains its pleasant atmosphere and old town ambience and offers a sightseeing opportunity from different parts of the city's metropolitan area.\nRiding Sky Bus Tokyo, an open-top double-decker operated by Hinomaru Limousine (hourly 10:00\u201318:00), is a good option to take a quick tour around the city center. The 45-min bus ride on the \"T-01 course\" will take you around the Imperial Palace via Ginza and Marunouchi district, showing the highlight of Tokyo's shopping and business center. The fare is \u00a51,500 for adults of 12 years old and over, and \u00a5700 for children between 4 and 11 years old. You can borrow a multi-language voice guide system free of charge upon purchasing a ticket, subject to stock availability. Four other bus courses are offered, including a night trip to Odaiba, but those trips are conducted in Japanese with no foreign language guidance.\nTokyo offers some great spots to catch stunning views of Mount Fuji, Japan's highest summit, even though it's about 100 kilometres away from the city.\n\n\n== Do ==\nSee the tuna auction at the Toyosu Market and eat a sushi breakfast at the former Tsukiji Fish Market.\nTake a boat ride on the Sumida River from Asakusa.\nLose yourself in the dazzling neon jungle outside major train stations in the evenings. Shibuya and east Shinjuku at night can make Times Square or Piccadilly Circus look rural in comparison \u2014 it has to be seen to be believed.\nEnjoy a soak in a local \"sento\" or public bath. Or one of the onsen theme parks such as LaQua at the Tokyo Dome (Bunkyo).\nGo to an amusement park such as Tokyo Disney Resort, which consists of Tokyo Disneyland and Tokyo DisneySea which are Asia's most visited (in Urayasu City Chiba) and second most visited theme parks respectively, or the more Japanese Sanrio Puroland (in Tama), home to more Hello Kitties than you can imagine.\nJoin and bar hop or pub crawl along with events groups in Roppongi,\nCheck out the hip and young crowd at Harajuku's Takeshita-Dori (Takeshita Street) or the more grown up Omotesando.\nIn the spring, take a boatride in Kichijoji's lovely Inokashira Park, and afterwards visit the Ghibli Studios Museum (well known for their amazing movies, like Spirited Away, and Princess Mononoke), but you will need to buy tickets for these in advance at a Lawson convenience store.\nTake the Yurikamome elevated train across the bay bridge from Shimbashi station to the bayside Odaiba district, and startle at the scenery including a giant Unicorn Gundam robot statue.\nWatch a baseball game, namely the Yomiuri Giants at the Tokyo Dome, or the Tokyo Yakult Swallows at Jingu Stadium. Nearby Chiba hosts the Chiba Lotte Marines.\nTake a stroll through the Imperial Palace's East Gardens (open to the public daily at 09:00, except Fridays and Mondays).\nHave a picnic in a park during the cherry blossom (Sakura). Unfortunately Sakura only lasts for about 10-14 days in Spring. But be warned, parks are usually very crowded during this time.\nJoin a local for a short lunch or dinner homestay with Nagomi Visit's home visit program or participate in their cooking classes.\nRaising a glass in this colourful nightlife at Shinjuku district.\nJoining the Harajuku's eccentric fashion tribes as they shop.\nLosing yourself in the vestiges of the old area Yanesen (Yanaka-Nezu-Sendagi).\nAkihabara \u2014 Venturing into the belly of pop culture beast.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\nSanja Matsuri (\u4e09\u793e\u796d), third weekend in May. Tokyo's largest festival, held near Sensoji Temple in Asakusa, this three-day extravaganza sees up to 2 million people turn out to watch the parade of portable shrines (mikoshi) with music, dancing and geisha performances.\nSumidagawa Fireworks Festival (\u9685\u7530\u5ddd\u82b1\u706b\u5927\u4f1a Sumidagawa Hanabi Taikai), fourth Saturday in July. Huge fireworks competition that sees up to a million people line the banks of the Sumida River.\n\n\n== Learn ==\nThe curious can study traditional culture such as tea ceremony, calligraphy, or martial arts such as Karate, Judo, Aikido and Kendo. There are also many language schools to help you work on your Japanese. Several universities in Tokyo cater to international students at the undergraduate or graduate level.\n\n\n=== Universities ===\nKeio University (\u6176\u61c9\u7fa9\u587e\u5927\u5b66 Kei\u014d Gijuku Daigaku) \u2014 Japan's top private university (unless you ask a Waseda student). Established in the samurai days of yore and has a stuffier rep than Waseda, with alumni including former prime minister Junichiro Koizumi. Main campus in Mita.\nSophia University (\u4e0a\u667a\u5927\u5b66 J\u014dchi Daigaku) \u2014 A prestigious private, Jesuit university well known for its foreign language curricula and large foreign student population. Main campus in Yotsuya.\nInstitute of Science Tokyo (\u6771\u4eac\u79d1\u5b66\u5927\u5b66 T\u014dky\u014d Kagaku Daigaku) \u2014 Formed through the merger of the Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan's top technical university, and Tokyo Medical and Dental University in October 2024. Its main campus is the former Tokyo Institute of Technology main campus in Ookayama.\nUniversity of Tokyo (\u6771\u4eac\u5927\u5b66 T\u014dky\u014d Daigaku) \u2014 Japan's uncontested number one university, especially strong in law, medicine and literature. For locals, passing the entrance exams is fiendishly difficult, but exchange students can enter much more easily. Five campuses are scattered around the city, but the main campus is in Hongo. Colloquially known by the shortened form \u6771\u5927 (T\u014ddai).\nWaseda University (\u65e9\u7a32\u7530\u5927\u5b66 Waseda Daigaku) \u2014 Japan's top private university (unless you ask a Keio student), famous as a den of artists and partiers. It has produced the second most number of prime ministers of Japan, after the University of Tokyo, including former prime minister Fumio Kishida. Main campus in Waseda.\n\n\n== Work ==\nTeaching English (or to a lesser extent, other foreign languages) is still the easiest way to work in Tokyo, but the city also offers more work options than other areas of the country: everything from restaurant work to IT. Certain nationalities are eligible for working holiday visas: for others, work permits can be very hard to come by without a job offer from a Japanese company. Consult your local Japanese consulate/embassy as far in advance as possible.\n\n\n== Buy ==\n\nTokyo is one of the fashion and cosmetic centers in the Eastern world. Items to look for include electronics, funky fashions, antique furniture and kimono, as well as specialty items like Hello Kitty goods, anime and comics and their associated paraphernalia.\nCredit cards are widely accepted by major retailers, and there is a major government push to move towards cashless means of payment, including subsidies of 2-5% for doing so. \"Cashless\" here includes credit cards, transport cards like Suica/PASMO, Google/Apple Pay on your phone and a plethora of local apps. That said, cash remains king and many smaller shops and street stalls are still cash only. ATMs usually give out only \u00a510,000 notes, but retailers are generally happy to make change. Most major bank ATMs now allow withdrawals from overseas banks with your usual ATM card.  Japan Post ATMs are bilingual and will allow you to withdraw money at the day's exchange rate without charging you any special fees.\nThe crime rate is very low, so don't be afraid of carrying around wads of cash as the Japanese do. The average Japanese citizen will carry a month's worth of expenses on them (around \u00a540,000 give or take). See Buy under Japan for general caveats regarding electronics and media compatibility.\nThere are numerous convenience stores throughout Tokyo (such as Seven-Eleven, Lawson, and Family-Mart), which are open around the clock and sell not only food and magazines, but also daily necessities such as underwear and toiletries. Supermarkets are usually open until 22:00, while drugstores and department stores usually close at 21:00.\n\n\n=== Anime and manga ===\nAkihabara, Tokyo's Electric Town, is now also the unquestioned center of its otaku community, and the stores along Chuo-dori are packed to the rafters with anime (animation) and manga (comics).\nAnother popular district for all things manga/anime is the Nakano ward and its Broadway Shopping arcade. Check out the Mandarake shop for loads of used and rare mangas.\nThere has been an \"otaku boom\" in Akihabara. A lot of attention in particular was paid to the town thanks to the popular Japanese drama \"Densha Otoko\", a (true) love story about an otaku who saves a woman from a molester on a train and their subsequent courtship.\nAkihabara was previously known for its many live performances and cosplayers, some of which had drawn negative attention due to extremist performers. These have become increasingly scarce following the Akihabara massacre in 2008, although girls in various maid costumes can still be seen standing along the streets handing out advertisement fliers to passers by for maid cafes.\nIf you like a specific anime or character, Tokyo has no shortages of official stores dedicated to a specific character or anime series.\n\n\n=== Antiques ===\nSerious collectors should head for the Antique Mall in Ginza or the Antique Market in Omotesando, which are collections of small very specialist shops (samurai armor, ukiyo-e prints, etc). However, the prices tend to be very high.\nLess wealthy shoppers can venture over to Nishi-Ogikubo, which sells scrolls of calligraphy (and some other similar items) for a few thousand yen.\nThe Antique Festival (\u5168\u56fd\u53e4\u6c11\u5177\u9aa8\u8463\u796d\u308a) is held over the weekend about 5-6 times a year at the Tokyo Ryutsu Center, on the Tokyo Monorail line, and is well worth a visit.\n\n\n=== Books ===\nJinbocho is to used books what Akihabara is to electronics. It's clustered around the Jinbocho subway stop.\nThe Blue Parrot is another shop at Takadanobaba on the Yamanote line, just two stops north of Shinjuku.\n\n\n=== Cameras and electronics ===\nEver since Sony and Nikon became synonymous with high-tech quality, Tokyo has been a favored place for buying electronics and cameras. Though the lines have blurred since the PC revolution, each has its traditional territory and stores: Akihabara has the electronics stores, including a large number of duty-free shops specializing in export models, and Shinjuku has the camera stores. Unfortunately, local model electronics are not cheap, but the export models are similar to what you'll pay back home. You can sometimes find cheap local models if you avoid big shops and check smaller retailers. It's also surprisingly difficult to find certain things e.g. games machines.\n\n\n=== Fashion ===\nShibuya and neighboring Harajuku are the best-known shopping areas for funky, youthful clothes and accessories. Almost without exception, clothes are sized for the petite Japanese frame.\nDepartment stores and exclusive boutiques stock every fashion label imaginable, but for global labels prices in Tokyo are typically higher than anywhere else in the world. The famous Ginza and Ikebukuro's giant Seibu and Tobu department stores are good hunting grounds. Roppongi Hills and the adjacent Tokyo Midtown have emerged as popular shopping malls for high-end shopping, with many major global and local Japanese brands. Other department stores in Tokyo are Isetan, Mitsukoshi, Marui (OIOI), Matsuzakaya, Matsuya and Takashimaya. Mitsukoshi/Isetan group is Japan's biggest department store chain. Mitsukoshi's anchor store is in Nihonbashi, and is particularly known for its premier kimono department. Marui Men store in Shinjuku has eight floors of mid to high-end fashion for men only.\n\n\n=== Kitchenware ===\nThe district for this is Kappabashi Street near Asakusa, also known as \u201cKitchen Town.\u201d The street is lined with stores selling all kinds of kitchen wares \u2014 this is where the restaurants of Tokyo get their supplies. It's also a great place to find cheap Japanese ceramics, not to mention plastic food!\n\n\n=== Music ===\nOchanomizu is to the guitar what Jinbocho is to used books. There, you'll find what must be the world's densest collection of guitar shops. Plenty of other musical instruments (though not traditional Japanese ones) are also available.\n\n\n=== Souvenirs ===\nFor touristy Japanese knickknacks, the best places to shop are Nakamise in Asakusa and the Oriental Bazaar in Omotesando, which stock all the kitschy things like kanji-emblazoned T-shirts, foreigner-sized kimono, ninja outfits for kids and ersatz samurai swords that can be surprisingly difficult to find elsewhere. Both also have a selection of serious antiques for the connoisseur, but see also Antiques above.\nTokyo has more than 50 satellite shops (called \"antenna shops\" in Japan) for other prefectures and smaller municipalities around Japan - you can buy foods and souvenirs of rural areas without actually going there. Some of these shops have local cuisine restaurants too. They have an official multilingual site searchable by region and shop location in Tokyo.\n\n\n=== Street markets ===\nBustling open-air bazaars in the Asian style are rare in Tokyo, except for Ueno's Ameyoko, a legacy of the postwar occupation. Yanaka Ginza in the Shitamachi Taito district, a very nice example of a neighborhood shopping street, makes for an interesting afternoon browse.\nThere are often small flea and antique markets in operation on the weekend at major (and minor) shrines in and around Tokyo.\n\n\n== Eat ==\n\nVisitors from Western countries may be surprised to find that despite its justified reputation for being an expensive city, eating out in Tokyo can be surprisingly affordable. While fine dining establishments in Tokyo can be some of the most expensive in the world, at the budget end of the spectrum, it is fairly easy to find a basic rice or noodle joint serving up meals starting from \u00a5400; a price that is unmatched even by McDonald's or other fast food chains in the West.\nTokyo has a large quantity and variety of food. Department stores have food halls, typically in the basement, with food which is comparable to top delicatessans in other world cities (though mostly Japanese and Japanized foreign food). Some basements of train stations have supermarkets with free taste testers. It's a great way to sample some of the strange dishes they have for free.\nTokyo has a large number of restaurants, so see the main Japan guide for the types of food you will encounter and some popular chains. Menus are often posted outside, so you can check the prices. Some shops have the famous plastic food in their front windows. Don't hesitate to drag the waiting staff out to the front to point at what you want. Always carry cash. Many restaurants will not accept credit cards.\nTokyo has tens of thousands of restaurants representing many cuisines in the world, though sometimes adjusted for local tastes, but it also offers a few unique local specialties. Within Japan, Tokyo cuisine is best known for 3 dishes: sushi, tempura, and unagi (freshwater eel). Nigirizushi (fish pressed onto rice), known around the world simply as \"sushi,\" in fact originates from Tokyo, and within Japan is known as Edo-mae zushi (Edo-style sushi). Another is monjayaki (\u3082\u3093\u3058\u3083\u713c\u304d), a gooey, cabbage-filled version of okonomiyaki that uses a very thin batter to achieve a sticky, caramelized consistency. It is originally from the Tsukishima area of Chuo and today there are many restaurants near Asakusa offering monjayaki.\n\n\n=== Budget ===\n\nGo to a convenience store (konbini), there is one on every second corner. Really, the options may surprise you. You can get rice balls (onigiri), bread-rolls, salads, prepared foods (like nikuman and oden), and drinks (both hot and cold) for \u00a5100-150, bent\u014d lunch boxes for around \u00a5500 and sandwiches for \u00a5250-350. At most convenience stores, microwaves are available to heat up your food for no additional cost. Supermarkets (s\u016bp\u0101) are usually cheaper and offer a wider choice, but are more difficult to find. (Try Asakusa and the sidestreets of Ueno's Ameyoko market for local\u2014not big chain\u2014supermarkets.). Supermarkets are a good place to buy discount food after 20:00. Also, \u00a5100 shops (hyaku-en shoppu) have become very common, and most have a selection of convenient, ready to eat items. There are \u00a5100 shops near most minor train stations, and usually tucked away somewhere within two or three blocks of the big stations. In particular, look for the green and red \"Lawson 100\" signs; these chains are essentially small grocery stores.\nAlso, look for bent\u014d shops like Hotto-Motto (\u307b\u3063\u3068\u3082\u3063\u3068) and Kitchen Origin (\u30ad\u30c3\u30c1\u30f3\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30f3) which sell take-out lunch boxes. They range in quality and cost, but most offer good, basic food at a reasonable price. This is what students and office workers often eat. In addition, COVID-19 forced many restaurants to sell takeaway lunchboxes to survive and the custom has stuck, adding more options to choose from.\nNoodle shops, curry shops, and bakeries are often the best option for people eating on the cheap. They are everywhere. The noodle bars on every corner are great for filling up and are very cheap at \u00a5300\u20131000. You buy your meal ticket from a vending machine at the door with pictures of the dishes and hand it to the serving staff. The one question you will typically have to answer for the counterman is whether you want soba (\u305d\u3070) (thin brown buckwheat) or udon (\u3046\u3069\u3093) (thick white wheat) noodles. Some offer standing room only with a counter to place your bowl, while others have limited counter seating. During peak times, you need to be quick as others will be waiting. Pseudo Chinese-style ramen (\u30e9\u30fc\u30e1\u30f3) (yellow wheat and egg noodles) are a little more expensive and typically sold in specialist shops, with prices starting from \u00a5400, but are typically served in very flavourful pork or chicken broth that has been boiled overnight. Tokyo is generally known among the Japanese for shoyu ramen, in which soy sauce is used to add flavour to the pork broth.\nFast food is available just about everywhere, including many American chains like McDonald's, Burger King, Subway and KFC. But if you are visiting Japan from overseas, and wish to sample Japanese fast food, why not try MOS Burger, Freshness Burger, Lotteria, or First Kitchen? If you're looking for something more Japanese, try one of the local fast food giants, Matsuya, Yoshinoya, and Sukiya, which specialize in donburi: a giant bowl of meat, rice, and vegetables, sometimes with egg thrown in for good measure, starting around \u00a5450 for the flagship gy\u016bdon (beef bowl). Another good option is oyako don (chicken and egg bowl, literally \u201cmother and child bowl\u201d), which the somewhat smaller chain Nakau specializes in. Drinking water or hot ocha (Japanese green tea) is usually available at no extra cost. There are also a number of tempura chains, with some budget options. More upscale but still affordable and rather more interesting, is Ootoya, which serves up a larger variety of home-style cooking for under \u00a51000. Yayoi-ken is a chain of eateries serving teishoku, complete set meals: buy a ticket from the machine, and you'll get miso soup, main course (fish or meat, often with vegetables), rice (bottomless, just ask for refills), a small hunk of fresh tofu, pickles and tea, and still be left with some change from your \u00a51000.\nRaw fish enthusiasts are urged to try kaitenzushi (conveyor belt sushi), where the prices can be very reasonable. Prices do depend on the color of the plate, however, and some items are very expensive, so be sure to check before they start to pile up.\nA great option for a quick bite or for groups is yakitori (grilled chicken) \u2013 individual skewers are often below \u00a5150.\nMany of the larger train and subway stations have fast, cheap eateries. Around most stations, there will be ample choices of places to eat, including chain coffeeshops (which often serve sandwiches, baked goods, and pasta dishes), yakitori places, and even Italian restaurants.\n\n\n=== Mid-range ===\nThere are a great many excellent and affordable lunch choices in busier neighborhoods like Shibuya and Shinjuku, especially during the week \u2013 expect to spend about \u00a51000 (without drinks) for a meal.\nBy tradition the basement of almost any department store, including Mitsukoshi, Matsuzakaya, or Isetan, is devoted to the depachika (\u30c7\u30d1\u5730\u4e0b), a huge array of small shops selling all kinds of prepared take-out food. You can assemble a delicious if slightly pricey picnic here \u2013 or, if you're feeling really cheap, just go around eating free samples! The very largest department stores are Tobu and Seibu in Ikebukuro, but Shibuya, Ginza and in fact any major Tokyo district will have their fair share. Shinjuku Station is home to several famous department stores, such as the Keio and Odakyu department stores. Many stores begin discounting their selections at about 19:00 each night. Look for signs and stickers indicating specific yen value or percentage discounts. You will often see half-price stickers which read \u534a\u5024 (hanne). This discounting is also common at supermarkets at the smaller stations, although the quality may be a notch or two down from the department stores, it's still perfectly edible.\nThe ubiquitous izakaya, a cross between a pub and a casual restaurant, invariably serve a good range of Japanese dishes and can be good places to fill up without breaking the bank: in most, an evening of eating and drinking won't cost more than around \u00a53000 per person. See Drink for details.\nThere is a great variety of restaurants serving Tokyo's world-famous sushi at every price point, with fish fresh from Toyosu, the world's largest fish market. It is possible to get sushi for as little as \u00a5100/piece or less (at chain stores), or spend upwards of \u00a510,000 (at elegant Ginza restaurants), but a typical spend is \u00a53000\u20134000, depending on selection (drinks extra). Usually omakase (chef's choice) gives a good deal and selection, to which you can add a piece or two a la carte if desired. A popular choice with tourists is a sushi breakfast at Tsukiji, former home of the fish market, particularly for one's jet-lagged first morning, or after a night out partying. Most sushi shops in the outer market of Tsukiji open at 8 or 9AM, though there are some 24-hour shops, and particularly popular are two small stores in the inner market that open before 6AM and feature market ambience and very long queues; see Chuo: Mid-range dining.\nThe best-known tempura chain is Tsunahachi, where depending on the store you can pay from below \u00a51000 for lunch to over \u00a56000 for dinner.\nA classic modern Japanese dish is tonkatsu (\u201cpork cutlet\u201d), and there are good Tokyo options; the fattier loin (\u30ed\u30fc\u30b9 \u201croast\u201d) is generally considered tastier than the leaner fillet (hire \u30d2\u30ec). The most famous restaurant is Tonki, right by Meguro station (1-1-2 Shimo-Meguro, Meguro-ku, Tokyo), serving a standard meal at about \u00a51600, dinner only (from 16:00). While it is an institution with a loyal clientele (and frequent lines), and decidedly has atmosphere (similar to an established New York deli), the food gets mixed reviews, and is less succulent than other options \u2013 an interesting experience, however. Next most famous is the chain Maisen (\u307e\u3044\u6cc9), which serves delicious if somewhat expensive tonkatsu (various varieties and seasonal options) at many locations in Tokyo, most notably at their flagship shop in Aoyama by Omotesand\u014d station (Jingumae 4-8-5, closing at 19:00). The top-end dish is Okita Kurobuta (Berkshire pork by Mr. Okita), at \u00a53,800 for a meal, though they have cheaper options. A modern option is Butagumi, at Nishi-Azabu 2-24-9 (west of Roppongi station), serving a variety of premium pork brands expertly prepared.\nTokyo also has a large number of Korean restaurants, generally midrange, and many yakiniku (grilled meat) restaurants are Korean-influenced.\n\n\n=== Splurge ===\nTokyo has the world's highest number of Michelin-starred restaurants, with prices to match. For upmarket Japanese eats, Ginza is guaranteed to burn a hole in your wallet, with Akasaka and Roppongi Hills close behind. Top-end restaurants are primarily Japanese, with a few French. Tokyo is widely regarded as the spiritual home of a fine style of sushi known as edomae-zushi (\u6c5f\u6238\u524d\u5bff\u53f8). Besides sushi, Tokyo's fine dining scene also includes Japanese contemporary, tempura and kaiseki. You can limit the damage considerably by eating fixed lunch sets instead of dinner, as this is when restaurants cater to people paying their own meals instead of using the company expense account. However, Tokyo's fine dining scene is notoriously inaccessible to foreign visitors, as most establishments do not accept reservations from new customers; you will need to be introduced by one of their regular diners in order to dine there. That said, it is possible to book a spot at some of these establishments through your hotel concierge if you do so many months in advance, though only the most expensive luxury hotels will have the necessary clout to do this. Also keep in mind that many fine dining establishments do not accept credit cards, and you will be expected to pay for your meal in cash.\nThere are four 3-star sushi restaurants in Tokyo, of which the most famous internationally is Sukiyabashi Jiro, due to the movie Jiro Dreams of Sushi; reservations must be made on the 1st day of the preceding month, as they book up that day, and dinner is from \u00a530,000. The cheapest of these top sushi restaurants is Sait\u014d Sushi (+81 3 3589 4412), where a small lunch can be had for as little as \u00a55,000.\n\n\n== Drink ==\n\nThe party never stops in Tokyo (at least in the karaoke bars), and you will find good little bars and restaurants everywhere.\nThe most Japanese way to spend a night out as an individual or in a small group would be at Japanese-style watering holes called izakaya (\u5c45\u9152\u5c4b), which offer food and drink in a convivial, pub-like atmosphere (see Japan for details). Cheaper chain izakaya like Tsubohachi (\u3064\u307c\u516b) and Shirokiya (\u767d\u6728\u5c4b) usually have picture menus, so ordering is simple, even if you don't know Japanese \u2013 but don't be surprised if some places have Japanese only touchscreen ordering systems.\nAnother common option, which is often unbelievable to non-Japanese ears, is \u201call you can drink\u201d (nomih\u014ddai, \u98f2\u307f\u653e\u984c), where you can drink all you want from a fixed menu for 90 minutes or 120 minutes. This is aimed at group parties, and is generally paired with a meal, often \u201call you can eat\u201d (tabeh\u014ddai, \u98df\u3079\u653e\u984c), often in a private room. Receiving the items ordered will depend on how often your servers decide to bring out these items, which means you may be \"throttled\" to an extent, and may feel less than a true \"all you can drink/eat\" experience. This depends on the establishment. There are also a number of cheap bars where you can get a drink for \u00a5300 or even cheaper.\nTokyo's most distinctive drink is Hoppy (hoppi, \u30db\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc), a virtually non-alcoholic beer-flavored drink (0.8% alcohol), which is drunk by mixing with sh\u014dch\u016b (at 25%) at a 5:1 ratio, yielding an about 5% alcohol drink, essentially a substitute beer. This is available in older izakaya and has experienced a retro revival of late, though it is not particularly tasty. Another distinctively Tokyo drink is Denki Bran (\u96fb\u6c17\u30d6\u30e9\u30f3, \u201celectric brandy\u201d), a herb-flavored brandy available (to drink in or in bottles) at the Kamiya bar (\u795e\u8c37\u30d0\u30fc) in Asakusa, right at the main intersection by the metro station.\nThe major brands of beer are widely available, typically \u00a5500\u2013800 per glass or bottle, but microbrews and foreign beer are only rarely available and often very expensive. You're generally better off getting bottles of microbrews at speciality stores. Popeye in Ry\u014dgoku is a rare exception, with 70 beers on tap! Another popular choice is Beer Station at Ebisu, serving a variety of Yebisu beers and matching German food.\nFor a splurge on a beverage or two, Western Shinjuku's Park Hyatt Tokyo houses the New York Bar on level 52. Providing stunning views day and night across Tokyo, it was also the setting for the movie Lost in Translation. Cocktails here start around \u00a51400 \u2013 single malt whiskies are upwards of \u00a52000. Amazing cocktails, served in \u201ctasting flights\u201d of 4 or 6 drinks, are made by Gen Yamamoto at his bar in Azabu-J\u016bban, at about \u00a56000 for 6 drinks (a la carte cocktails are available in larger pours for \u00a51600\u20131800).\nVisiting clubs and western-style night spots can get expensive, with clubs and live houses enforcing weekend cover charges in the \u00a52000\u20135000 bracket (usually including a drink coupon or two).\nIf you're new in town, Roppongi has establishments which specialize in serving foreigners \u2013 but it's also overflowing with foreigners, hostesses, and 'patrons' who will continually hassle you to visit their gentlemen's clubs, where drinks cost \u00a55000 and up. Many Japanese and foreigners avoid this area, preferring the clubs and bars in Shibuya instead, or trendy Ginza, Ebisu, Shinjuku or Ikebukuro.\nHUB and 82 Ale House, a chain of British-style cash-on-delivery pubs, has branches near most major stations and is reasonably priced and popular among foreigners and Japanese alike. Other British/Irish pubs can be found in Roppongi, Shinjuku and Shibuya. Expect to pay around \u00a51000 a pint, although happy hours can reduce this by a few hundred yen.\nIn Shibuya, the bar area behind 109 and next to Dogenzaka (\"Love Hotel Hill\") has a large number of clubs. Unlike those in Roppongi, these clubs have entrance fees, but clubs without entrance fees often hassle you all night to buy drinks which ends up just as expensive and without people who are actually there to enjoy the music. Shinjuku is home to Kabukich\u014d, Japan's largest red-light district. Also in Shinjuku is the gay bar district of Shinjuku-nichome. A little further from the city center are Shimokitazawa, Koenji and Nakano, full of good bars, restaurants and \"live houses\" offering underground/indie music popular with students and 20/30-somethings. \nTaito is where Yoshiwara, the infamous red-light district of feudal Edo, was located. However, it is today a shadow of its former self as most of the sex trade has shifted elsewhere, and all that remains is a few soaplands (brothels disguised as bathhouses).\n\n\n== Sleep ==\nThere are thousands of hotels in the Tokyo area, ranging from cheap to very expensive. They are distributed throughout the city, with some of the high end and the low end almost everywhere. Many Western-style hotels, especially those affiliated with American hotel chains, have English-speaking staff.\nFor long-term accommodation, be prepared to splurge as Tokyo's real estate prices are among the highest in the world, and apartments in the area are typically very cramped. Many locals actually live in the neighbouring cities and commute to Tokyo for work every day due to the astronomical rents in Tokyo, and one-way commuting times can often last more than 2 hours.\n\n\n=== Budget ===\nMuch of Tokyo's budget accommodation can be found in the Taito area, especially Asakusa and Ueno. But if you are not afraid of being a little bit off-center, you may have a look to the surroundings: Yokohama, etc.\nMost of the cheap accommodation in the Taito area (near JR Minami-senjuu) has curfew times around 22:00 to 23:00, so be sure to check that in advance if it bothers you. One hotel that does not have a curfew is Kangaroo Hotel, rooms starting at \u00a53200. There's also Economy Hotel Hoteiya, rooms starting at \u00a52700.\nCapsule hotels are generally the cheapest option. They may be reluctant to play host to foreigners as there are quite a few rules of behavior which may be difficult to explain; see the Japan article for the full scoop. Most capsule hotels are men-only. Akihabara Capsule Inn is among the very few to have women-only floors.\n24-hour comic book library/internet cafes known as manga kissa, are common in Tokyo. This is one of the cheapest ways to crash if you miss your last train and need to wait for the early morning transit service to get started. No bed, but you have a comfy chair and a PC and/or DVDs if you can't sleep. Later in the evening, karaoke boxes often offer discounted prices for the whole night, they usually have a couch you can sleep on. Most of these cyber cafes charge \u00a51500\u20132500 for 8 hours.\nOne of the cheapest ways to stay can be also a youth hostel, prices start at \u00a51200, e.g. in the Shinjuku area.\nIf you are truly on a budget, it is possible to go homeless and camp in public parks, for free. You can do this with a tent, if you want to carry one, and you can also sleep on benches, as exhausted salarymen and students do. It's also possible to do this all over Japan, It's called nojuku in Japanese.\n\n\n=== Mid-range ===\nThere is a wide range of choices in hotels while at Tokyo, most of the hotels are rated 3 stars or more. Tokyo is among most of the other cities when it comes to hotels because their services and hotel locations are the best of the best.\nKeep an eye out for what is called a business hotel. The rooms are usually tiny, but they are near stations and rates start from around \u00a56000. Staff may speak minimal English, but it's not too hard to figure out. These are the best options for solo travelers. Affordable chains found throughout Tokyo include Tokyu Stay, which offers free internet access and breakfast, Toyoko Inn, Chisun and Sunroute.\nTokyo has some self-proclaimed ryokan (Japanese inns) that cater largely to foreign tourists, mostly concentrated around Ueno and Asakusa. While not as opulent as the real thing, they offer a sample of Japanese home life at affordable rates.\nJapan's infamous love hotels can be a reasonable (and interesting) option in Tokyo. Shibuya's Dogenzaka (\"Love Hotel Hill\") offers the widest selection in the city. If you're really going to spend the night, be sure to check in for a \"stay\" rather than a \"rest\". Be warned that some love hotels (at least around Shinjuku) have a 'No Japanese, no stay' policy, presumably to avoid confusion over billing; others lock you into your room until you pay into a slot by the door to leave.\n\n\n=== Splurge ===\n\nYou can spend a fortune on accommodation in Tokyo. Most of the high-end international chains are well represented. Particular concentrations of luxury hotels can be found in western Shinjuku (including the Park Hyatt Tokyo, featured in Lost in Translation), near Tokyo Station and Marunouchi (including the legendary Imperial Hotel) and in Akasaka.\nBeware of hotels marketing themselves as being at \"Tokyo Bay\". At best, this means you'll be in or near the Odaiba district, built on reclaimed land half an hour away from the city center; at worst, you'll end up somewhere on the coast of the adjacent prefecture of Chiba, which is handy for visiting Tokyo Disneyland but quite inconvenient for touring Tokyo itself.\n\n\n== Connect ==\n\n\n=== Free Wifi ===\nTokyo Metro About 100 metro (not JR) stations have free Wi-Fi, with SSID \"Metro_Free_Wi-Fi\" or \"Toei_Subway_Free_Wi-Fi\", email registration necessary.\nFreeSpot FreeSpot offering free wireless Internet access, check out their maps of service areas\nJapan Wi-Fi auto-connect app for free Wi-Fi spots all over Japan.\n\n\n=== Internet cafe ===\nGood connections are available at Internet cafes everywhere. Expect to pay \u00a5400\u2013500 per hour. \"Gera Gera\" is a popular chain. Paid WiFi service is also taking off in Tokyo with reasonable coverage \u2013 at a price. WiFi services are probably not convenient for those just visiting.\nIt is possible to find wireless connections in fast food outlets like McDonald's or Mos Burger. You also have a good chance to find a connection in one of the numerous coffee shops. Just look for a wireless connection sign in the front window or computers within the shop. Free wireless is not nearly as prevalent in Japan as it is in the West.\n\n\n=== Mobile phones ===\nForeigners are forbidden from buying disposable \"burner\" mobile phones and SIM cards, but it is possible to rent mobile phones, SIM Cards, and portable wifi hotspots.\n\nRentafone Japan Rents basic mobile phones with texting, calling, and mobile internet service.\neConnect Rents \"WiFi-To-Go\" mobile hot spots, for \u00a5 432 - 1,080 / day and prepaid data-only SIM Cards lasting as long as 30 days.\n\n\n== Stay safe ==\nTokyo is probably one of the safest cities you will ever visit, and Japan in general is one of the safest countries in the world. Most people, including female travellers, would not encounter any problems walking along the streets alone at night. Street crime is extremely rare, even late at night. However, \"little crime\" does not mean \"no crime\", and common sense should still be applied as anywhere in the world. Often the biggest risk is travellers taking Japan's visibly apparent lack of crime too close to heart and doing things they would never do back home.\nThe most common crime is sexual harassment on crowded trains, pressed up against each other, hands wander. This is more of a local problem as westerners are considered more aggressive and would stick up for themselves. The best way to deal with any wandering hands is to yell \"Chikan!\" which is the Japanese term for \"pervert\". There are railway police offices inside major railway stations in Tokyo, and their locations can be found here. You may alternatively dial the police at \u260f +81-03-3581-4321 to report sexual harassment.\nTokyo's main slum area is the San'ya (\u5c71\u8c37) area, near Minami-Senju station, with large numbers of mostly male homeless people. It is well off the main tourist trail, but has been gaining popularity among backpackers for its cheap accommodation. However, as many of these hostels are designed for homeless day labourers, the hygiene conditions are often less than satisfactory. While violent crime is still rare, sexual harassment of women is more common than elsewhere in Tokyo, so women might want to avoid travelling there alone.\nSmall police stations, or k\u014dban (\u4ea4\u756a), can be found every few blocks, and provide community policing. If you get lost or need assistance, by all means go to them; it's their job to help you! They have great maps of the surrounding area, and are happy to give directions. They may, however, have difficulties with English, so some knowledge of the Japanese language helps. Staffing of k\u014dbans is usually limited, and should you need to report a crime, you should lodge them at your nearest police station (\u8b66\u5bdf\u7f72), which are marked with a circle with a cross on maps and signs.\nTake usual precautions against pickpockets in crowded areas and trains. Also, theft is more likely to occur in hangouts and bars popular with travellers and non-residents.\nThe red-light and nightlife districts can be a bit seedy, but are rarely dangerous. Some small, back-street drinking establishments in red-light districts have been known to charge extortionate prices. Similar problems exist in the seedier clubs in Roppongi, where it may be wise to check cover charges and drink prices in advance. Never follow touts, as they are likely to lead you to dodgy establishments that charge extortionate prices. Touting is illegal in Japan, so you can call the police if they get persistent.\nStill in a jam? Call Tokyo English Life Line, tel. 03-5774-0992, daily 09:00-23:00.\nIf you make it as far out as the Izu Islands, visitors to Miyakejima Island are required to carry a gas mask, due to volcanic gases. Those in poor health are advised against travelling to the island. In addition, Tokyo, like the rest of Japan is at risk for earthquakes.\n\n\n== Cope ==\n\n\n=== Addresses ===\nIn Tokyo, like other Japanese cities, a place's address is nearly useless for actually getting there. Most roads have no name. Addresses are written in order from largest to smallest; an example address written as \u4e38\u30ce\u51851\u4e01\u76ee5-6 or \u4e38\u30ce\u51851-5-6 would be the neighborhood of Marunouchi (\u4e38\u30ce\u5185), district (ch\u014dme) 1, block 5, house 6. (Addresses are usually written in English as \"Marunouchi 1-5-6\", or \"1-5-6 Marunouchi\".) Additional numbers may be appended for the floor or room number.\nNumbering for districts, blocks, and houses is often not sequential; numbers are usually assigned as buildings are built, chronologically, or based on distance from the city center. Small signs near street corners display the ward/neighborhood and district in Japanese (such as \u4e38\u30ce\u51851\u4e01\u76ee, Marunouchi 1-ch\u014dme); they often include the block number, but sometimes not, in which case the signs are very unhelpful since a district could be a dozen or more blocks. A building's entrance will usually show the block and house number (such as 5\u20136, sometimes written 5\u756a6\u53f7), but not the district.\nTo find your address, make your way to the ward, then start looking for the signs near street corners. The ch\u014dmes may be numbered in a logical way \u2014 ch\u014dme 4 next to ch\u014dme 3, or they may not be. Once you locate the correct ch\u014dme, start looking for your block. Again, block 5 may be close to block 4. Then walk around the block looking for building 6. Ganbatte! (Do your best and good luck.)\n\n\n=== Healthcare centres ===\n Tokyo Metropolitan Health and Medical Information Center, \u260f +81 3-5285-8181. 09:00-20:00. Information about medical institutions as well as about the medical and health insurance system in Japan. (English/Chinese/Korean/Thai/Spanish). \n Emergency Translation Services (for Medical Institutions), \u260f +81 3-5285-8185. Weekdays:17:00-20:00, Weekends and Holidays:09:00-20:00. It's a service used by doctors, not by travelers. But, if doctor doesn't speak English, you may want to tell him or her about this service so he or she can see you more smoothly. (English/Chinese/Korean/Thai/Spanish). \n\n\n=== Babysitting ===\n chezvous. \n Kinder-Network, \u260f +81 3-6415-8271, info@kinder-network.com. \n Babysitters, \u260f +81 45-507-1888, info@babysitters.jp. \n\n\n=== Accessibility ===\nTokyo is the most accessible city in Japan with over 90% of the train stations being wheelchair accessible, along with most tourist attractions. Crowding on trains can be difficult for some people, but wheelchair spaces are available.\nFinding accessible restaurants can be hard to access since they often have steps or are very small. Department stores often have accessible restaurants on the top floors.\n\nAccessible Japan - general information, list of hotels with accessible rooms, tourist attractions\nJapan Guide: Basic Guide to Accessible Travel in Japan - general info\n\n\n=== Embassies ===\n\n\n== Go next ==\nFrom Tokyo, the entire surrounding Kanto region is your oyster. Particularly popular destinations nearby include:\n\nHakone \u2014 for hot springs and views of Mount Fuji, Ashinoko Lake.\nKawagoe \u2014 Old historical town also called \"Little Edo\". Its main street and castle can take you back in time. 60 min train ride from Tokyo station.\nKamakura \u2014 home to dozens of small temples and one Big Buddha, once the seat of the Kamakura shogunate.\nNikko \u2014 grandiose shrine and burial site of Shogun Tokugawa Iemitsu\nOdawara \u2014 houses the only Japanese castle in greater Tokyo area\nYugawara, Manazuru \u2014 for hot springs and coastal resort, eating sashimi and mikan, views of Manazuru Peninsula, some festivals (Matsuri).\nTokyo Disney Resort \u2014 with Tokyo Disneyland (just like the ones everywhere else) and Tokyo Disney Sea (an only-in-Japan theme park which includes some unique rides and some imported rides from Disney parks outside of Japan)\nYokohama \u2014 Japan's second-largest city and a suburb of Tokyo\nThe Tokyo area also has some less-famous destinations that are easy day trips from central Tokyo:\n\nAshikaga \u2014 historical hometown of a famous shogun clan, first school in Japan, top flower park in Japan, and beautiful nature\nKiryu \u2014 famous historical silk town with museums and bountiful nature for hiking and cycling lovers looking to get a taste of small town Japan\nHachioji \u2014 a refreshing climb up Mt.

        "title": "Boston",
        "extract": "A city of history and tradition, Boston offers a proud legacy of culture, education, and numerous sporting championships. The \"shining city on a hill\"s independent spirit has been displayed to the world ever since colonists were angry over a British tax on their beloved tea and dumped shiploads of it into the harbor in protest.\nIn the early 1600s, the peninsula in Massachusetts that would become known as Boston was controlled by Native Americans until John Smith (English soldier, explorer, colonial governor, Admiral of New England, and author) named the area New England to attract European settlers. Boston was founded in 1630 by John Winthrop, making it one of the oldest cities in the U.S.\nNo other American city has made more of an effort to preserve its history, and you'll find buildings that pre-date the republic dotted throughout the region. But Boston isn't a city to dwell on the past: it has renovated and revitalized, in the process shedding its once deservedly parochial reputation. And its culture is refreshed every fall by an influx of freshmen pouring into its constellation of powerful universities, which attract great minds from around the globe.\nVisiting will reveal a distinct mix of puritanical ideals and liberal politics\u2014the former responsible for the first public school in the Americas, the latter spurring Massachusetts to become the first U.S. state to legalize same-sex marriage. Don't believe everything you've heard about the gruff demeanor of locals. Bostonians are often friendlier than the unacquainted might expect...just don't call it \"Beantown\" to their face.\n\n\n== Districts ==\nGreater Boston is notoriously provincial, and as such, the surrounding area contains hundreds of small communities that are closer knit than is common elsewhere in the United States. Even a large city like Boston found it difficult to annex surrounding areas as it grew. When independent towns were absorbed, they retained their unique culture, which modern residents remain fiercely proud of today. What does this mean for the traveller? You'll find most every district goes by more than one name, with a full count exceeding 110 distinct squares, circles, and points. Don't worry about remembering all the names; just remember Boston is a very compact city. When you're ready to move on, the next block is bound to engage.\n\nMany sights visitors expect to see are not within the city limits. Politically distinct from Boston, the following three cities are bound together with Boston by their shared borders, transit options, and cultural values. The mayors meet often to plan and discuss long-term developments, and citizens travel between them daily. Casual visitors may not realize they are leaving Boston at all.\n\nCambridge: \"The People's Republic of Cambridge\" is most famous for the prestigious Harvard University and MIT. Many stunning museums, architecture, and events belonging to these schools are well worth a visit. Cambridge also has The Longfellow House among other colonial sites.\nSomerville: Though this is a mostly residential neighborhood, you may find yourself here nonetheless exploring the many restaurants and quirky shops in Davis Square. In the warmer months, independent musicians and artists hold festivals, overtaking Union Square and beyond.\nBrookline: The greenest neighborhood by far, Brookline is home to Frederick Law Olmsted's Fairsted, the first landscape design office. The Larz Anderson Park and Auto Museum is also nearby. Additionally many shopping and dining options can be found in Coolidge Corner and Washington Square.\n\n\n== Understand ==\n\n\n=== History ===\nThe first people to arrive here discovered an archipelago of islands and isthmuses, filled with fruits of the land and sea. They called the land Shawmut, and would use fishweirs and tidal flows to catch their dinners. Calling themselves Massachusett, meaning \"people of the great hills\" they chased the seasons, heading inland to hunker down in winter hunting camps, while fishing and foraging by the coast during summer. These eponymous great hills are today known as the Blue Hills, and are in nearby Milton.\n\n\n==== Founding ====\nThe first European immigrant to appear was William Blaxton, an English priest who began living alone atop Beacon Hill in 1629. The following year the flagship Arbella and her fleet sailed from England, bringing hundreds of Puritan families across the Atlantic. Designated governor by the Massachusetts Bay Colony, John Winthrop quickly acquired Blaxton's land. He dubbed the area Boston after his boyhood home. Winthrop then delivered a powerful speech to his fellow settlers\u2014one of the first examples of American Exceptionalism\u2014proclaiming Boston to be \"as a city upon a hill\". This sermon would inspire those seeking to live life as \"a model of Christian charity\", and over the next decade close to 10,000 additional Puritans would reach the colony.\nDiffering somewhat from the English, the new Puritan arrivals to Boston placed an extreme value on literacy. Legislation was drafted during town meetings, requiring residents to be able to read and understand the Bible and the laws of the land. Boston Latin School and Harvard College were established early on as means to that end. This early commitment to education and system of small town governance are values that continue to endure throughout the Commonwealth of Massachusetts today.\nWhile forward thinking in some ways, Puritans were exceedingly intolerant in other aspects of life. Anne Hutchinson, a charismatic Puritan, was banished and excommunicated in 1637 for her strong anti-establishment religious convictions. Mary Dyer was less fortunate, and in 1660 was hanged in Boston Common for the \"crime\" of being a Quaker. And yes, Christmas celebrations really were banned in Boston from 1659-1681 for being \"satanical\" and \"sacrilegious\".\nOver the following 100 years, the New England colonists would war with remaining native Indian tribes, suffer deadly bouts of smallpox, and choose to rebuild after devastating fires and earthquakes. When in 1691 the colony expanded into the Province of Massachusetts Bay, Boston remained the capital of the region. Its position as the closest American city to England coupled with a high birth rate ushered in a boom time for the population and the economy.\n\n\n==== Revolution ====\nIn direct competition with New York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore, Boston spent years improving its infrastructure. Investing in wharves, storage, and lighthouses helped Boston to become one of the world's wealthiest port cities. The trade in slaves, rum, salted cod, and tobacco were particularly important over the years. When, in the mid-1760s, taxes were levied on items Bostonians held most dear, the colonists' shared experiences and common religious background fostered a resistance unexpected to the far-off British Parliament.\nResistance came to a boiling point on March 5, 1770 when Redcoats fired into a crowd of colonists, shooting Crispus Attucks and four others dead by the steps of the Old State House. An illustration by Paul Revere of what would become known as The Boston Massacre called American colonists up and down the coast to throw off the yoke of colonial oppression. On the night of April 18, 1775, Revere rode out of Boston famously yelling: \"The British are coming, the British are coming!\", helping to raise the alarm of British attack throughout the countryside. After victories at Lexington and Concord, General George Washington arrived on the scene to help the Continental Army break the siege of Boston. The British were finally expelled in 1776, when after an overnight flurry of activity, cannons were fortified atop a hill and trained on the Crown's ships. For these pivotal events in American history, Boston is often referred to as The Cradle of Liberty.\n\n\n==== 19th century ====\nNow unencumbered by a foreign power and boasting a successful economy, Boston grew quickly, becoming a city in 1822. An elite class of community leaders developed, calling themselves Boston Brahmins. Families with the names Delano, Revere and Adams would prize the arts and became widely known for their rarefied literary culture and lavish patronage. Other contemporary Bostonians such as the famous writer Ralph Waldo Emerson, no less privileged but with an alternative outlook on life, called themselves Transcendentalists. They believed in the inherent goodness of people and nature.\nThese groups would work together with Abolitionists to shape American liberal thought throughout the century. Calling Boston \"The Athens of America\", they helped drive unprecedented scientific, educational and social change that would soon sweep the country. Bostonians still think of the city as Brahmin Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. once put it, \"The Hub of the Universe\". This half-serious term is all you need to know to understand Boston's complicated self-image.\nOne of the most visible historical events to shape the city of Boston was the Irish potato famine during the late 1840s. A massive number of Irish escaped their homeland and found quarters in a new city. \"The Boston Irish\" would go on to reshape the city, building Catholic Boston College and giving birth to a powerful political dynasty, the Kennedys. Even the local basketball team is named \"The Celtics\". Today, imagining the city of Boston without the Irish is an impossible task.\nImmigrants kept on arriving throughout the 1800s, not only from Ireland, but from Italy, eastern Europe, and beyond. The city needed space to put them all, so it began annexing nearby towns and undertaking land reclamation projects. Boston would eventually grow to become over 40 times its original size! Boston's economy would continue to expand along with its landmass, but not as quickly, and profits would not be distributed evenly.\n\n\n==== Modern ====\n\nBy the close of World War II, Boston was on the decline. Poorly thought out urban renewal policies demolished hundreds of acres of ethnic neighborhoods. Factories were closing, no large buildings were under construction, and anti-Jewish and anti-black violence was on the rise. A court order forced Boston Public Schools to integrate, flaring racial tensions throughout the city. White flight was in full swing, as wealthier white Bostonians fled the city. A widely circulated photograph, The Soiling of Old Glory, depicted a young white student thrusting a flagpole at a restrained black man, reinforcing Boston's reputation for discrimination. But there were seeds of hope planted during the 1970s as well.\nAs the market began to open up in the 1970s, Boston did well in the mutual fund and financial industries. The healthcare sector grew, and many hospitals in Boston began to lead the nation in medical innovation and patient care. Higher education also became more expensive, and the best and brightest were attracted to Boston's powerful universities. Graduates from MIT in particular founded many profitable high-tech and bio-tech companies.\nAfter the completion of the Big Dig in 2007, Boston began to step back into the spotlight on the national stage. Racial tensions have eased dramatically, and city streets once again echo with the sounds of activity and construction not seen for decades. Other cities look to Boston for how they handle health care, police violence, and civil rights issues. In the new millennium Boston is once again becoming a \"hub\" of intellectual, technological, and political thought.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nAlmost any time of the year is a good time to visit Boston. June to September is the height of the tourist season. Every corner of the city takes advantage of the warm weather and is packed with festivals and special events. While it is further north than other US cities, Boston is no stranger to the summer heat and humidity experienced by cities further south. Generally, summer heat indices average around 83 \u00b0F (28 \u00b0C) during the day and 67 \u00b0F (19 \u00b0C) at night; but from time to time, there are some instances each summer with daytime highs near 91 \u00b0F (33 \u00b0C) alongside dewpoints and overnight lows around 74 \u00b0F (23 \u00b0C) for a few days. These uncommon instances can cause outdoor activities you do at the height of an exceptionally sweltering summer day to leave you drenched in sweat, as heat indices can climb upwards to 97 \u00b0F (36 \u00b0C) or even surpass it, but these sweltering periods generally pass after no more than a few days. There are still regularly summer days where temperatures are more moderate and comfortable with daytime temperatures around 80 \u00b0F (27 \u00b0C). These are more common especially in the early part of summer when the sea breeze kicks in; and as August rolls into September.\nThe springtime offers a window into renewal. Especially during May, blooms and blossoms are out and colors are at their brightest. Daylight in the late spring and early summer months lasts from 5AM to 8PM. During fall, Mother Nature is on full display. She puts on such a show during October and November, many visitors choose this time to holiday over all others. If you are a snow lover, winter could be the season for you. Most residents, however, dread the cold temps and scant daylight hours found from December through March, sometimes extending into April.\nAlthough far north for an American city, the nearby Atlantic Ocean offers a moderating effect. Winters are slow to take hold, while conversely, spring is slow to take root. One thing about the North Atlantic, it never really gets warm. Never. No matter how hot it is at the beach, you can bet that ocean water will be cold! The Atlantic also has the unlikely potential to create a Nor'easter, kind of a less powerful hurricane. Nor'easter's generally happen from September to April, when the cold Arctic air meets with warmer air over the Atlantic; and hurricanes can come close to hitting Boston in the late summer each year. Boston might get anywhere from 0-2 of these events a year, and is well prepared for them. So just hunker down for the day while the windy deluge passes by.\nWhen the snow comes, and it has come, it alters the rhythm of life in the city. Sidewalks become slippery and narrow. Daylight starts at 7AM, only for the sun to set at 4PM. The mercury drops below freezing and can stay there for weeks. It can dip even lower to 0\u00b0F (-18\u00b0C). There are periods each winter where warm Caribbean air pushes up into the Bay State, bringing with it a much welcomed respite from the cold. This helps keep the snow from piling up, so seeing more than a foot of accumulation is rare. The 2014\u201315 winter was an incredible exception, when over 110 in (2,800 mm) of snow fell on Boston in 18 days. The city dumped it in piles as high as 75 ft (23 m), and had to wait until July 14th for the last of it to finally melt away. Boston is not well equipped to handle snowfall to that degree, so expect similar extensive transit disruptions if that amount ever drops again. The trend has started to change, however, with the winters of 2022-23 and 2023-24 seeing very little snow at all, and daytime temperatures only went below freezing for only a few days during the entire season.\n\n\n=== Watch ===\n\nGood Will Hunting (Gus Van Sant, 1996). If you're only watching one movie about Boston, make it this one. While the tale of Romeo & Juliet has been told many times, this telling of star crossed \"blue collar\" and \"ivory tower\" lovers could only happen in Boston. A powerful Academy Award winning performance by Robin Williams and quotable dialogue make this a standout film. Good Will Hunting was a breakout success for Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, and you'll hear some great accents and see the city as it was before the current building boom. How you like them apples?!\nThe Departed (Martin Scorsese, 2006). Loosely based on the exploits of Irish mobster Whitey Bulger and corrupt FBI agent John Connolly. This star studded tale of murder and deception starring Matt Damon, Leonardo Di Caprio and Jack Nicholson won four Oscars including best picture. For a more biographical take on the mobster, don't miss Black Mass directed by Scott Cooper in 2015.\nGlory (Edward Zwick, 1989). Among other sources, Glory is based on the personal letters of Colonel Robert Gould Shaw, commander of the first all-black regiment during the Civil War. OK, so there's a bit of a White savior thing going on, and it's not set in Boston; but still it's a great film and accurately depicts the feelings many Bostonians had about slavery during this time.\nMystic River (Clint Eastwood, 2003). This critically acclaimed film deals with the horrific fallout of child abuse, rampant in Boston during the 1970s. Exploring where people's loyalties really lie, and asking how far you would go to protect what is yours. Principal photography took place on location in Boston.\nThe Town (Ben Affleck, 2010) If the grittier side of Boston intrigues you, this crime thriller by Boston's own Ben Affleck will give you an insight in many of the city's unsavory and blue-collar environments, peppered with wicked thick Boston accents.\nTed (Seth MacFarlane, 2012). On the lighter side, this hilarious buddy comedy features all the toilet humor and Boston accents you can shake a stick at. Fenway Park of course gets involved somehow, along with a few original (off-color) songs.\nSpotlight (Tom McCarthy, 2015). Following The Boston Globe's \"Spotlight\" team, this film pursues the investigation into cases of widespread and systemic child sex abuse in the Boston area by numerous Roman Catholic priests. Based on a series of stories that earned The Globe a Pulitzer Prize in 2003.\nPatriots Day (Peter Berg, 2016). Shot in Boston and Quincy, Patriot's Day deals with the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing and the subsequent terrorist manhunt. While the film was well received, it was criticized in Boston for being made too soon and glamorizing the events it was based upon.\n\n\n=== Read ===\nOften, Boston isn't at the center of a novel, but repeatedly makes memorable cameo appearances. Perhaps owing to the academic magnet effect that attracts bright minds here for a few short years. See David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest or Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury for examples. Another masterwork, The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood, is also set in Boston.\n\nThe Scarlet Letter (Nathaniel Hawthorne, 1850). Exploring themes of legalism, sin, and guilt; the book tells the tale of Hester Prynne, who conceives a daughter through an affair and struggles to create a new life in 17th century Boston.\nThe Bell Jar (Sylvia Plath, 1963). Esther Greenwood is a young woman from the suburbs of Boston who experiences a series of setbacks and struggles with depression as she struggles to choose between doing what's expected or what is in her heart. Semi-autobiographical.\nCommon Ground (J. Anthony Lukas, 1985). Winning the Pulitzer Prize for general non-fiction, this novel follows the lives of three families as they experience race relations in Boston during the 1960s and 70s. It briefly recounts how each family came to live in their neighborhood before narrowing in on racial and class conflicts.\nThe Rascal King (Jack Beatty, 2000). Hero or hooligan? Boston mayor James Michael Curley (1874-1958) could certainly be either. During his four terms he built schools, playgrounds and beaches; even while imprisoned under a fraud conviction.\nDark Tide (Stephen Puleo, 2003). In this book Puelo seeks to uncover the structural reasons for the occurrence of the great Boston molasses flood of 1919. See this infobox for more.\nA Short History of Boston (Robert Allison, 2004). The chair of Suffolk University\u2019s history department brings Boston's history alive in 128 pages. Covering everything from the Puritan theocracy to the Big Dig and beyond.\nAnother Bullshit Night in Suck City (Nick Flynn, 2004). A memoir by playwright and poet Nick Flynn, describing his reunion with his estranged father, Jonathan, an alcoholic resident of the homeless shelter where Nick was a social worker in the late 1980s.\nThe Given Day (Dennis Lehane, 2008). A historical novel set in Boston during the turn of the last century. One of the story's main characters is Aiden \"Danny\" Coughlin, an ethnic Irish Boston Police patrolman. Lehane is also the author of other Boston based books frequently turned into films. You may have heard of Shutter Island, Gone, Baby, Gone, Mystic River, and many others.\nThe Gardner Heist (Ulrich Boser, 2009). On the night of March 18, 1990 two men committed the largest art theft in history. A dozen masterpieces worth over $500 million went missing, and remain at large today. See this infobox for more.\n\n\n=== Tourist information ===\nBoston tourism website\n\n\n== Talk ==\nOften used in film and television as shorthand for \"blue-collar\" or \"working-class\" stereotypes, the Boston accent remains mostly alive and well in the region. Known for dropping \"R\"s, the accent is believed to be a continuation of the English accent imported by the first colonists. Today, however, it's on life support within the city itself, as long-time residents move out and younger transplants from around the country and world move in. Listen in to conversations of police, fire or construction workers for your best chance to hear it in the city. If you have time, pay a visit to the north or south shore, where you're much more likely to hear it in action.\nThough they have mostly eschewed the Boston accent, younger Boston residents do pepper their speech with a plethora of local lingo, with \"wicked\" being particularly popular. Also, young people in Massachusetts (and New England for that matter) tend to speak a lot faster than other Americans.\nThe word \"wicked\" is still strongly in use, functioning as an amplifier in place of \"very\". You'll also hear \"packie\" for a liquor (package) store and \"blinkers\" for the turn signals on your car. And some of our English friends might recognize a \"rotary\" as a roundabout. There are many others, but these are the most commonly used today. Feel free to try out \"wicked\" as often as you like, it's a fun way to get in on the culture. Try not to go overboard \u2014 saying stuff like \"Pahk tha cah in Hahvid Yahd\" is a dead giveaway for tourists. Avoid saying \"pisser\" \u2014 you'll see it printed on t-shirts but no one really says it anymore.\nHosting a very large Hispanic population, Boston can be a great place to practice your Spanish.\n\n\n=== Visitor information ===\n Greater Boston Convention & Visitors Bureau, \u260f +1 617-536-4100, toll-free: +1-888-733-2678, info@bostonusa.com.

It's modern, clean, easy to navigate, and the primary gateway to Boston and New England. Logan has a bevy of dining options scattered throughout its terminals, some of them are even good! Nowadays it's possible to find local farm-to-table fare and a wide selection of organic microbrews on tap. Of course this is America after all, so you can bet a McDonald's or Sbarro will never be out of sight. For shopping, you'll easily be able to find a new book or magazine once past security. You could also buy fancy new shoes, headphones, or a hundred other things. \nAs the major airport for New England, Logan provides frequent non-stop service to most major cities in the United States and almost all major European airports. Logan airport serves as a focus city for JetBlue and as a hub for Delta Air Lines, while American Airlines is another major carrier. The regional airline Cape Air and commuter airline PenAir also make Logan their base of operations. Flights tend to be on time, but you never know with that wild New England weather. Try not to plan your connections too tightly. Security is typically tight, like at most major American airports, and you can expect the TSA to be thorough, efficient, and quick.\n\n\n==== Ground transportation ====\nAll terminals in Logan are directly connected to the central parking garage like spokes on a hub. Terminals A and B are fairly close together, and it's possible to walk from C to E. Above-ground enclosed walkways connect all terminals, while free MassPort shuttle buses connect all airport services. Shuttle #11 loops around and quickly connects the four terminals together. Shuttle #22 and #33 connect the subway and rental car center, with terminals A&B and C&E respectively. Shuttle #55 runs during off-peak hours and connects everything, and the #66 shuttle adds the water transportation dock into the mix as well. Finally, shuttle #88 connects all terminals to the economy parking garage. If you're renting a car, take one of the shuttles and don't wait for a branded company van.\nThe MassPort shuttles will connect you to Airport Station, where you can switch to the Blue line. For most travellers, however, the best option is to board the Silver line for free at Logan and transfer for free to the Red line. The Silver line whisks you straight from your terminal to South Station downtown. Transfers to other lines will also be gratis, but try to pick up a Charliecard at South Station if you plan on riding the T again. Service stops around 12:30AM, so if your flight arrives after this you'll be taking a cab.\nTaxis are more expensive in Boston than in many other cities. Fortunately though, the airport is quite close to downtown. Costs could range from $25-50, depending on your final destination. There is no one livery for Boston taxis, although they are predominantly white (hence the local name \"White Cabs\"). Cab models will also vary, with Ford Crown Victorias and Toyota Camry hybrids being the most common. Ride-hailing services such as Uber and Lyft can pick up and drop off at Logan. In March 2019, the airport said that it is planning to move all pickups and drop offs to the ground floor of the Central Garage, so check before you depart.\nCheck with your hotel about airport shuttle service, it's an amenity offered by many. Other shuttle services that visit the airport include:\n\n  Logan Express. Offers direct bus service from Braintree, Framingham, Woburn, and Peabody. Buses leave every hour or so and trips take around 30-45 minutes. Express buses also run to the airport from Copley Square and Hynes Convention Center in the Back Bay. Between $3 and $9 to airport, Free returns. (updated Jan 2024)\n Axis Coach, \u260f +1 617 340-3403. Airport limos to and from Logan airport or Manchester airports. from $79 one way. \nIf you're driving to Logan, routes are well marked, but the airport road system is complex. Read the signs carefully and be sure you're in the correct lane. If an unexpected off-ramp sneaks up on you, don't panic, you can just drive around the airport loop again.\n\n\n==== Other airports ====\nA few small airports in New England add \"Boston\" to their name, even if they're in another state or have little means of reaching the city on public transportation. Flights to other New England airports such as Portland, Maine (PWM IATA) and Hartford (BDL IATA) occasionally appear in searches online, but are nearly 100 mi (160 km) from Boston! Not only are these airports impractical, they are usually more expensive due to economies of scale. Only use them if you're headed to the countryside in the first place.\n\nManchester-Boston Regional Airport (MHT IATA) (50 mi (80 km) north of Boston, accessible via Interstate 93). Main service is offered by Southwest Airlines, along with a few flights operated by American, Delta, and United. It is a great option if you plan on going to Northern New England or Boston's northern suburbs (Haverhill, Salem).\nT.F. Green Airport (PVD IATA) (60 mi (97 km) south of Boston, accessible via Interstate 95) - 15 domestic flights depart daily from T.F. Green. It's also a stop on MBTA's Providence/Stoughton commuter rail line, although only a handful of rush-hour trains stop at this station each day. Otherwise you'll need to take a bus or cab to the train station downtown to catch the commuter rail to Boston.\nWorcester-Boston Regional Airport (ORH IATA), 40 mi (64 km) west of Boston. Served by JetBlue, with daily service only to Orlando and Fort Lauderdale in Florida.\nIf you're coming from outside the US, it may be cheaper to fly into one of the New York City airports (JFK IATA or EWR IATA) and reach Boston via bus or rail (see below). Carefully consider the unlisted time and costs of this journey, however, as you'll have to organize everything yourself. Once you add up fares for AirTrain, subway, bus, and cabs; you'll quickly see your airfare savings evaporate. It can take over 8 hours to get from EWR to Boston for example, so consider a stopover in NYC if you're doing this.\n\n\n==== Private aviation ====\nBoston is a major global city among the 30 most economically powerful cities in the world. Its metropolitan area holds the 6th-largest economy in the United States, and the 12th-largest in the world, making it the main private aviation hub for New England.\nBoston Logan offers 3 private FBO terminals for private air travel, however, the main airport for private and general aviation in Boston is Laurence G. Hanscom Field (FAA LID: BED), about 20 mi (32 km) northwest in Bedford, MA. Norwood Memorial Airport (FAA LID: OWD) is just southwest of I-95 in Norwood, MA, while Beverly Regional Airport (FAA LID: BVY) and Lawrence Municipal Airport (FAA LID: LWM) offer arrivals to the north of Boston.\nAir charter companies such as Harvard Air Taxi offer shuttle flights within the Northeast, while brokers including Tailwind Aviation and Jet Charter Boston offer access to private planes based at airports across the country for private flights to/from Boston and surrounding areas of New England. Aircraft options can range from luxury planes including Gulfstreams to economical single and twin-engine planes for individuals and small groups.\n\n\n=== By train ===\nSee also: Rail travel in the United States\n\n Amtrak, \u260f +1 215-856-7924, toll-free: +1-800-872-7245. Boston is served by the national passenger rail service, as well as suburban commuter trains. The most important station is South Station, where all long-distance Amtrak routes and most commuter rail routes terminate. The other main station is North Station, which handles all northbound commuter rail traffic and the Amtrak route to Maine. It takes about 15-30 stressful minutes to transfer between the two stations.   (updated Oct 2023)\n1 North Station, 135 Causeway Street.   (updated Oct 2023)\n2 South Station, 700 Atlantic Ave.   (updated Mar 2025)\n\nAll heavy gauge Commuter Rail trains (called the T, or purple line) terminate in either North Station or South Station. Once in town, you will find a variety of stations where switching to the light rail (or T) is quick and easy. They run as far as Worcester, Lowell, and Providence, RI, and are significantly cheaper than Amtrak trains. The furthest you can get down the Cape, is Hyannis aboard the Cape Flyer. This service is provided only during summer and in cooperation with the MBTA and the Cape Cod Regional Transit Authority.\n\nAcela travels multiple times daily between Boston and Washington, D.C. with stops in Westwood, Providence, New Haven, Stamford, New York City, Newark, Philadelphia, Wilmington, and Baltimore. It is the fastest train in America (and slowest \"high speed\" train in the world). Trains travels to South Station with travel times of 2.25 hours from New Haven, 4 hours from New York City, 5.5 hours from Philadephia, and 7 hours from Washington, D.C. While the fare is expensive, trains are luxurious with great Wi-Fi and power outlets. You also won't have to go through airport security, or worry about traffic delays affecting your schedule.\nNortheast Regional a cheaper train running multiples times daily along the eastern seaboard. Similar to the Acela, but with local stops from South Station including: New Haven (3 hr), New York (5 hr), Philadelphia (7 hr), Washington D.C. (9 hr), Richmond, Virginia (12 hr). The overnight Northeast Regional service from Washington, D.C. includes sleeping cars, the train departs Washington, D.C around 9PM and arrives early morning in Washington, D.C.\nDowneaster operating five or six trains in each direction daily between Brunswick and Boston's North Station with stops Freeport, Portland, Old Orchard Beach (seasonal), Saco, Wells, Dover, Durham, Exeter, Haverhill, and Woburn. Travel time to Boston from Brunswick is 3 hours 20 minutes, and form Portland is 2 hours 30 minutes.\nLake Shore Limited operating daily between Chicago and Boston or New York City. It makes stops at most stations along the route, though it does not stop at some of the smallest stations. Trains consist of train cars from both branches between Chicago and Albany (Rensselaer). The trains split into separate branches between Albany (Rensselaer) and both Boston and New York City. Stops between Chicago and Albany (Rensselaer) include South Bend, Elkhart, Waterloo, Bryan, Toledo, Sandusky, Elyria, Cleveland, Erie, Buffalo (Depew), Rochester, Syracuse, Utica, and Schenectady. Stops between Albany (Rensselaer) and Boston include Pittsfield, Springfield, Worcester, Framingham. In Boston, the terminus is South Station. Travel time to Boston from Chicago is 19.5 hours, from Buffalo is 11 hours, from Albany (Rensselaer) is 5 hours.\nCape Flyer a summer weekend passenger train that runs from Memorial Day to Labor Day from South Station to Hyannis (2h20min), with stops in Braintree, Brockton, Middleborough/Lakeville, Wareham Village and Buzzards Bay.\n\n\n=== By bus ===\nSee also: Long-distance bus travel in the United States\n\nAlmost every bus departing or arriving to Boston does so at South Station. The bus terminal is just a few hundred feet south of the train terminal. If you're arriving by T, walk upstairs and outside. Then keep the trains on your left, and follow the signs to get to the bus station. You should arrive 30 minutes before your scheduled departure, especially if your carrier doesn't assign seats. If you need food, try to arrive a little earlier to buy it near the trains. The train station has a variety of food options, while only the most basic facilities will be available near the busses.\nMany bus fares can be fairly reasonable if you book at least a week or two in advance (since pricing is demand based), although routes served by Greyhound/ Peter Pan can range from pricey to outright extortion. Some companies offer teaser fares as low as $1, but you'd need to book almost a year in advance and get lucky to boot. The New York City route is very popular, taking about 5 hours on average. However, it could take less than 4 if you leave in the dead of night, or over 8 hours if you get unlucky with traffic. If you're going anywhere other than NYC, typically only a single bus company serves the route. If you're facing bus rides of 10 hours or more, it's probably worth looking into the cost of flying, plane tickets may be comparable or even cheaper than traveling by bus.\n\n BoltBus, South Station, toll-free: +1 877 265-8287. Another option connecting Boston with New York City, Newark, and Philadelphia. This was one of the first companies to offer passengers Wi-Fi and power outlets on board. Today you will find these amenities on almost every intercity bus. \n C & J, South Station and Logan Airport, \u260f +1 603-430-1100, toll-free: +1-800-258-7111. Connecting Boston to Newburyport, MA, Portsmouth, NH, and Dover, NH. \n Concord Coach Lines, South Station and Logan Airport, \u260f +1 603 228-3300, toll-free: +1-800-639-3317. Serving Maine with Portland, Augusta, Bangor, and many smaller communities along ocean and highway routes. Also serving New Hampshire with Manchester and Concord, before branching into two routes. Each branch serves little villages along the way to Littleton, NH and Berlin, NH. \n Flixbus, (bus stop) 90 Traveler Street (Pickup area is in an LAZ parking lot. Enter the lot on NE corner of Traveler and Albany St. Pickup area is in the first row of parking spaces as cars pull into the lot. The area will have a FlixBus \"wait here\" sign.). Only to/from New York. They also have another stop at 38 Professors Row in Tufts University. (updated Nov 2019)\n Go Bus, 11 Cambridgepark West, Cambridge (Alewife Station). It's not in Boston, but this company connects Cambridge (Alewife Station) and Newton (Riverside Station) with New York City. \n Greyhound Bus Lines, South Station, \u260f +1 617 526-1800. If you can find it on a map, Greyhound probably runs a bus there. Not always the best option, but sometimes the only one. For example, this is the only carrier connecting Boston with Montr\u00e9al. \n   LimoLiner, 39 Dalton Street, Sheraton Back Bay, \u260f +1 309 502-6411. A luxury bus transportation offering professionals business services between New York City and Boston. They may offer hot meals, waitstaff and wood paneling, but you'll have to sit in traffic like everyone else. $99 one way. \n Lucky Star Bus, South Station, \u260f +1 617 734-1268. Between Boston's South Station and New York's Chinatown. Buses are nice and run every 30 minutes. You can buy tickets 24-1 hours before departure only. $25 one way. \n Megabus, South Station, toll-free: +1-877-462-6342. Connecting Boston with the larger cities in the region. New York City, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, D.C. Also serving Secaucus, NJ, Portland, ME, Burlington, VT, New Haven and Hartford, CT. \n Peter Pan Bus Lines, South Station, toll-free: +1-800-343-9999. Kind of like Greyhound, but for New England. Serves almost every town in the region, as well as the big boys: New York, Philadelphia, and Washington D.C. \n Plymouth & Brockton (Street Railway Co), South Station and Logan Airport and 200 Stuart St., \u260f +1 508-746-0378. This bus company serves Cape Cod. Going from Boston to Rockland, Plymouth, Sagamore, Barnstable and Hyannis. The route then continues from Hyannis up the Cape, makng several stops on the way to Provincetown. (updated Jul 2015)\n\n\n=== By car ===\nSee also: Driving in the United States\n\nIf you\u2019re coming from anywhere that isn\u2019t on the east coast, I-90 is how you will enter the city. Officially called The Massachusetts Turnpike, locals call it \"The Mass Pike\", or simply \"The Pike\". Running east/west with a direct connection to Logan Airport, the road is over 3,000 miles long and can take you as far as Seattle, if you've got time. I-90 ends (or does it begin?) with the Ted Williams Tunnel. Built during the Big Dig, it burrows under Boston Harbor to connect East Boston and Logan Airport with the rest of the city. The Pike is a toll road without toll booths, so cash transactions are not allowed. The tolls are paid automatically by E-ZPass (car mounted transponders) that communicate with sensors installed along the road. If you're missing a transponder, don't worry. Overhead cameras will snap a picture of your license plate and mail you a bill. In general, tolls are inexpensive. Less than 2 bucks to get out of the city, and $1.50 for the Ted Williams Tunnel.\nI-93 and  Route 1 are the major north-south highways in Boston. I-93 is toll free, and like everything else in Boston it has several names no one quite seems to agree on. The Southeast/Northern Expressway, or simply the Expressway are most common, usually referring to the section of I-93 within the Boston metro area. Another name for the road is \"The Central Artery\", or \"The \"Tip\" O'Neill Tunnel\", referring to the bit which runs beneath the core of the city. This stretch was built during the Big Dig and connects I-93 with I-90, and US-1. Route 1, also known as the Northeast Expressway, connects Boston with its northeastern and southwestern suburbs. Heading north from Boston, Route 1 is a toll road, crossing over the Tobin Bridge north of the Zakim before leading to a strip of commercial development in Saugus and connecting to I-95. Heading southwest, Route 1 is a scenic parkway that parallels Boston\u2019s Emerald Necklace system of parks, before becoming a regional commercial artery in West Roxbury. Crossing the mouth of the Charles River, you will drive over The Zakim, or Bunker Hill Memorial Bridge. This visually striking bridge is at the intersection of Route 1 and I-93, and was designed to echo the Bunker Hill Monument next door.\nOf note, I-95 (known locally as Route 128) does not enter Boston directly. During the 1960s, there were plans to run I-95 along the commuter rail tracks from the Route 128 Amtrak station up to I-93, and then up to the Zakim and along what is now Route 1, but those plans were scrapped. It instead bypasses the city by ringing around its northern and western suburbs. \nIf coming from the Seacoast of New Hampshire, Maine, or Atlantic Canada, take I-95 down to Exit 44 then take US 1 South to I-93. I-95 is a toll road throughout New Hampshire and parts of Southern Maine, and Route 1 (as mentioned earlier) is a toll road continuation of I-95 into Boston. If coming from Providence, New York City, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C, and points south, take I-95 north to I-93 near Canton.\nIf coming from Hartford and most of Pennsylvania, take I-84 to merge onto I-90 near Sturbridge.\nIn downtown Boston, along Route 1A, you will find two more tunnels sunk beneath the harbor, The Callahan Tunnel and The Sumner Tunnel. These tunnels are smaller and poorly located (they connect at Haymarket), and you still need to pay a toll to use them. Only use them if you are in the area anyway, or there is a problem with the Ted Williams Tunnel.\nOther notable roads include Route 2, sweeping in from the northwestern suburbs, Route 9, which parallels the Pike and is toll free. It is an alternate route if you are coming into the city from Worcester or the MetroWest suburbs in Middlesex County, and Storrow Drive and Memorial Drive (two parkways paralleling the Charles River).\n\n\n=== By boat ===\nFor a city on the ocean, there are surprisingly few options to arrive by ship. For in-state voyages, head to Long Wharf, located downtown next to the aquarium. From here MBTA ferries depart to Provincetown, Lynn, and Salem seasonally; while Hingham and Hull are served year round. If you're looking to spend a little more time at sea, head to Black Falcon Cruise Terminal  (\u260f +1 617-330-1500). From here cruise ships depart to Ft. Lauderdale, Montr\u00e9al, and Quebec City. Some ships travel as far as Bermuda, the Netherlands, or even San Diego via the Panama Canal!\n\n\n== Get around ==\nUnlike other large American cities, Boston is not laid out on a grid. Folklore says modern streets were designed by wandering cows, which is surely a myth. What's more likely is that existing Native American trails were reused and extended over the years. New paths were cut around hills and streams, and shallow marshes were hastily filled in wherever the force of commerce demanded. Even the burning of the city in 1872 wasn't widespread enough to trigger a comprehensive urban update.\nWith a compact and walkable central core, Boston is more similar to a European city than to its American counterparts. The narrow, winding streets can sometimes make getting around a bit of a challenge, but with a good map and a sense of adventure anyone can find their way. Most streets are clearly labeled, especially in the more touristy areas. Don't be surprised by streets' frequent name changes and name reuse. Many Boston neighborhoods were independent cities 100 years ago, and as they were annexed, so were their naming conventions. It's why a road might have a different name at every stop light, and why Tremont St. intersects with a different Tremont St. Keep your eyes peeled for more of these quirks while you're in town.\n\n\n=== By public transit ===\n\nThe best way to get around Boston is the MBTA, or \"T\" for short. Bostonians complain about it endlessly, but its convenience, affordable cost and extensive coverage are undeniable. As the fourth largest transit system in the US, the T conducts a daily symphony of every conveyance imaginable to move over 1.3 million people to their destinations. Use your favorite mapping application, or the MBTA-endorsed transit app to help plan your route.\nMBTA buses, light rail, and subway trains accept contactless payment, but the commuter rail and boat ferries do not. Note that the MBTA does not do fare capping for contactless payment. Paper tickets can be purchased as well from kiosks at virtually every entrance to every station systemwide; and all accept cash, credit and debit cards. You can also pick up a reusable CharlieCard and add value to it.\nTrain rides cost a flat $2.40, whether you're traversing the city or just going one stop. Rather than paying per ride, you could instead buy something called a \"LinkPass\". With this option you'll get unlimited rides for $11/day or $22.50 for 7 days. It's not a crazy deal, but could save you some money if you're riding the train a lot. Changing between subway or light rail is free wherever they connect. You can also transfer from subway to bus (or vice versa) for free, for up to 2 transfers within 2 hours of your first tap in when using a CharlieCard or contactless. Some stations do not offer free transfers to the other direction, so keep that in mind if you go the wrong way. Once you have exited the turnstiles, boarding a bus is a free transfer, but you'll have to pay again if you decide to get back on the train or change to a third bus.\nCouldn't get a CharlieCard? Really? Most stations have them available in fare vending machines. All the big stations downtown have them. They're also carried by many convenience stores and maybe your hotel. Did you try the CharlieCard store by the Roche Bros entrance of Downtown Crossing Station? Well, if you're not using contactless payment, it looks like you'll be stuck with a CharlieTicket. The CharlieTicket is printed on paper, and is tappable just like a CharlieCard. It's fine if you're only riding the train once or twice.\nThe CharlieCards/Tickets are valid for all travel on the subway, trolley, and local busses. If you're traveling on the commuter rail or boats you'll have to switch to mTicket to pay your fare. You could buy paper tickets the old fashioned way, from a ticket window at North Station, Back Bay, or South Station. Finally, you can always just use cash and buy your tickets onboard from the conductor, although you'll pay a $3 surcharge for doing that. \nUnlike the flat fare for the subway, bus, and light rail, the commuter rail uses a zone-based system, from Zone 1A to Zone 8. If you are riding on the weekend, there is a $10 unlimited ride weekend pass that you can purchase through the mTicket app, which is often far more economical than standard tickets for weekend-only trips. \n\n\n==== Subway ====\nThe Red, Orange, and Blue lines comprise Boston's traditional subway service. One thing Boston does a little differently, is that any transit running into the center is labeled as \"inbound\" and everything running away as \"outbound\". There are always signs for the last stop in your direction, in case you find that method more familiar. Train service starts around 5:30AM (6:15 AM Sundays) and ends around 12:30AM, so make your travel plans accordingly. You can bring your bike on any subway, just not during rush hours.\nThe Red line is the busiest and one of the most helpful for visitors to Boston. The (as of 2024) slowest subway line in the system, trains north of JFK/UMass station arrive every 7-12 minutes. South of JFK/UMass, trains run every 21-23 minutes as the Red line splits into two branches. One terminates in Ashmont Station in Dorchester, while the other heads way out of the city and into Braintree. The trains used on this line are pretty old, but are slowly being replaced by shiny new trains throughout the 2020s.\nThe Orange line runs every 8-15 minutes. The replacement of its cars on this line was completed in 2023. It connects downtown with Roslindale and Malden, and is a great way to access the Arboretum and Franklin Park. \nThe much more modern Blue line runs every 5-6 minutes during peak times, and every 9-14 minutes during off-peak times. It runs from downtown to Wonderland on the North Shore. Outside of the airport connection and Revere Beach, it's not of much use to tourists, although you can find some great getaways along this route.\n\n\n==== Trolley ====\n\nMost people would consider the Green line a trolley, though it does use a subway tunnel in the city center. When running above ground, the Green line serves many neighborhoods by splitting into four branches: B, C, D, and E. Each branch runs trolleys about every 9-15 minutes or so, it can depend on traffic. The B, C, and D lines converge at Kenmore Station. The E branch is a little wacky, running on the street through Mission Hill and Longwood before joining up with the pack at Copley Station. All trolleys will go to Park Street, but only some continue on to Union Square in Somerville. You'll just have to get off and wait for the next one.\nServing Allston/Brighton, the ironically named B line is the slowest of the bunch. If you're going less than four stops on the B, it's probably faster to walk. The C line follows Beacon Street through Brookline. The C has to wait for stoplights like the B, but it's faster due to a direct route and fewer stops. The D line cuts a more southerly path through Brookline, ending up in Newton. With its own dedicated right of way, the D line is a (comparative) rocket ship.\nOff the radar of most Bostonians, the Mattapan High Speed Line is an extension of the Red line. Departing every 12-15 minutes from Ashmont, it connects Dorchester with Mattapan via Milton. These cute little cars are from the late 1940s, and could almost be considered a tourist attraction in themselves for train aficionados.\n\n\n==== Bus ====\nWhile the MBTA classifies the Silver line as rapid transit, it is clearly a bus. Riders pay subway fares to board SL1, SL2, and SL3 branches, while bus fares are charged to board SL4 and SL5 branches. If you have a CharlieCard or contactless card, just tap and go to remove all doubt.\nThe SL4 and SL5 run from Downtown through South End to Dudley. The SL2 runs through South Boston, connecting with the SL1 at South Station. The SL1 connects from South Station to Logan Airport, running through its many terminals. The SL3 is a new branch of the Silver Line, running on its own dedicated run of way from Chelsea, with a quick stop at Airport, before continuing to South Station.\nRegular bus service is cheaper than the train and usually takes you closer to your final destination, but can take longer and typically run less frequently, unless it's a Key Bus Route. Express buses are more expensive and travel over longer distances, typically between downtown Boston and Route 128 suburbs during rush hour commutes. CharlieCard and contactless users will enjoy free transfers from the subway and pay $1.70 for regular bus, $4.00 for Inner Express, and $5.25 for Outer Express buses. (You will almost certainly be on a regular bus.) \n\n\n==== Commuter rail ====\nCommuter rail in Boston is primarily used by office workers traveling back and forth to their homes in the suburbs. Twelve rail lines fan out in all directions, and service is most frequent during rush hours. Fares range from $2.40 to $13.25 one way. You can purchase tickets once onboard, but you'll pay an extra $3 for the convenience if there were fare machines at your departure station. The official way to buy tickets is with the mTicket app - it's free to download and you don't need an account. The $10 weekend pass is exclusive to the mTicket app. If you prefer to do things the old fashioned way, wait in line to buy tickets at North Station, South Station, or Back Bay Station. One rarely helpful fact, you can ride commuter rail trains for free from Back Bay to South Station only.\nTrains heading north of the city leave from North Station, while those heading south or west leave from South Station. Both stations have good connections to the subway. North Station is on the Green and Orange lines, and South Station is on the Red and Silver lines.  The two stations are not directly connected, and it can take 15-30 minutes to connect between the two depending how you do it. North Station trains reach tourist favorites like Salem, Gloucester, and Concord. South Station trains connect to Providence, Plymouth, Framingham, Worcester, and occasionally Gillette Stadium in Foxboro. Make sure you have your return train picked out! Trains become more and more infrequent as the night wears on (2 - 3 hour frequencies between trains are common on most lines evenings and weekends). The last trains to get back into the city leave around 9:00PM-10:00PM, and the last trains departing out from the city around 10:45PM-11:45PM; accommodations can be scarce in the suburban communities. Some lines don't run on weekends.\n\n\n==== Ferry ====\n\nThe MBTA runs a number of water shuttles year round. The most useful for tourists is the Inner Harbor Ferry (F4) from Long Wharf to Navy Yard for $3.50. This provides a convenient connection between the USS Constitution and the New England Aquarium. There's also a shuttle from Long Wharf to Logan Airport, the F2H, but it runs relatively infrequently. Plan ahead if you want to make good use of it. Commuter ferries also visit Hull and Hingham to the tune of $9.25 a pop. It's a bit further so you pay more.\nThere are also non-MBTA public ferries available from several docks, notably the Aquarium and Rowes Wharf, as well as a water taxi service. These make scores of stops all along Boston's waterfront. You can just wait for it to show up in the summer, or call 15 minutes ahead if you're on a rigid schedule. It's $12 per ticket, and kids are free. The same company that runs the water taxis also runs harbor island ferries out to Georges Island; several other smaller islands are accessible from there.\n\n\n==== The RIDE ====\n The RIDE, \u260f +1 617 337-2727. A paratransit service for those who cannot use the regular transit system due to their disabilities. You will have to book way, way in advance. Call ideally a week or more before your trip. Make sure you have \"certification of ADA paratransit eligibility\", or plenty of time to burn on the phone going over your particulars with service staff. Everyone is frustrated with these dilapidated vans, but at least they exist. \n\n\n=== By foot ===\nWear a comfortable pair of shoes, because you're going to be doing a lot of walking while you're here. There's really no other way to properly investigate the tucked away side streets and historical plaques. Downtown and the Back Bay in particular are compact and easily walkable. To give you an idea, walking the two miles between the State House and Fenway Park should only take about 45 minutes.\nWhile here, it's almost impossible not to notice the sheer amount of jaywalking Bostonians do on a daily basis. For historical reasons there may not be a well placed crosswalk, while the streets are narrow and traffic crawls.  When you need to cross the road, do what the locals do and just walk out into the street! Use common sense of course, don't walk out from behind a truck or try to cross a multi-lane highway.\n\n\n=== By car ===\n\nDriving in Boston is strongly discouraged in the dense, tourist-friendly areas of the city. Boston drivers are notoriously aggressive and impulsive, and construction is a way of life. The jaywalkers alone will give you a heart attack. But if you insist, here are a few helpful tips. Local drivers frequently run yellow (even red!) lights, so be careful accelerating when your light changes to green. Be prepared to change lanes at any time. Some travel lanes become right turn only lanes, or parking lanes, or simply cease to exist. Drivers double park wherever they please, so prepare to stop at any time. Do not try to squeeze past a bus or cut off a trolley: they are much bigger than you, and you will lose. If you encounter a rotary you should yield; remember the right of way belongs to traffic in the rotary. Don't stop in a rotary! Some streets are two ways, but are only wide enough for one car. Don't panic, just pull into the parking lane while the other guy passes by.\nGarage parking is expensive, around $12-15/hour and $40-50/day, assuming spaces are available. Garages are found near Quincy Market, the Aquarium, State Street Financial Center, the Theater District and Boston Common. Remember to factor in the 30 minutes or so it will take to get the half a mile from the highway to one of these garages. On-street parking is usually resident only, which requires a special sticker. Time limits on parking meters are zealously enforced for the precious few spaces that remain. The city is rolling out high tech solutions and even experimenting with \"surge pricing\" in some neighborhoods. Many meters are digital kiosks that print a receipt for you to display on your windshield, while a few remain the old school quarter gobblers. As a rule, if you think you are parked illegally, you probably are. Parking fines range from $25-120 depending on the infraction.\nIf you're heading into Boston for a day trip, consider dropping your car at a lot and taking the \"T\" in. Parking at MBTA locations is cheaper than parking in the city, and you don't have to deal with driving there. These stations do have large parking lots, but on weekdays they'll fill up by 9:30AM.\n\nAlewife ($7/day, $8 overnight), adjacent to Route 2\nBraintree ($7/day, $8 overnight), near I-93\nRiverside($6/day, $7 overnight), near I-90/Route 128\nQuincy Adams ($7/day, $8 overnight), adjacent to I-93\nWellington ($6/day, $7 overnight), near I-93, adjacent to Route 16\n\n\n=== By taxi and ride-share ===\nAlthough there is no one official livery, taxis in Boston are predominantly white in color (hence called \"white cabs\" by locals). Including a tip for the driver and any highway tolls you might need to pay, expect to spend at least $15 and possibly up to $40 for an in town ride. Cabs are more expensive in Boston than you might expect, so be judicious using cabs if money is a concern. For example an $80 taxi fare from the airport to the nearby suburb of Wellesley, would not be unreasonable. Uber X and Lyft are both available and may be cheaper than taking a white cab, especially for longer trips. Be careful during major events, as \"surge pricing\" could actually make these options more expensive than a traditional taxi.\n\n\n=== By bicycle ===\n\nMany Boston residents use bicycling as their primary mode of transit all year round. Boston's small size and relative flatness make biking an effective and appealing way to get around. Efforts under the Menino administration increased city investment in bicycling and the bad old days of \"worst cycling city in America\" are long gone. Cambridge does tend to have more bicycle lanes and racks than Boston, although Boston is catching up.\nMost bicycle traffic is going to and from Cambridge, so you'll often see the Longfellow and Mass Ave bridges festooned with spandex. Comm Ave is a busy east/west corridor, as students and commuters make their way across Allston and into downtown. Another popular route is the Southwest Corridor Bike Path, running parallel to the Orange line. It connects JP and Roxbury to the Back Bay. This is an excellent means of transit if you intend on visiting some of the city's southern parks.\nBoston and its neighboring cities run a bike-sharing service, Bluebikes. Similar to many other urban bike-sharing services, riders pick up a bicycle at any station and return it to any station. The system is optimized for commuting and short trips. Your pass grants unlimited 30 minute rides, but fees are charged for long rides in order to keep bike stations full. If you're going to be doing some distance riding, consider renting your own bike for a day or two.\n\n Bluebikes (formerly Hubway). 24 hours daily. Bike sharing service offering 3,000 bikes across 300 stations in Boston and 4 nearby municipalities. Journeys longer than 30 minutes (2 hours for the Adventour pass) cost an additional $2.50/30 minutes. Don't forget to bring your helmet; none are offered at the stations! $10/one day, $20/month. \n Cambridge Bicycle, 259 Massachusetts Ave (T: Central), \u260f +1 617-876-6555. Renting out Linus Dutchi and Roadster Sport 3-speeds. Set up with flat resistant tubes and tires plus a cute little basket to store whatever you've got. $35/day. \n Urban AdvenTours, 103 Atlantic Ave (T: Aquarium), \u260f +1 617-670-0637. Provides all types of bike rentals: mountain, road, hybrid, even \"e-bikes\" with pedal assist. Rentals include helmet and lock. Delivery available. $40-100/day. \n\n\n== See ==\nIndividual listings can be found in Boston's district articles\nFor some of the best discounts on popular tourist attractions check out 50 Under 50. Run by the official Massachusetts Tourism organization, they offer deals on a few of the most popular options in town. Also look into the Boston CityPASS, which for $56 allows you 9 days to visit up to four famous sights. Alternatively, the GoBoston Card allows more flexibility by offering passes purchased by number of days or attractions visited. Ranging in price anywhere from $39-175, this could be a deal if you're really going to be doing a lot of sightseeing.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nMany notable buildings in town can be found within the Back Bay and Beacon Hill neighborhoods. The facade and gold dome of the Massachusetts State House are well proportioned; while both the modern and classical halves of the Boston Public Library are distinguished in their own right. The many churches nearby are also extraordinarily picturesque. Trinity Church spawned a style of architecture all its own, the Old South Church graces many a postcard, and the grounds of the Christian Science Center make for a pleasant stroll year-round. Finally no tourist visit is complete without a stop at venerable Quincy Market.\nPossibly the best example of modern architecture in the city is Boston City Hall. While this brutalist structure is mainly notable for how disliked it is, don't give up on evocative modernism just yet. Head over to Cambridge and explore the campuses of Harvard and (especially) MIT. There, you'll see some fantastic \"starchitecture\" by the likes of Le Corbusier, Eero Saarinen, and Frank Gehry to name but a few. If you're into it, poke around online to find out when universities have the next tour scheduled.\n\n\n=== Colonial ===\nA main feature on many itineraries will be touring colonial era Boston. One of the oldest public buildings in the country, the Old State House is striking and draped in historical significance. Faneuil Hall is conveniently located and always a favorite, while the Old South Meeting House was a hotbed of patriot activity in its day. Closer to the waterfront, Boston's North End is no slouch either when it comes to historical sites. Visit the Old North Church, where Paul Revere began his famous ride. Then follow that up with a stop at his nearby home, the Paul Revere House.\nThe Longfellow House is a National Historic Site in Cambridge. It's where Washington had his headquarters in 1776, and what's a good tour of colonial America without George Washington, right?  Additional interesting 18th-century sites can by found way off the beaten path in Roxbury. If you make it out this way, don't miss the Shirley-Eustis House, one of the last remaining royal governors mansions. Once the town center, Roxbury Heritage State Park holds the Dillaway-Thomas House as well as the First Church of Roxbury. All are fantastic examples of 18th century life in Boston.\nMany of Boston's suburbs have their own colonial-era historic sites. Of particular note, the town of Lexington is a must for any history buff coming into Boston. It's 20-30 minutes northwest of the city by car, depending on traffic (follow signs for Route 2, or if you have a bike, take the Red Line to the Minuteman Commuter Bikeway). The town is famous for being a stop on Paul Revere's Midnight Ride, which originated in Boston, and many colonial monuments and historic buildings can be found throughout the town. \n\n\n=== Landmarks ===\nIf you're near the water, you can't help but notice Fort Independence on South Boston's shoreline. If you're a sucker for civil war forts, also check out Fort Warren on George's Island. Ostensibly commissioned to provide for the defense of the city, in reality these forts were outdated by the time they were built. Also on the harbor, Charlestown has the Bunker Hill Monument which can be seen for miles around. Don't forget the iconic U.S.S. Constitution, oldest commissioned naval vessel in the world. Save your American Theseus conjectures for the classroom, professor!\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nBoston has some fantastic museums covering a wide variety of topics and interests. The Museum of Fine Arts in the Fenway is the city's premiere, offering a great range of artifacts in a more traditional museum format. Highlights include works by popular French impressionists, ancient Egyptian artifacts, and a comprehensive collection of early American art. The nearby Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, by contrast, is an imaginative and eclectic space, an Italian palazzo in America featuring art curated by Isabella's discerning eye.\nFor modern art instead, visit the Institute of Contemporary Art in South Boston. The exhibitions here have featured artists like Anish Kapoor, Tara Donovan and Shepard Fairey. They also feature lesser known artists working with glass, textiles, or sound. If you doubt that will hold the attention of your children, take them to the Boston Children's Museum. Very interactive and engaging, look for the oversize milk bottle out front. If the \"kids\" are a little older, try the Museum of Science in the West End. They have an enormous Van de Graaff generator (the world's largest!), and some exhibits were designed by Charles and Ray Eames.\nRight in the thick of it all downtown, you'll find the New England Aquarium. Walk around the giant cylinder simulating a coral reef, or just chill and watch the penguins doing their thing. While small, the Museum of African American History in Beacon Hill tells a big story about an often overlooked narrative in Boston's history. Finally, if you're into modern history, do not miss the JFK Presidential Library and Museum in Dorchester.\nIn Cambridge, Harvard University holds very impressive collections at the Harvard Museum of Natural History and the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology. The \"glass flowers\" exhibit alone has been on tourists to-do lists for over a hundred years. For strictly visual arts, explore The Fogg and The Sackler, among other museums scattered around campus. Don't forget the engaging MIT Museum! It's got a variety of great interactive exhibits and is well worth your time.\n\n\n=== Parks ===\n\nLike many other major American cities, Boston has a series of parks designed by none other than Frederick Law Olmsted. Called The Emerald Necklace, these parks comprise almost half the green space in town. The oldest and most loved of these parks is Boston Common. In the center of it all, this park is always in use. Right next door you'll find the Public Garden. Although smaller, its many plantings and formal design give this park a more genteel feeling. Coming right up to the waters edge, the gorgeous Charles River Esplanade makes relaxing easy and provides a fantastic escape from city life.\nIf you're downtown, it's almost impossible to miss the Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Greenway. This wonderful green ribbon replaced a noxious and congested expressway with art, food, and life. Its construction restored connections to neighborhoods that for decades were cut off from the rest of the city.\nFurther afield, the Arnold Arboretum in Jamaica Plain is officially all about the science. Although that would come as news to the crowds soaking in the grandeur of this immaculately landscaped park. No picnics please, this is serious fun. Keep exploring in Roxbury and pay a visit to Franklin Park, the biggest link in Olmsted's Emerald Necklace. Despite needing some maintenance, Franklin Park has miles of great hiking and biking trails. Not to mention a zoo and an 18-hole municipal golf course. White Stadium, located in the park, is used mainly for high school sports, but is being renovated to serve as the home of Boston's future team in the National Women's Soccer League.\nThere are also a great many parks in East Boston. Being across the harbor, these parks and beaches are much less visited than the others in town. If you go, take the opportunity to mingle with locals as you watch the jets coming in for a landing at Logan airport.\n\n\n=== Itineraries ===\nThe Freedom Trail \u2014 A major tourist draw of significant historical sites in Boston. These 17 locations spread over 2.5 mi (4.0 km) are crucial to understanding revolutionary era America.\nBlack Heritage Trail \u2014 This less touristed trail covers ten sites important in American black history scattered throughout Beacon Hill.\n\n\n== Do ==\nIndividual listings can be found in Boston's district articles\nFor up to date listings have a look at The Boston Calendar, a filterable list of almost everything going on in town. Also check out the city of Boston's event page. It's a mix of things that appeal to residents as well as visitors. Another good resource for event listings of all shapes and sizes can be found in the free DigBoston publication. Grab a copy (or a competitor) from any newspaper box often found at busy intersections.\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nIf you're a lover of music, you'll find yourself right at home in Boston. With an array of venues, there is bound to be someone playing in town that will suit your tastes. The large student population helps to draw a wide variety of acts year round. For mega stars and headline performers, check out TD Garden or Fenway Park. Yeah these are normally sports arenas; but they'll also hold musical events for the right artists (think Janet Jackson, Bon Jovi or Lady Gaga). Another enormous musical attraction is Boston Calling, a multi-day festival put on at the end of May. Crowd into Harvard Stadium with 20,000 friends to see whichever established and up and coming artists the kids are into these days.\nWhen it comes to smaller venues, Allston-Brighton is the place to be. There's a variety of options, but if you're looking for the next indie sensation or band that's just starting to blow up, try either the Paradise Rock Club, Brighton Music Hall or Great Scott. Each place commonly selects good artists, but tickets can sell out almost instantly when bigger names come to play.\nThere are many more great music spots across the Charles in Cambridge. Check out the Middle East (upstairs or down) for a variety of national acts. The Phoenix Landing is a soccer forward restaurant, until nighttime when it transforms itself into a dance club. For a full on nightclub experience try the nearby Middlesex Lounge or head to The Plough & Stars instead for a solid bar with live rock acts. For a week in May, Together Boston  is an electronic festival where performances incorporate elements of art and technology.\nHead downtown to find the best nightclubs the city has to offer. Many of them are packed around Faneuil Hall (like the Hong Kong) or found down Boylston Place, a tiny gated alley off Boylston Street. Hosting music less often than you might think, the House of Blues on  Lansdowne Street usually books very talented acts whose popularity isn't as \"red hot\" as it once was.\nFor tiny venues that offer unique experiences, your best bet will be Wally's Cafe in the South End. This Jazz club was once one of dozens in the area, and is the last one remaining today. Still family owned and operated, you're likely to see gifted and passionate Berklee students gracing the stage. Shamble down the road to the Berklee Performance Center, another great spot for the adventurous traveller to hear accomplished yet unknown musicians.\nIntrepid explorers of melody could also check out the Midway Caf\u00e9 in Jamaica Plain. You never know what you're going to find, but there is often a Queer or Punk edge to the sound here. During the summertime, head into the neighborhoods and wander around a Porchfest or two. Homeowners allow their porches to become impromptu performance spaces for local and offbeat bands. Neighbors and visitors alike wander through city streets stopping at whatever piques their interest. The original in Somerville featuring hundreds of performers is the best, but JP has a good one too and Roslindale is also a contender.\n\n\n=== Performing arts ===\n\nHead to the Theater District to find unusual cultural and entertainment programs to attend all year-round. The center of Boston's theatre scene can be found among the dozens of 19th-century buildings scattered between Washington and Tremont streets. Even if the theatre isn't for you, just taking a stroll around this historic district can be a performance in itself. If you are buying tickets; however, look into performances happening at the Emerson owned Cutler Majestic Theatre or Paramount Theatre. Many great performers have graced the stage of the Wang Theatre over the years, another historic building with landmark status.\nUsing ornate Symphony Hall as their base, the world-renowned Boston Symphony Orchestra performs notable classical music during the fall, winter and spring. During summertime, they morph into the Boston Pops Orchestra to perform programs of light classical and popular music, consistently pleasing audiences. The first professional ballet company in New England, the Boston Ballet performs exclusively at the Boston Opera House. Their performance of The Nutcracker is particularly popular, running annually since the late 1960s.\nThe New England Conservatory is a world-famous music school right around the corner from Symphony Hall. It's well-known among musicians, but often overlooked by everyone else. The performances, recitals, and chamber group concerts found here are usually free and unticketed. Don't miss the Berklee Performance Center, yet another great spot in town to see talented performers (usually) on the cheap.\nAt the end of July a number of family friendly performers come to Copley Square to put on the Boston Summer Arts Weekend. It's supported by WGBH\u2014the local Public Broadcasting Station\u2014and the Boston Globe. Outside The Box  is another huge performing arts festival taking place on the Common in mid-July. It's pretty corporate, but there are still a few fun, free things to do for the whole family.\n\n\n=== Social dance ===\nThe Boston area has a very active social dance scene (see havetodance.com), although much of it is centered in Cambridge or in the suburbs. Travelers without prior experience may find the contra dances, such as the BIDA series on 1st and 3rd Sundays, particularly welcoming due to its ease of learning.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nBoston is a sports town, and its teams are as dearly loved by New Englanders as much as they are loathed by the rest of the country. Winning (or at least competing) in almost every championship game since 2002 will have that effect on people. Seeing almost any game here could be a trip highlight, you'll be crammed in with thousands of the most passionate sports fans in the country. Tickets will be hard to come by, however, so do your research and plan ahead.\nOne of the most prolific victors (and most likely to irritate football fans outside New England) are the New England Patriots. They play during wintertime at Gillette Stadium, southwest of the city in Foxborough. For a surefire argument starter, simply mention anything (positive or negative) about ex-quarterback Tom Brady or the \"deflategate\" scandal to any jersey-wearing native. Bringing up brothers Eli and Peyton Manning, the New York Giants, and Nick Foles-era Philadelphia Eagles will elicit a similar reaction. Eli's Giants have denied the Pats two rings in hotly-contested Super Bowls, whereas Foles' Eagles managed to stage one of the biggest upsets in sport history by beating the heavily favored Patriots in Super Bowl LII. Meanwhile, Peyton holds \"best quarterback\" status in the eyes of many football fans. Make sure you have a full drink before you broach these subjects, as you're going to get an earful. Also calling Gillette Stadium home is the New England Revolution, the region's soccer team. While not as popular as football, soccer fans are always very passionate as well. Both teams are owned by Robert Kraft, another lightning rod for passionate debate due to his controversial politics and personality.\nIn women's sports, the city will get a team in the National Women's Soccer League, the most established of the US' two top-level leagues in that sport, in 2026. BOS Nation FC will play at White Stadium in Franklin Park. The region also has a team in the Professional Women's Hockey League, the top level of women's hockey in North America. While the team is known as the Boston Fleet, it plays its home games in Lowell.\nTwo of Boston's oldest teams play at TD Garden, called \"Boston Garden\" or just \"The Garden\" by everyone who doesn't own a bank. As one of the original NBA teams, the Boston Celtics (pronounced SEL-tiks) have been shooting hoops since 1946. They've got a great rivalry going with the L.A. Lakers, which hit its zenith during the 1980s when Larry Bird and Magic Johnson would duke it out on the parquet. Also during the winter months, the Boston Bruins are in the West End and call the Garden home. The Bruins have been playing hockey since 1924, and are the oldest NHL team in the US. They, too, have a great rivalry, this time with the Montreal Canadiens to the north. The \"Habs\", as they're affectionately known, have shut down the Bruins during the Stanley Cup playoffs several times over the decades, something which Boston fans just can't forgive.\nLast but certainly not least, the Boston Red Sox are perhaps the team most closely linked with Boston's identity. The iconic Red Sox \"B\" logo can be seen gracing ball caps everywhere you look. For 86 years the Sox would start each season strong, only to see hopes of victory dashed by one unfortunate event or another. A bad play, a blown call, and the \"there's always next year\" mentality would kick back in. That all changed in 2004 when the drought was broken and the city rejoiced. The Red Sox have called Fenway Park home for over a hundred years, and \"the Cathedral of Baseball\" is well worth a visit even for the baseball averse. Jump at the opportunity if you can score tickets. It can be all but impossible to get into the park during a Red Sox-Yankees game. This is one of the fiercest rivalries in sport, strongly consider leaving your NY paraphernalia at home on game day.\nCollege athletics isn't a thing in Boston the way it can be in other regions of the country, but there are still some good Division I games to be found. Specifically, fans of college hockey shouldn't miss the Beanpot. This tournament is held during the first two Mondays of February and features teams from the four schools listed below.\n\nBoston College Eagles: The teams representing Boston College compete mainly in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), one of the so-called \"Power Four\" conferences in college sports. The ice hockey teams for men and women compete in Hockey East. The football team plays in the 45,000-seat Alumni Stadium in Chestnut Hill. The basketball and hockey teams play in the adjacent Conte Forum, known for hockey games as Kelley Rink.\nBoston University Terriers: Play mainly in the Patriot League, with both hockey teams playing in Hockey East, and hasn't had a football team for more than 20 years. The venues for the highest-profile sports are on campus in Allston. The men's hockey team plays at Agganis Arena; the women's hockey team at Walter Brown Arena; the basketball teams mainly at Case Gym (although the men's team will sometimes use one of the other two arenas); and teams in several outdoor sports play at Nickerson Field. The last of these venues is on the former site of Braves Field, where the Boston Braves played baseball before they moved to Milwaukee and later Atlanta. The original entry gate and right field stands remain in use, and the former ticket office now houses a BU campus police station. The left field stand is now the site of BU's West Campus freshman dorms.\nHarvard Crimson: The Crimson have played football at Harvard Stadium (in Allston as well) since 1903. This stadium and the nearby Jordan Field served as homes to the Boston Breakers, a women's professional soccer team, before the team folded after its 2017 season. Unlike the other schools listed here, the Crimson hockey teams play in ECAC Hockey instead of Hockey East, with home games at Bright\u2013Landry Hockey Center.\nNortheastern Huskies: Northeastern, like BU, doesn't have a football team; it plays mostly in the Coastal Athletic Association, with the hockey teams in Hockey East. The Northeastern hockey teams play in Matthews Arena, which is the oldest standing hockey arena in the world. Built in 1910 as Boston Arena, Matthews Arena was the original home of the Celtics and Bruins.\nTours in Boston are big business. Name any conveyance, and you're likely to find a tour built around it. The widest selection of tours depart from downtown, near the Aquarium. The fact that Duck Tours navigate the city by land and sea probably put them on top, but their competitors are no slouches either. A variety of companies offer harbor cruises, a pleasant and relaxing way to see the city. If you opt for a whale watch, go with the one affiliated with the Aquarium.\nYou can always visit choice historical sights by bicycle, foot, skateboard or Segway; although it's much more fun when the weather is nice. Don't forget some of the more popular tour companies also offer departures from the Back Bay.\n\n\n=== Events ===\n\n First Night: 31 December \u2013 1 January annually.  Boston's New Year's Eve celebration is the oldest public New Year's Eve party in America, and has been copied by cities around the world. It's a city-wide, family-friendly arts and culture festival which starts in the late morning with child-centric events and continues with dozens of music, dance, poetry and other exhibitions through midnight, culminating in fireworks on the waterfront. Dress appropriately!\n Evacuation Day (St. Patrick's Day): 17 March annually.  What the rest of America calls St. Patrick's Day, Boston calls Evacuation Day; a local holiday marking the expulsion of occupying British forces from the city. Remember to wear green, drink a beer, and wear something that says \"Kiss Me I'm Irish!\". Join the celebration at the huge parade held in Southie the closest Sunday.\n Patriot's Day (The Boston Marathon): .  The third Monday in April, or \"Marathon Monday\" as locals call it, is the oldest marathon in the world. The race started in 1897 and is run on the holiday commemorating Paul Revere's famous ride in 1775. Running from Hopkinton 26.2 miles to the finish line in Copley Square, the race draws crowds of over half a million spectators. Huge parts of the city are closed for the race, so don't plan on moving around too much. The Red Sox also play a home game on Patriot's Day; ensuring every bar, pub, and watering hole is filled to capacity by noon. (date needs fixing)\n Boston Pride Parade: .  The second largest event in the city after the Fourth of July. Boston's LBGT community\u2014and everyone else\u2014comes out for a fabulous parade from Copley Square, through the South End, to Boston Common. Many other social events are scheduled around this weekend. The Boston Pride organization dissolved itself in 2021, so the event's future is uncertain. (date needs fixing)\n Harborfest: .  A family-friendly oceanfront festival during the runup to Independence Day (July 4). Check out presentations on musket technology, 18th-century chocolate making, or even argue the Stamp Act! OK, but there are pub crawls too and it's cooler than it sounds. Several specialized historical, architectural, wildlife and sightseeing tours also available by land and sea. (date needs fixing)\n Independence Day: 4 July annually.  A host of events occur throughout the day culminating in fireworks and a Boston Pops concert on the Esplanade. Many roads close and trains are packed to bursting, as close to a million spectators try to squeeze along the banks of the Charles River. For a \"Boston\" take on this national holiday, head over to the Old State House during the day. Here you can listen as the Declaration of Independence is read in its entirety from the main balcony, just as it has been every year since 1776.\n St. Anthony's Feast: .  A religious festival taking place in the Italian North End neighborhood on  the last Sunday of August. Patron Saint of the poor, St Anthony is also known as the \"Saint of Miracles\" and the finder of lost articles. This feast includes plenty of food, games, music, and of course a parade down Hanover Street. (date needs fixing)\n Allston Christmas: 31 August \u2013 1 September annually.  This very unofficial holiday commemorates the annual \"changing of the leases\", as students across the city switch apartments. Picture tens of thousands of young people simultaneously renting moving trucks, and carting everything they own a half mile down the road. Whatever didn't fit in the truck goes on the street. Check out the curbs in densely populated student neighborhoods to find everything from furniture and kitchenware, to clothing or even food! The city's DPW works all day and night to keep up with the chaos.\n Head of the Charles Regatta: .  Mid-October. Thousands of rowers come together from around the globe for two days of competition in one of the world's largest regattas. Get there before 8AM to see the first sculls run. The course is on the Charles River between Cambridge and Allston, it can take about an hour to walk the three-mile course. Take the T to Harvard, Central, or any Boston University stop. (date needs fixing)\n\n\n== Learn ==\n\nThinking of going to school in Boston? Join the club. Boston has an estimated 250,000 college students, and dozens of colleges call the Greater Boston area home. Learning is ingrained in Boston's culture, and overhearing conversations about the Planck constant or Context theory while grabbing your morning coffee is not uncommon.\nUndoubtedly the most prestigious is Harvard University in Cambridge, where eight US presidents were educated. Two miles away, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is another one of the world's most prestigious universities. Not only do these two schools hold billions of dollars in endowments; they also churn out Nobel laureates, Rhodes Scholars, new companies, and patents by the wagonload. These are some of the most selective schools on earth, so if you're applying here, good luck!\nThere are of course other top tier research universities in Boston:\n\nBoston University is 65,000 strong and sprawls across a one and a half mile long urban campus throughout Fenway and Allston. BU was attended by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who earned his PhD here in 1955. BU is known for its unique housing system - a mix between smaller brownstones, larger traditional-style buildings, and the Student Village suites and apartments.\nNot to be confused with Boston University,  Boston College is a highly-regarded private Jesuit Catholic research university. Unlike BU, Boston College has a more traditional college campus feel. Despite its name, Boston College is actually in Chestnut Hill, and is also a fully accredited university. Boston College is perhaps known for its unrivaled on-campus scenery.\nNortheastern University is another highly respected private research university, with a student population of around 40,000. Admissions is selective, but this is mainly because of the sheer number of applicants. Northeastern is located in Fenway, due south of Boston University. Northeastern is best known for it's co-op model of learning, which means students spend at least one semester as an intern, getting job experience right away.\nYet another great school is Tufts University, just north of the city in Medford. Tufts is basically a smaller version of Northeastern, with just 14,000 students.\nSimmons University  is located near BU\u2019s campus in Fenway, and is right next to the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. This university focuses almost entirely on women and offers a wide range of liberal arts degrees.\nFocusing on technical design and engineering, Wentworth Institute of Technology is located between the Simmons and Northeastern campuses in Fenway.\nTo the west of the city in Waltham, Brandeis University is another selective private college. It is known for its small class sizes and Jewish roots.\nYou'll find the fine arts are also well represented in Boston. Emerson College is dedicated exclusively to communication and the arts. It even has a great radio station to boot.\nBerklee College of Music is the largest independent college of contemporary music in the world. It's often confused with the completely unrelated Berkeley in California.\nOne of the oldest art schools, Massachusetts College of Art and Design (MassArt) is the only publicly funded art school in the United States.\nAdditional colleges in the area include the up and coming Bunker Hill Community College and Lesley University, state schools like UMass Boston and numerous suburban schools not already covered.\n \nRemember, the above is just an overview. If you're interested in pursuing higher education in the Boston area, keep digging to uncover plenty more offerings in Art, Architecture, Language, Law, Medicine, Music, Research, and Science. Don't forget about more affordable places like UMass Boston, or one of the many community colleges in town. The density of educational opportunities here work in your favor to provide big educations on small budgets.\n\n\n== Work ==\n\nBoston\u2014along with New England in general\u2014transitioned away from a manufacturing based economy to service based a long time ago. Many jobs in Boston require advanced degrees and years of specialized training. Those trying to join the workforce here will find themselves facing stiff competition for high-paying jobs. Many applicants for senior level positions will hold advanced degrees; you may find a masters degree, MBA, or even a PhD might be necessary for you to stand out. Even if you don't hold these qualifications, don't lose hope. Degrees are not universally required, and you'll find many professors and executives hiring a large support staff to assist them. Construction is also a booming business, but you'll have to somehow worm your way into a union to avail yourself of those jobs.\nHigher education is unsurprisingly a major employer here, with healthcare being another of the biggest industries. See the learn section for universities that are always hiring, or look at Longwood Medical Area in the Fenway, where many of the most distinguished hospitals are found. Longwood in particular employs tens of thousands of people at dozens of hospitals including: Beth Israel Deaconess, Brigham and Women's, Dana-Farber, Children's Hospital, and Harvard Medical School. Don't forget about Mass General Hospital in the West End, often ranked as the best in the country.\nOften spinning out of academia; startups, high tech and bio-tech have been big business in Boston for decades. There is a huge amount of venture capital here, the most outside the Bay Area. Companies like Formlabs, Runkeeper, and Hopper are but a few of the hundreds of startups active in the city. The highest concentration of incubators can be found within the Seaport Innovation District and Cambridge's Kendall Square. Established companies like Boston Dynamics, the Broad Institute, and Akamai are a few examples of successful \"startups\" from years past. Biotech companies today are concentrated in Cambridge and in the suburbs along Route 128.\nMultinational companies are becoming increasingly prominent in the city. Gillette (or Procter & Gamble) has been here for years, and in 2016 they welcomed their new neighbor General Electric. Financial services like Bain Capital, Liberty Mutual, Fidelity, and several hedge fund firms are downtown. For unknown reasons, sneaker companies seem to love Boston. Converse, New Balance, and Reebok all have headquarters within city limits. It's also likely your favorite Fortune 500 corporation has at least an outpost in Boston.\n\n\n== Buy ==\nIndividual listings can be found in Boston's district articles\nIf it exists in New England (and you can buy it), it exists in Boston. Sure, you can find the multinational staples you've come to expect across America, but many areas work to maintain an independent spirit that endures. Increasing real estate prices have put pressure on owners to \"sell out\", yet plenty of entrepreneurs have found a way to make their business work.\nOne of the first locations folks might visit is Quincy Market downtown. The shops here are pretty clearly oriented towards the tour bus crowd. It's not all snow globes, shot glasses, and post cards; however, there are a few novel trinkets here too. And don't forget about Boston Public Market in your quest either, it's just a block or so north. Alternatively, head over to Downtown Crossing, where many locals go for fast fashion and other affordable items.\nPerhaps the most visited shopping location is Newbury Street in the Back Bay. A dense avenue colored by historic brownstones, the shops and restaurants here are some of the finest in town. If price tags seem to contain a few zeros too many, it could be because you're near the Public Garden. Try walking west. You'll see your sticker shock gradually decrease the further you go. While you're over here, don't miss Boylston Street a few steps to the south. Many shops are proud to call this street home, and two gigantic high end shopping malls can be accessed from Boylston as well.\nOne of the more quaint shopping neighborhoods in Boston, Charles Street in Beacon Hill begins just north of the Common. The mix of storefronts here lends itself equally well to window shopping, as it does to picking up life's essentials. Multiple options for meals or just coffee, make this a pleasant and scenic stroll. If you are in town on a weekend, head over to the SoWa Open Market in the South End. This is a great chance to pick up some one of a kind handmade goods and take in some local color.\nIf you're shopping in Cambridge, make Harvard Square your first stop. Yeah, it's a little more corporate than you want it to be, but it's Harvard, and there are more than a few interesting shops remaining. If you find yourself in Brookline, head for Coolidge Corner. This area has the densest concentration of shops, restaurants, and entertainment in Brookline.\n\n\n== Eat ==\nIndividual listings can be found in Boston's district articles\nWhile the first thing on most visitors minds is the excellent seafood, Boston does have other high quality options. Many travellers find sitting down to a fine Italian meal in the charming North End neighborhood an unforgettable experience, while others may prefer to explore classic dining options littered throughout the Back Bay and South End. For an evening easier on the wallet, check out the wide variety of Asian restaurants found in either Chinatown or Allston. And if you're accustomed to taking meals late, make sure you account for the fact that many restaurants here can close by 10 or 11PM. Smoking is not permitted in any restaurant or bar in the metro Boston area.\nExamples of fine Boston cuisine often pull double duty as well known New England dishes. These are often thought of as traditional Thanksgiving foods, which makes sense considering the origins of the holiday. While the varieties of these foods served in the city may be more \"elevated\", examples found in the countryside are no less flavorful. Also, Boston baked beans are not really a thing anymore. If you are dead set on trying them, however, inspect the menus at some of the more touristy restaurants downtown.\n\n\n=== Seafood ===\n\nAtlantic Codfish: This foodstuff, prized by early colonists, is closely associated with dining in Boston. Cherished for its flavor, ability to be salted, and marketable value; the cod was overfished and stocks collapsed during the 1990s. Today you may be offered scrod instead, which could be haddock or some other white fleshed fish. They all honestly taste about the same (as long as they're fresh!), and by choosing to eat this \"trash fish\" you're helping to give this vulnerable animal time to recover.\nClam Chowder: Kind of like the New England version of pho in that every bowl is similar, yet each shop strives to put its own little spin on this traditional dish. No matter where you get it, you'll certainly find clams swimming in a thick creme broth, diced potatoes, onions, and celery. You might also see colorful garnishes, different kinds of crackers, or even whole clams in your bowl. You can be confident you're getting the best as long as tomatoes are never added, as they blasphemously do in a certain large city to the south.\nFried Clams: Another iconic regional dish, here the clams have been removed from their shells, dipped in batter and deep fried. Not particularly healthy, but always quite delicious. These are pretty ubiquitous as well, but they're purported to taste best when eaten outdoors at a picnic table of questionable cleanliness. See if you can hold out until you find one.\nLobster Roll: Ah, the eternal argument of who has the best lobster roll. A very popular way of eating lobster, because all the work is done for you. Preferred examples will have diced lobster meat soaked in butter, and are just kissed with mayonnaise and various seasonings. They must also be served on a toasted New England style bun, split along the top, not the side. Lobster rolls are usually served cold, so don't be surprised by that. If you see a roll piled with toppings and dripping with mayo, it's likely an inferior product.\nOysters: Bostonians love their oysters, and they're often offered after work for cheap, especially during happy hours. These bivalves can have different flavors and textures depending on the specific bay or inlet they're from. Oysters from Duxbury and Wellfleet are often the first on the list to run out. Garnishes tend to be a variety of choices, but cocktail sauce and lemons are always present. You'll usually see a few additional toppings, often with a spicier edge.\nSteamers: These are clams that have been steamed, unsurprisingly, in their own shells. Diners then scoop the meat out with a small fork and dip it briefly in butter before sucking them down. They'll also come with an array of other garnishes depending on where you find them.\n\n\n=== Desserts ===\n\nBoston Cream Pie: A true Boston original, and the official dessert of Massachusetts. Invented at the Parker House Hotel in 1856, you can still order a slice of this custard-filled yellow cake (not pie!) here today. If fine dining is a little rich for your tastes, try a version made by one of the nicer doughnut shops in town. It's the same idea. You could also go for the ubiquitous Dunkin' Donuts version, if you really don't want to expend any effort whatsoever.\nFluff: This confection is basically marshmallows liquified into a spreadable paste. Artificial and sickly sweet, it's often combined with peanut butter to make a \"Fluffernutter\" sandwich that is enjoyed by children of all ages throughout New England. So beloved is this sweet treat, that Somerville\u2014birthplace of Fluff\u2014dedicates an entire weekend festival to celebrating the stuff in late September. Grab a jar in any grocery store, or just keep a sharp eye on your menus. The Gallows in the South End uses it in their cr\u00e8me brul\u00e9e for example.\nIce Cream: New Englanders are some of the most prolific consumers of ice cream anywhere on earth, and Boston plays no small role in boosting those statistics. Not just a summertime treat, you'll see folks gobbling down artisanal varieties from across the region even in cold winter months. A few of the more notable local dairy slingers are: J.P. Licks, Emack and Bolio's, Toscanini's (Cambridge), The Ice Cream Smith, Picco, Ron's Gourmet Ice Cream... and that's just to start. There are scores more locations around Boston, with some also offering custard or gelato options.\n\n\n=== Drinks ===\nFrappe: A milkshake in New England is mostly milk, and not the drinkable ice cream you're looking for. Here that's still called a frappe, pushing back against a globalistic trend toward convergence. They're delicious whether you pronounce it \"frap\" or \"frap-PAY\", or even\u2014ugh\u2014milkshake. Some of the best are made at Lizzie's in Harvard Square, or try one of several UBurger locations. Many of the ice cream shops in town may make a good frappe as well.\nNew England IPA: Is this truly its own distinct style of beer, or not? The jury is still out on that one. If you can get a hold of this popular elixir, however, note its unpasteurized, cloudy and hazy appearance. You'll find traditional IPA bitterness muted in NEIPAs, as brewers work to bring out the smoother floral and fruity characteristics of the hops. Trillium is your best bet in the city to find it, but get in line early.\nRaspberry Lime Rickey: Traditionally made with raspberry syrup, club soda and fresh limes. Some modern versions will use sickly sweet Sprite and cheap artificial lime flavor instead, accept no substitutes! For a quality RLR try Bartley's Gourmet Burgers in Harvard Square, Sullavan's in Southie, or one of the various Tasty Burger locations around town. In general if you find yourself in a place that serves burgers and isn't overly fancy, they may serve one even if it's not on the menu.\n\n\n=== Food trucks ===\n\nSome of the best food available in Boston can be bought from a truck. Owing to sky high real estate prices, it can be cheaper and easier to get a food truck business started than a full on brick and mortar restaurant. Many entrepreneurs use trucks as a stepping stone to opening their own restaurant, so you'll see that some of these trucks also have permanent locations. Hundreds of trucks orbit the city, serving every style of cuisine imaginable. While many focus on lunch, more than a handful offer breakfast and dinner options as well.\nYou can find food trucks in many neighborhoods, with the highest concentrations being found along the Greenway and other hotspots downtown. Copley Square in the Back Bay is another place to look, and trucks will also appear at popular spots like SoWa market in the South End and Lawn on D in Southie. Trucks rotate locations annually, so check out this filterable list, kept up to date by the city of Boston. If you find yourself overwhelmed by all the options just put your faith in the locals and queue up in whichever line is longest.\n\nBon Me: The most prolific trucks in the city. Good selection of Vietnamese staples that can be eaten on the go. Also has several stationary locations.\nChicken & Rice Guys: Take a wild guess what they offer here. Middle Eastern inspired; so don't sleep on the lamb, it's great too! Pairs nicely with several of their flavorful sauces, especially the mint. Has a few permanent restaurants.\nClover: Technology infused American fast food. Everything is fresh and always changing; it has to be since they don't use freezers. Digital menus tell you exactly how long you'll wait for your order. Started by MIT alumni, they now have several locations now throughout the region.\nJamaica Mi Hungry: Fantastic truck offering the requisite spicy jerks, along with rice and peas, coconut milk and red beans, and other Jamaican specialties. Trucks only for now.\nMei Mei: Siblings turn out this stellar Chinese-American food that changes with the seasons; winning multiple awards since 2012. One brick and mortar location near BU.\nTenoch: The trucks are tiny, but the Mexican flavors are not. Top notch tacos, tortas, and burritos, but cash only. Has one other location in the North End. Yes, there is good Mexican in the North End.\n\n\n== Drink ==\nIndividual listings can be found in Boston's district articles\nBoston has a thriving nightlife and is known to be a drinking town. It's easy to hop from bar to bar, and you'll find venues catering to college students, businesspeople, and sports fanatics alike. There is no \"happy hour\" in Massachusetts, you can thank the Puritans (or maybe the politicians?) for that. Since after work discounted drinks are off the table, look for businesses to get creative with their incentives. You'll often see discounts on food instead; dollar oysters are particularly common.\nOne drawback to going out in Boston is how early everything closes. Most places shut down by 1AM, with only a few dozen locations in the city holding grandfathered 2AM closing licenses. This can work to your advantage if you're taking the T, since it stops running at 12:30AM anyway. All venues will be 21+, with one or two rare exceptions for the 18+ crowd. Smoking is not permitted in any restaurant or bar in the metro Boston area.\nIf you're on the look out for an authentic Irish pub, prepare to hoof it or prepare to be disappointed. Most bars and pubs throughout downtown and the Back Bay are a bit too polished and corporate to have that warm historic feeling. The closest thing you'll find downtown is Mr. Dooley's, everything else in the Faneuil Hall area is overtly touristy. J.J. Foleys is another decent option, found nearby in the South End neighborhood. If you're dedicated, head out to Jamaica Plain and visit Doyle's Cafe or really go for the gusto and hit up The Eire Pub in Dorchester. You'll certainly come away with a great story to tell if you make it all the way out to the Eire.\nSports bars? Look into either Canal Street in the West End near Boston Garden, or Landsdowne Street in the Fenway area. Looking for a trendy new spot with glass walls, roof decks and views? Why, the Seaport district of course. Boylston Street in the Back Bay will also scratch that itch. Want cheap places to drink? Lots of options? Head to intersection of Harvard and Brighton Ave in Allston Village. Both Central and Harvard Squares in Cambridge are similarly dense with bars.\n\n\n=== Breweries and distilleries ===\nUndoubtably the largest, the Samuel Adams Brewery in J.P. and Harpoon Brewery in South Boston both offer tours and tastings. Trillium is also in Southie and brews some of the most acclaimed suds in the states. If you're gluten-free (or just love apples!) try out Downeast Cider House in East Boston. Heading south into Dorchester you'll find two more breweries. The Dorchester Brewing Company has 20 taps serving fresh house beer and regional partner brews. Deadwood is a respectable little brewery making their own in house beer for thirsty bowlers. \nTo the north you'll find the excellent Lamplighter brewery in Cambridge, while Somerville offers Aeronaut, Slumbrew, Winter Hill Brewing Company, and Bantam Cider Company to whet your whistle. For the adventurous, some of the best beer can be found to the north of the city. Real estate is a bit cheaper, so folks can afford to take a little more risk up there. For great examples, check out Idle Hands in Malden or Mystic Brewery in Chelsea. Finally, Everett has several great options with Night Shift, Bone Up, and Down the Road breweries all making their mark.\nIf you're looking for something a little harder, Boston's got options. GrandTen Distilling in South Boston and Bully Boy Distillers in Roxbury offer tours and tastings. Short Path Distillery, also in Everett, focuses specifically on rum and gin.\n\n\n=== Coffee ===\nFew people whack down as many daily cups of coffee as Bostonians. In fact a 2015 study estimated that 15% of toddlers in Boston drink a little java alongside their parents. You can expect to find a lot of options in town. With an almost Orwellian presence Dunkin' Donuts\u2014founded in nearby Quincy\u2014dominates. You should be able to see at least two locations from anywhere your little legs can take you. More utilitarian coffee can also be found at Starbucks and other chains, although nothing is more popular than \"Dunks\". Order it \"regular\" for cream and sugar, and \"black\" for without.\nLooking for something a little more inspired? If you're downtown check out Gracenote or Ogawa; while Pavement Coffeehouse, Boston Common Coffee, Barrington Coffee Roasting, and Thinking Cup are great options in the Back Bay area and nearby neighborhoods. Almost every coffee shop in the North End is filled with ambiance and probably what you're expecting.\n\n\n== Sleep ==\n\nIndividual listings can be found in Boston's district articles\nBoston offers a wide range of accommodations, from budget options to mid-range hotels to luxurious penthouses in the sky. Most hotels are concentrated in the Back Bay, with many more options available in neighboring districts like the South End, the Seaport and Cambridge. If you're primarily focused on the Freedom Trail, aim for as central a location as you can afford. Otherwise look for any place near a T station, once you're behind the gate you can be pretty much anywhere in a half an hour.\nIf anything will blow your budget, it will be the accommodations. Boston has some of the most expensive real estate in the country, behind only the Bay Area and New York City. In July 2019 the average room in town cost $280 a night! The city is aware of the problem and more hotels are either planned or under construction. Your best bet is to book far in advance and keep popular dates in mind. It can be especially bad during May graduations and around back-to-school in early September. Prices drop in winter, although shoulder season is probably the better compromise.\nThere are a few hostels in town, and you can sometimes find more affordable accommodations in student-focused areas like Allston and the Fenway. Alternatively, get creative. Look up an old friend, crash someone's couch or browse your favorite room rental application. If you're staying a bit longer, a summer sublet might make a good option. Students returning home often have an extra 2-3 months on their lease that you could take over with a little paperwork.\n\n\n== Connect ==\nGreater Boston uses 10-digit dialing.  This means you must include the area code whenever you are making a call. The standard area code is 617, but some phone numbers, especially cell phones, use the new 857 overlay.\n\n\n== Stay safe ==\nIn Boston, like the rest of the country, dial 911 if there is an emergency. This free call will summon police, medical, and fire services to assist you.\nFor a major American city, Boston's crime rate is very low. Crimes like murder and identity theft are uncommon, but others like robbery, assault, and muggings are frequent in some areas.\nBig tourist attractions draw crowds, and said crowds may draw thieves, so keep your eye on more than just that entertaining street performer! The same rules apply if you plan on enjoying Boston's nightlife. Watch out late at night when bars and clubs are emptying of drunken revelers and, most importantly, students. Even if you're not drinking, younger folks may be, so look for erratic drivers and inebriated youth. \nAs one of the USA's premier sports cities, Boston houses some of the most passionate and righteous sports fans you will ever meet. With sports teams frequently competing for and winning titles, locals have every right to talk trash to other fanbases, regardless of where you come from and which team you support. Be especially careful when the Red Sox play the New York Yankees, the Celtics play the Sixers, Knicks or Lakers, and the Patriots play teams like the Bills, Giants, or Eagles. Wearing gear from those teams (or any non-Boston sports teams) in any part of town, especially in the vicinity of Fenway park, TD Garden, or Foxboro, is an open invitation to be verbally harassed by the locals. Although generally harmless and in good fun, as the night wears on and inhibitions are lowered, these encounters could become physical.\nWhile on the train or subway, know your stop. Try not to get too absorbed by your personal device, and look around. Take your headphones off. Use extra caution when exiting the train at night. Boston doesn't have too much of a problem with busking on the trains themselves, yet. Most T stations are staffed while open, so ask an attendant for help if you feel uncomfortable. As a very general rule of thumb, any place within a half a mile of a train or T station is likely to have undergone renovations since 2010,  and is probably fine.\nMore than other major cities, Boston has suffered from the opioid crisis. As of 2018, the area around the Boston Medical Center is the only area that should be avoided by tourists. Colloquially known as the Methadone Mile, this area is at the border of Roxbury and the South End, and has a high concentration of drug addicts pitched in tents and makeshift homeless shelters. Many poor souls struggling with opioid addiction make use of the programs and services only available here. These tightly packed buildings found at the intersection of Mass Ave and the Route 93 ramps are one of the few places in New England offering treatment. The folks here are mostly harmless; with a mixture of addicts trying to recover, dealers trying to sell, and police trying to keep order.\nDespite their murky depictions in countless movies and TV shows, South Boston, Dorchester, and Charlestown are not particularly dangerous areas. However, it is advised to avoid going there alone at night if you are not familiar with those areas.\nThere are a few blocks to the north and to the east of Franklin Park in Roxbury that should be avoided, as there is some lingering gang violence dotted around there, but it is usually retaliatory in nature and tourists are not always targeted. Some areas where extra caution is needed include Jamaica Plain, Mission Hill, and Mattapan. While they've had their share of seediness and violence over the years (especially the latter), things have started to slowly improve.\n\n\n== Cope ==\n\n\n=== Publications ===\n The Boston Globe. The Boston Globe is the biggest daily publication around. It is the most respectable of the daily broadsheets. \n The Boston Herald. The Herald is a tabloid publication. \n The Boston Metro. Published in many cities, The Boston Metro is free, filled with ads and designed to be read on the train in about 10-15 minutes. \n DigBoston. Free alternative weekly publication. \n Bay State Banner. The Banner is an independent newspaper geared toward the African-American community. \n Bay Windows. Bay Windows is an LGBT-oriented newspaper, published weekly. \n Sampan Newspaper. Pick up a copy of The Sampan to learn more about the history of Chinatown. \n Spare Change. This biweekly paper contains alternative news, arts features, interviews, fiction and poetry that are written by staff writers and journalists, as well as by people who are homeless. Copies of Spare Change are purchased by the homeless, who sell them to passerby for $2. \n\n\n=== Consulates ===\nHere is the quick rundown of consular services in Boston and Cambridge. This list isn't definitive, there are some consulates just a bit outside of the city.\n\n\n== Go next ==\nBoston has a unique location at the northern tip of the most densely populated area in the United States. From here it's easy to explore picturesque New England towns, charming seaside villages, and historic and natural parks galore.\n\n\n=== Greater Boston ===\n\nMostly, but not entirely within the city, visiting the Boston Harbor Islands offers a completely different take on life in the city if you have the time.  Accessible by ferry.\nYou didn't miss Cambridge, right? It's not part of Boston, but its museums, architecture, history, restaurants and shopping are not to be missed.  Accessible by MBTA's Red Line subway.\nHop the Red line to Adams National Historical Park in neighboring Quincy. This was the family home of John Adams and John Quincy Adams, the 2nd and 6th Presidents of the United States.\nPlenty of hiking and biking opportunities can be found near the city. To the north you'll find Middlesex Fells Reservation in Stoneham, while the Blue Hills Reservation is to the south in Milton.\nSpeaking of cycling, pick up the Minuteman Bike Trail\u2014a converted railroad track\u2014and follow it out to Bedford. Once you arrive, let your legs decide if you should keep going or turn back to Cambridge.\nHead west to Concord to find Walden Pond, a kettle pond once owned by Ralph Waldo Emerson. Here his friend and author, Henry David Thoreau penned his book Walden; or, Life in the Woods.  Take the Commuter Rail Fitchburg Line to Concord.\nNext, visit the site where \"the shot heard 'round the world\" was fired from the North Bridge in the Minute Man National Historical Park. It's in Lexington, where travellers will find a wealth of historical sites and small town charm.  Take the Red Line to Alewife and then MBTA bus #62 or #76 (or take the Minuteman Bikeway or Route 2 ).\nRight next door in Lincoln, you'll find the DeCordova Museum. It showcases modern art, with a focus on its many large outdoor sculptures. The nearby Gropius House was designed by Walter Gropius, father of the iconic Bauhaus art movement.  Take MBTA's Fitchburg Line (or Route 2 by car) to Lincoln.\nSite of the famous Salem Witch Trials, Salem has done a fantastic job holding on to its historical roots. Walking through the historic district it's easy to imagine how a life controlled by the tides might have been lived. It's a vibrant suburb that feels more like a small city of its own, bursting with many new shops and restaurants. Salem gets bonkers during October, and is a complete madhouse on Halloween.  Take MBTA's Newburyport/Rockport Line to Salem, or by car, take Route 1 to Route 128 and follow signs for Salem.\n\n\n=== Massachusetts ===\n\nThe North Shore is always a fantastic little getaway. Seaside villages like Gloucester and Rockport (among several others) are well known for their charm, art, and fresh seafood. Take Route 1 to Route 128 or I-95, or follow the Newburyport or Rockport lines.\nIf you're driving south, stop by Plimoth Plantation in Plymouth; an hour by car via I-93 south and Route 3. A living museum featuring a replica of the Mayflower, and dedicated to showcasing the manner in which the first Pilgrim colonists would have lived.\nBring the kids out to Old Sturbridge Village in Sturbridge. Another living museum, this time re-creating life in rural New England as it was lived after the Revolutionary War. One hour fifteen minutes from Boston by car via I-90.\nHead south to New Bedford for a sort of less touristy version of Salem. Learn about how the lucrative whaling industry forged the area's strong Portuguese and Cape Verdean connections. Filled with great museums and history, it's also famous as the location of Melville's classic novel, Moby Dick. It's a little over an hour by car without traffic (follow I-93 south to Route 24, then follow signs for New Bedford); commuter rail service to the city will be starting in 2023.\nFollow the crowd over the Sagamore Bridge and \"Escape to the Cape\". Take as much time as you need to soak up the breathtaking Cape Cod National Seashore.\nKing of the Cape, Provincetown is achingly beautiful, easily accessible from Boston, and the perfect jump off for the rest of your Cape Cod explorations.  Accessible by plane, bus or ferry.\nIf life on the ocean is more your style, don't miss Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket. The former is closer to the mainland, flashier and more built up. The latter is slightly smaller and more remote, often making for a more peaceful stay.\nDuring the summer months, the Boston Symphony Orchestra makes its home in Lenox at Tanglewood, which hosts classical music and some contemporary acts. 2\u00bd hours by car via i-90 west.\nIf you're in the Berkshires any time of year do not miss the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art. Called Mass MoCA for short, there are always fresh exhibits rotating through their colossal gallery spaces. Three hours away by car in North Adams (follow Route 2 to the end), the museum's presence is slowly dragging this old factory town back to life, with new restaurants, shops and breweries opening.\n\n\n=== New England ===\n\nIf you're headed toward Rhode Island, drive or take the train to Providence, a city with its own share of art and culture, excellent Italian food, and a charming downtown area; or get a load of the jaw-dropping mansions and the jazz festival in Newport. Walk by the beach at Newport to see estates so grand, they're basically why Americans have to pay income tax now. The whole state is roughly 45 to 90 minutes away depending on traffic -- take I-95 south or the Providence commuter rail.\nIn New Hampshire, the ocean town of Portsmouth is a historic seaport bursting at the seams with charm, restaurants and shopping. If you want to get more outdoors or feel more active, hike the White Mountains of New Hampshire. The 8.9-mile (13.4-km) Franconia Ridge Traverse takes all day and is one of the area's most popular treks. About 4 hours by car, Mount Washington State Park is another great option.\nVermont is filled with covered bridges and charming towns like Woodstock. But really, any rustic town makes the perfect base to take in the dramatic fall foliage as seasons change. You can sample some of the finest brews in America in Burlington, Vermont's largest town. Many other fine brewers are in the countryside nearby. 3hr 30min by car.\nIf you're in New Hampshire, keep heading northeast into Maine to find Portland. The largest city in Maine also offers some of its best options for dining, drinking, and dancing. If you're looking for the outdoors, spend a day or a week at Acadia National Park. This superlative park boasts some of the most spectacular coastal landscapes in all New England. A 5-hour drive from Boston without traffic.\nConnecticut is past Providence on Interstate 95 and offers Mystic, a popular tourist destination offering an aquarium, beaches, and beluga whales; the culturally diverse city of New Haven; major Indian casinos; and some semi-large cities that are part of Greater New York City. New York City is about a 4-hour drive without traffic from Boston.\n\n\n=== Beyond ===\nTravel by bus, plane, or train to arrive at the greatest American city, New York.\nIf you're instead looking for towers of green, just a three-hour drive from Boston will place you within the Hudson Valley and Catskills.\nDrive north into Canadian province Quebec. The province's biggest city, Montreal, is 5 hours away by car, while the provincial capital, Quebec City, is 6.5 hours away.\nIf you prefer to travel the slow way, start (or finish) hiking the Appalachian Trail in Baxter State Park, Maine.\nAlso, you can drive about 5 hours or take a 1 1/2-hour flight to the Adirondacks. Just take Interstate 90 (Massachusetts Turnpike) west to Albany then take Interstate 87 North.\nBoston is also the beginning of a huge megalopolis, the Bos-Wash Corridor, that stretches all the way to Washington, D.C., which is an 8-hour drive or train ride away."

        "title": "San Francisco",
        "extract": "The centerpiece of the Bay Area, San Francisco is one of the most visited cities in the world, and with good reason. The cultural center of northern California, San Francisco is renowned for its mixture of scenic beauty and unique culture that makes it one of the most vibrant and desirable cities in the nation, if not the world.\nSandwiched between the San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean on a small square of land seven miles (11 km) on each side, San Francisco offers a wealth of treasures for the visitor, from the windswept and often foggy bay to the steep hills lined with Victorian homes that overlook the spectacular scenery of the city. Great ethnic and cultural diversity shows itself in the city's varied neighborhoods, from the crowded and exciting streets of Chinatown to the eclectic attitudes of the Castro and the gleaming condominium towers built on the city's more recently gained tech-savvy reputation.\nAnd yet San Francisco is just one of the cities which makes up the entire San Francisco Bay Area.  At the center of a metropolitan area of 9.7 million people (2018), the city is a fantastic base to explore the treasures of San Francisco's neighbors to the east across the Bay Bridge, to the north past the Golden Gate Bridge, and to the south down the peninsula. There's enough to see that one could devote a lifetime to exploring the region, and it'll become clear why people continue to make their way to this special place. \n\n\n== Districts ==\nEach district of San Francisco carries its own unique and distinct culture. This map is predominantly based on the 11 official governmental districts of San Francisco, but it has been adapted to suit the purposes of this travel guide. Some districts of particular interest to travelers have been broken up into popular neighborhood groupings, while others, mainly residential districts, have been merged.\n\n\n== Understand ==\n\n\n=== History ===\nPrior to European settlement in the area, the peninsula that now contains San Francisco was home to the Yelamu tribe, who were part of the larger Ohlone language group which stretched south from the Bay Area to the Big Sur of California. Due to San Francisco's characteristic foggy weather, the earliest European explorers completely bypassed what would later be called the Golden Gate and the San Francisco Bay. The first European settlement in the area was founded by the Spanish in 1776 as a mission community surrounding the Mission San Francisco de As\u00eds, in what is today called the Mission Dolores in the Mission District. In addition to the mission, a military fort was built near the Golden Gate: El Presidio.\nUpon gaining independence from Spain in 1821, the area became part of Mexico. Under Mexican rule, the mission system gradually came to an end and private ownership of land became a possibility. In 1835, an Englishman named William Richardson founded the town of Yerba Buena, the first significant settlement on the peninsula outside of the Mission Dolores area. As the new settlement gradually grew, Yerba Buena developed a street plan and became attractive to settlers. Following the Mexican-American War the United States claimed California, and in July 1846 the U.S. Navy arrived to raise the American flag above Yerba Buena. Over the next couple of years, California officially became part of the United States and the name of the town was changed from Yerba Buena to San Francisco.\nIn 1848 the California Gold Rush started in the Sierra Nevada mountains. Prior to the opening of the Transcontinental Railroad, getting to San Francisco involved an arduous overland journey or a lengthy voyage by sea, but that didn't stop waves of fortune-seeking immigrants from making the trip, increasing the city's population from a few thousand to hundreds of thousands. Many who made their fortunes then settled in San Francisco, which at the time was the largest, most exciting city in California. Like other large cities, eventually San Francisco developed into districts by nationality or social status: the Italians in North Beach, the Chinese in Chinatown, and the wealthy mining and railroad titans on Nob Hill; the city's Chinese name, \u820a\u91d1\u5c71, literally \"Old Gold Mountain\", reflects this heritage as a gold rush town. During the gold rush years many major businesses were created and flourished in San Francisco (Wells Fargo Bank, Levis, Bank of America), and famous and infamous personalities alike settled in the city. Of course, with all this success came problems: the rapid growth of the city outstripped any efforts at city planning, meaning proper sanitation and infrastructure were largely undeveloped, which led to a cholera outbreak in 1855. Violence and corruption were evident, and anti-immigrant violence resulted in many race riots.\n\nIn the 1890s, there was a large campaign to modernize and beautify the city, the success of which led some officials to proudly call San Francisco the \"Paris of the West.\" But in 1906, a devastating earthquake shook the city and a resulting fire leveled much of the city (in fact, almost 90% of the total damage was from the fire, and not from the quake). Nevertheless, officials at the time immediately set out on a plan to rebuild the city, with new parks, boulevards, the current civic center complex, and landmarks such as the Coit Tower atop Telegraph Hill. In 1915, San Francisco hosted the Panama-Pacific Exposition (where the Palace of Fine Arts complex is now) to showcase the completely rebuilt city. The Balclutha, a ship that traveled to Oregon to acquire lumber for this purpose, is now docked in San Francisco as a museum and venue for historical reenactors to educate elementary-school students.\nIn the wake of the Great Depression of the 1930s, San Francisco remained largely unscathed. In fact, it was during this time that the Golden Gate Bridge and the Bay Bridge were conceived and built. It was also during this time that the federal government established a prison on Alcatraz Island, which would hold some of the most notorious criminals of the era.\nAfter World War II, San Francisco continued to grow in population. Aggressive urban planning projects led to a changing skyline, with more highrises in the city's financial district and new freeways rimming the city's waterfront. But in some sense the years after World War II were also unique in what didn't happen; while cable cars were once commonplace throughout North America, San Francisco remains the last place to still have them in daily use as actual transportation. Sprawl and auto-centric development have also happened in San Francisco, but less so than in most other American cities and it is therefore still one of the best destinations to explore the United States without a car. In later years, the waterfront freeways were deemed an eyesore and eventually torn down and replaced with the far more pleasant Embarcadero Boulevard.\nBesides being a beautiful city to visit, from the 1950s forward San Francisco became known as the city of the cool, quirky, unusual, and counterculture. There were the Beatniks of the 1950s and 60s, and the hippies in the 1960s and 70s. \"Only in San Francisco\" became part of the lexicon to describe San Francisco's counterculture and rebel population, a reputation that still exists today. The film industry also made San Francisco world-famous and instantly recognizable; the city provides a superb backdrop for a movie, regardless of genre or topic.\nSince 2000, San Francisco has experienced a development boom. Even with the burst of the dot-com bubble, the economy has remained robust and the city government pushed for redevelopment of its blighted industrial section known as \"South of Market\". Today, the SoMa area is crowded with new condominium and office buildings, new tourist attractions, and dot-com industries. The city's efforts shielded it somewhat from the 2008 recession and subsequent real estate crash. Today the financial sector is second only to tourism as San Francisco's largest industry, with the city consistently remaining at the top five of the world's most popular tourist destinations. The rise of Silicon Valley and high-tech industries have also contributed significantly to San Francisco's economy, with many tech workers living in San Francisco but commuting to the rest of the Bay Area for work. San Francisco is not without its problems, however, as the large influx of high-income university-educated professionals in the tech and finance sectors has also led to skyrocketing rents and consumer prices, which have made San Francisco among the most expensive cities in the world, and driving many long-time low-income residents into homelessness.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\"The coldest winter I ever spent was a summer in San Francisco.\" \u2014 attributed to Mark Twain\n\nThe best time to visit San Francisco is late September through October, when it is relatively the warmest. All year long, it never gets too cold for winter clothing, and it rarely gets warm enough for shorts and sandals. You will typically need a sweater after sunset, and a windbreaker if you're out by the western part of the peninsula. Prepare to dress in layers to adequately face the microclimates\u2013\u2013wind and temperature conditions can change within less than a mile's walk.\nSan Francisco has a mild climate, with cool, wet winters and dry summers. In most months, you can expect the high temperature to be in the upper 50s, 60s or low 70s \u00b0F (15-25 \u00b0C). However, these mild temperature readings belie a unique climate not shared by other major cities in the state or country.\nSummer days usually start out under fog, slowly burning off towards the ocean into a sunny albeit windy afternoon. Measurable precipitation during the summer months is rare, although light drizzle is possible. Humidity is very constant, but rarely uncomfortable. At late afternoon, when the fog and wind returns people generally find themselves needing a jacket (and this is summer!). There are some days when the fog lingers all day. Daylight lasts from 6AM to 8:30PM.\nIn the winter, the rainy season is in full swing. That being said, the chances for a calm, windless, sunny day are actually higher in the winter than in the summer! However, the overall temperatures are going to be lower in the winter. There have long been one-week warm spells in February. In the last couple years (2021-2022), these have gotten longer, lasting through February and even into January. The sun is only up from 7:15AM to 5PM.\nSpring and fall are not so much seasons in themselves in San Francisco, but rather they are quick transitional periods with some days resembling summer and others the winter. Fall in particular is a good time to visit because the summer wind & fog has mostly gone, but the rainy season has not yet started. The late summer month of September, as summer transitions into fall, is the warmest and driest month of the entire year for San Francisco. Heat waves can occasionally occur around this time of year.\nWithin these general rules, San Francisco also has a series of microclimates created by the city's topography and maritime setting. Large hills in the city's center block much of the fog, wind, and precipitation that rolls in from the Pacific Ocean. Because of this, there can be significant weather differences in different parts of the city and the surrounding Bay Area at the same time. Generally, the more windward areas along the coast (e.g., the Outer Sunset) are cooler and foggier, while the more leeward areas in the east are warmer and drier (e.g., the Mission). Temperature differences of 10-15 degrees Fahrenheit or so are common on days where the fog persists on the western side of the city. These differences continue as you move east, out of the city, into the East bay, and into the outer East Bay (on the other side of the hills from Berkeley and Oakland), where it can be much hotter and drier. Local meteorologists routinely have three forecasts: one for the coast, one for the bay, and one for the inland areas. In short, if you don't like the weather, perhaps travel a few miles east or west to your desired climate.\n\n\n=== Read ===\nSan Francisco literature finds its roots in the city's long and often tumultuous history, its diversity, and its attraction to eclectic characters; the city was a major center for the Beat poetry movement and seems to also hold an uncanny attraction for science fiction writers. Among the most famous works set in San Francisco:\n\nJack Kerouac spent a lot of time in San Francisco, and portions of two of his most influential works are set here: On the Road and The Dharma Bums. Both are accounts of Kerouac examining his place in the universe; the first a tale of a man traveling the country, the second a story of someone looking for the simple life.\nThe Maltese Falcon, Dashiell Hammett. A gripping detective novel set in San Francisco that would come to define the private detective genre. The novel follows private eye Sam Spade as he tries to retrieve a valuable bird figurine, and has been adapted into film twice, including one where Spade was played by none other than Humphrey Bogart.\nTales of the City, Armistead Maupin. A famous series which offers an excellent look into 1970s San Francisco, particularly the city's counter culture and alternative lifestyles.\nGonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson lived in the Western Addition in the mid-60s and the city appears in many of his books and articles.\nPhilip K. Dick spent much of his life in the San Francisco area, and among his novels set here are Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, set in a post-apocalyptic near future where androids serve humankind and bounty hunters are called in to \"retire\" androids that become too independent, and The Man in the High Castle, an alternate universe novel where Japan and Germany won World War II.\nThe Bridge trilogy (Virtual Light, Idoru, and All Tomorrow's Parties), William Gibson. Set in a futuristic San Francisco following a massive earthquake, in which the city has been rebuilt using nanotechnology and a race is on to control the new cyberspace technology.\nAltered Carbon, Richard K. Morgan. Also set in a futuristic San Francisco, where human personalities can be stored digitally and downloaded into new bodies.\nThe Crying of Lot 49, Thomas Pynchon. A renowned novel which follows a woman who sinks into paranoia as she attempts to unravel a worldwide conspiracy.\nThe Joy Luck Club, Amy Tan. A story of four Chinese American immigrant families who start a club and spend their time playing the Chinese game of Mahjong and tell of their struggles in traveling to America.\nThe Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test, Tom Wolfe. A nonfictional account which perfectly captures the Hippie movement, following a band of psychedelic drug users across the country in their painted school bus.\nBarbary Coast, Herbert Asbury. For a nonfictional work on the tumultuous early history of San Francisco, this is an excellent choice.\n\n\n=== Watch ===\nSan Francisco has been the backdrop for many films, due in part to the Bay Area's vibrant filmmaking community and the city's proximity to Hollywood. The production companies of George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola, along with the animation company Pixar are just a few of the big players who call the San Francisco area home. Among the better films set in San Francisco:\n\nThe Maltese Falcon (John Huston, 1941).  Humphrey Bogart stars as a San Francisco private detective dealing with three unscrupulous adventurers who compete to obtain a fabulous jewel-encrusted statuette of a falcon.\nDark Passage (Delmer Daves, 1947). An offbeat film noir featuring two icons of the genre, Lauren Bacall and Humphrey Bogart. The city's dark alleyways and side streets are on prominent display throughout the eccentric story of a man wrongly accused of murder and an enigmatic woman who lives in a lavish art deco apartment on top of the Filbert Steps.\nVertigo (Alfred Hitchcock, 1958). While it's not the only Hitchcock film set in San Francisco (portions of The Birds are set here), Vertigo really packs in a lot the city, following a private investigator who suffers from acrophobia as he uncovers the mystery of one woman's peculiar behavior and travels from one San Francisco landmark to the next.\nBullitt (Peter Yates, 1968). A very popular and highly influential crime thriller starring Steve McQueen (who also starred in the locally-set The Towering Inferno) and featuring one of the best car chase scenes in the history of cinema.\nPsych-Out (Richard Rush, 1968). An incredibly trippy film with psychedelic music (including an appearance from Strawberry Alarm Clock), recreational drugs, and Haight-Ashbury \u2014 Hippies aplenty in this one.\nDirty Harry (Don Siegel, 1971). Another cop film set in San Francisco (in addition, all but one of the sequels were also set here), starring Clint Eastwood chasing down sadistic killers and asking people if they feel lucky. Well do they, punk?\nInvasion of the Body Snatchers (Philip Kaufman, 1978). Emotionless drones impersonating people and hatched from pods take over San Francisco in this classic science fiction flick.\nA whole host of great films have been set at Alcatraz; among them are Escape from Alcatraz (Don Siegel, 1979), Birdman of Alcatraz (John Frankenheimer, 1962), The Rock (Michael Bay, 1996), and the very influential Point Blank (John Boorman, 1967).\n48 Hrs. (Walter Hill, 1982). Often credited with starting the buddy-cop genre, this flick follows a hot-headed cop who has to team up with a wisecracking convict in order to find two cop killers in the crime-ridden underworld of San Francisco.\nChan Is Missing (Wayne Wang, 1982). Illustrating the problems experienced by Chinese-Americans, this film tells the story of two taxi drivers searching Chinatown for a man who ran off with their money.\nStar Trek IV: The Voyage Home (Leonard Nimoy, 1986). In the 23rd century, San Francisco is the home of Starfleet Command and humpback whales have long been extinct. In this installment of the popular franchise, Kirk, Spock, and the rest of the crew have to time travel to a more contemporary San Francisco to bring back a couple of whales and save Earth.\nMilk (Gus Van Sant, 2008). A biopic on the life of Harvey Milk, the former San Francisco City Supervisor in the late 1970s and the first openly gay man to be elected to public office. This story still holds sway for many San Franciscans given the city's role in the ongoing gay rights movement.\nLa Mission (Peter Bratt, 2009). Ultra-macho ex-con Che Rivera learns the true meaning of being a father when he discovers his son is gay. Low-key, intimate cinematography of the Mission District abounds in this film.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nSan Francisco is known for its Victorian architecture, particularly in the central and northern neighborhoods (e.g., Haight-Ashbury, Alamo Square, Noe Valley, Castro, Nob Hill, and Pacific Heights). The city has one of the most restrictive building and planning codes in the world, which helps preserve the historical architecture in certain areas and create a severe shortage of housing stock, which drives up the price of housing. The exorbitant price of housing, both buying and renting, is a favorite topic of San Francisco locals. It helps to explain why there are so few families in San Francisco (another favorite topic).\nSan Francisco has also undergone high-rise construction boom centered in SoMa, just south of what was historically the center of downtown. This was one of the few areas of the city left for development (i.e. without entrenched anti-development policies). Unlike other major cities like New York and Chicago, San Francisco is not known for having buildings built by star architects. This may be due to the difficulty of getting projects approved in the city.\n\n\n=== Culture ===\nSan Francisco prides itself on its openness to diversity in race, gender, sexual orientation and personal style.  This trait is widely considered to be one of the defining features of the city, and it draws both visitors and transplants alike.\nTobacco smokers beware: as in the rest of California, smoking is illegal in bars, restaurants, and other public places. Additionally, the City of San Francisco has a local ordinance that require smokers to go all the way to the curb (or if there is no curb, at least 25 feet from any building - not simply the entrances). Bay Area people can be particularly vocal about personal habits, so take care and be mindful and respectful of others when smoking, even in places where it is allowed.\nOn the other hand, smoking marijuana is remarkably well-tolerated. While still illegal under federal law, California law allows for the possession, use, and cultivation of small amounts of marijuana for adults 21 and over. Using marijuana in public is illegal, but this rarely enforced. You shouldn't smoke marijuana just anywhere, and the rules of etiquette are difficult to navigate. You might find people smoking marijuana at large concerts, but not small concerts, or people smoking marijuana on a street corner in the middle of the day in some neighborhoods (e.g., Haight-Ashbury) but frowned upon in others (e.g., the Financial District).\nPublic nudity has been celebrated among some residents. However, this has not been without controversy, and there is now a law banning some public nudity, with nudists actively opposing the law.\nIt's worth mentioning that natives tend to dislike many of the nicknames given to their city. Instead of saying \"San Fran\", \"Frisco\", or \"SFO\", most refer to San Francisco by its full name or just \"The City\".\nThe Bay Area has of one of the most vibrant high-tech startup scenes in the world. While the venture capital firms are largely in the South Bay, many of the small startups and tech workers are in San Francisco. In addition, most of the financial institutions serving the tech companies of Silicon Valley are based in San Francisco.\n\n\n=== Tourist information ===\nSan Francisco's visitor information centers offer maps, brochures and other information for tourists.\n\n San Francisco Visitor Information Center, 900 Market St (next to the cable car turnaround at Market & Powell, near Union Square), \u260f +1-415-391-2000, fax: +1-415-362-7323. May through October: M-F 9AM-5PM, Sa-Su and holidays 9AM-3PM. November through April: M-F 9AM-5PM, Sa and holidays 9AM-3PM. Closed Easter, Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day, and New Year's Day. Visitor center run by the San Francisco Convention & Visitors Bureau. \n California Welcome Center, Fisherman's Wharf, Pier 39, Building P, Second Level, \u260f +1-415-981-1280, info@pier39.com. One of several California Welcome Centers across the state. \n\n\n== Talk ==\nEnglish is the dominant language spoken in San Francisco. San Francisco is home to the second largest Chinese community in the United States after New York City, and Cantonese is commonly spoken in the various Chinese-dominated neighborhoods, with an increasing Mandarin-speaking minority. Like much of California, there is also a large Latin American population, so Spanish is also commonly spoken in San Francisco, especially in the Mission District. In addition, there is also a large Filipino community, and Tagalog is commonly heard in Filipino neighborhoods. Most municipal government services are available in English, Cantonese, Spanish and Tagalog.\n\n\n== Get in ==\n\n\n=== By plane ===\n1 San Francisco International Airport (SFO IATA), \u260f +1-800-435-9736. Located about 10 mi (16 km) south of the city, is the Bay Area's major international airport (and one of the busiest in the nation) and has numerous passenger amenities including a wide range of food and drink establishments, shopping, baggage storage, public showers, a medical clinic, and assistance for lost or stranded travelers and military personnel. SFO has four terminals; as a rule of thumb, Alaska Airlines and American Airlines use Terminal 2, United Airlines has Terminal 3, most other domestic carriers use Terminal 1, and all foreign airlines use the International Terminal. SFO is infamous for its weather delays, so check if Oakland Airport has service from your origin as well. Oakland is closer to Downtown San Francisco than SFO is and fog free.   (updated Sep 2019)\n2 Oakland International Airport (OAK IATA), \u260f +1-510-563-3300. In the East Bay provides service to numerous destinations in the United States as well as Mexico. Oakland is primarily used by low-cost carriers, and is a major hub for Southwest Airlines. BART provides metro service to SF.   (updated Sep 2019)\n3 Norman Y. Mineta San Jose International Airport (SJC IATA), \u260f +1-408-277-4759. In Silicon Valley about 1 hour south of San Francisco, attracts Bay Area residents who find SFO to be inconveniently distant from their homes. Southwest Airlines is the dominant carrier here as well, but a number of long-haul international carriers serve the airport as well.   (updated Sep 2019)\nOakland and San Jose tend to offer more discount airline flights, while San Francisco Airport attracts more international flights and can be more convenient for those staying in the city. Private pilots should consider Oakland (OAK IATA) rather than SFO, as the separate general aviation field there is more accommodating to light aircraft.\n\n\n==== Public airport transportation ====\nSan Francisco and Oakland Airports are connected to downtown SF by the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system.\nPassengers arriving in SFO can walk (5 minutes from United's domestic terminal) or take a free airport shuttle (AirTrain) to the BART station (which is adjacent to the G side of the International Terminal). The BART ride from SFO to San Francisco's downtown stations costs $8.95 one-way and runs frequently, every 15 or 20 minutes depending on the time of day. BART trains run through San Bruno, South San Francisco, Colma, and Daly City before reaching the city of San Francisco, from where the SF MUNI can take travelers anywhere in the city. BART operates to midnight from 4AM on weekdays, 6AM on Saturdays and 8AM on Sundays.\nSFO is also connected to San Francisco by SamTrans routes 292, 397, and 398. Routes 292, 397, and 398 are $2 to San Francisco and they are operating non-stop.\nFrom Oakland Airport, passengers can take a people mover to the BART station and continue there directly to San Francisco. The fare from Oakland Airport to downtown San Francisco via the people mover and BART is $10.20 (of which the connector comprises $6). The total fare will automatically be deducted from your Clipper Card.\nThe San Jose airport is served by a free shuttle to both VTA Light Rail and Caltrain called the Airport Flyer \u2014 VTA Route #10. Passengers arriving in San Jose can use Caltrain to reach San Francisco directly (this costs $7.50 one-way). Caltrain also links with the BART system at the Millbrae intermodal station. When riding Caltrain, use a Clipper card or buy your ticket at the automated station kiosks before boarding, as they are not sold on the trains.\n\n\n==== Private airport transportation ====\nTaxis are considerably more expensive than the public transportation options. A taxi from SFO to the city can easily cost more than $40, and over $60 from OAK. Ride sharing services such as Uber or Lyft can be as low as $35 to/from SFO and $40 to OAK at low traffic times, but can be more expensive than a regular taxi at busy times. Pickups from both airports are in different locations than the taxis - at departures (not arrivals) at SFO, and at the signposted \"Smartphone App Rides\" section at 2E on the second curb away from arrivals at OAK. Taxi and van prices from San Jose to San Francisco are significantly higher, easily over $100. Shared vans will cost around $14. If you plan to drive from a car rental area near the SFO airport to downtown San Francisco, you can take the 101 freeway. When returning a rental car to SFO, remember to take the rental car exit, otherwise you will have to wind your way slowly back to the rental car center.\n\n\n=== By train ===\nAmtrak, +1-800-872-7245 serves the Bay Area with long-distance and intercity trains. San Francisco's long distance station is across the bay, outside city limits, in Emeryville. Passengers can arrive in 4 Emeryville.    or Oakland's 5 Jack London Square Station.  in the East Bay and may take an Amtrak Thruway bus over the Bay Bridge to San Francisco's Amtrak stops just outside the Salesforce Transit Center at Mission & Fremont St; the Embarcadero Center (Drumm & California St) in the Financial District; Pier 39 in Fisherman's Wharf, and at several other downtown destinations (Amtrak passengers are not subjected to any extra charge for the bus). Travelers on some shorter distance Amtrak routes can also transfer to BART trains at the Richmond or Oakland Coliseum stations. Alternatively, riders approaching the Bay Area from the south may transfer to Caltrain at San Jose's Diridon Station for a direct ride to Fourth and King Streets in San Francisco.  A particularly scenic method is to disembark at Jack London Square and take the ferry (San Francisco Bay Ferry) to San Francisco.\nAmtrak routes serving the Bay Area are:\n\nThe California Zephyr runs daily between Chicago and Emeryville with connections to/from the east coast. This is widely considered to be the most scenic of Amtrak's routes.\nThe Coast Starlight runs daily between Seattle, Portland, Emeryville, and Los Angeles. To reach San Francisco, either transfer to Caltrain in San Jose or to the Amtrak bus in Emeryville.\nThe Capitol Corridor runs 16 times daily (11 on weekends and holidays) between Sacramento and Emeryville, with some trains continuing to San Jose. Caltrain is the best bet to get between San Jose and San Francisco, but the most convenient transfer to San Francisco is via the Amtrak bus at Emeryville or to BART at either the Richmond station north of Emeryville or the Oakland Coliseum station for trains continuing south of Emeryville.\nThe San Joaquins runs 5 times daily between Bakersfield, Stockton and Emeryville. Travelers on the San Joaquins can continue on to San Francisco via the Amtrak bus at Emeryville or by transferring to the BART at the Richmond station.\nThere are two regional rail systems which serve San Francisco:\nCaltrain, +1-510-817-1717 operates a regional rail service from San Jose to its San Francisco terminal at Fourth and King in SoMa. The service also runs between San Jose and Gilroy during rush hour. Caltrain is very useful for travel between San Francisco and communities on the Peninsula, Silicon Valley or South Bay. On weekdays Caltrain provides two trains per hour for most of the day but run more during commute hours, including \"Baby Bullet\" limited services that cruise between San Francisco and San Jose in 57 minutes; on weekends and public holidays trains run hourly, except that after 10PM only one train runs, leaving at midnight. The 4th & King terminal is served by Muni Metro (see 'Get around') giving connections to the rest of the city. Fares vary depending on how far you go. Tickets must be purchased before boarding the train from ticket vending machines at any of the stations or from ticket clerks at staffed stations. Tickets are checked on the trains and anyone found without a ticket is liable to a substantial fine. Cyclists should use the designated car at the northern end of the train; bike space is often limited during commute hours.\nBay Area Rapid Transit (BART), +1-415-989-2278 provides a regional frequent rail service connecting much of the East Bay with San Francisco and the San Francisco Airport through the Transbay Tube, a tunnel underneath San Francisco Bay. BART operates five routes, of which four run through San Francisco. There are three or four trains per hour on each route; consequently trains within San Francisco are generally less than a 5-minute wait. In the East Bay, BART runs mostly on elevated track; in downtown San Francisco it runs in a subway under Market Street, and several underground stations provide easy access to downtown areas and simple transfers to the Muni Metro subway. BART also meets Caltrain at Millbrae. Bicycles are allowed on BART except between stations designated in the schedule brochure during commute hours. Fares vary depending with distance traveled, and start at $1.75 for trips within the city. Fares are payable only by Clipper card (or its smartphone equivalent), which you can buy at BART stations and which holds a balance, deducting the appropriate price for each trip. The BART vending machines accept any credit card only twice within any 24 hour period.\n\n\n=== By bus ===\n6 Salesforce Transit Center (formerly Transbay Terminal), 425 Mission (Huge multi-block complex bounded by Mission, Howard, Beale and 2nd Streets. Marker at approximately where the main entrance at (Minna St & Shaw Alley).). The location serves as a mall, bus station and an outdoor park at the roof top. The bus station is served by Greyhound, AC Transit, Golden Gate Transit, MUNI and WestCat Lynx, SamTrans & Capitol Corridor/Amtrak Thruway are at Fremont & Mission St. Other intercity bus companies have their own bus stops in different parts of the city. Check schedules and websites:.   (updated Sep 2019)\n\n FlixBus (Operated by TourCoach to L.A. & Universal Limo to Sacramento; and by Greyhound Lines), (bus stop) 5th & Townsend St (Bus will board on the south side of the intersection of Townsend St and 5th St. The stop is at a white curbside designated by a green FlixBus sign. Across the street is the \"User Testing\" building and several bike racks.). They also have additional stops at the Daly City BART station (500 John Daly Blvd) and next to the Beach & Hyde St Cable Car station at Fisherman's Wharf (700 Beach St). Goes east to Sacramento via UC Berkely, W Oakland BART and UMall in Davis; and south to Los Angeles via San Jose, Gilroy and Avenal. Some continue from Los Angeles to Ontario via Claremont. (updated Aug 2018)\n Greyhound Lines, Salesforce Transit Center (Bus deck level 3.), \u260f +1-415-495-1569, toll-free: +1-800-231-2222. Greyhound travels to the Bay Area primarily on US Hwy 101/I-280 (Arcata-San Francisco and Los Angeles-Santa Barbara-San Francisco on two separate routes); Interstate 80 (San Francisco-Sacramento-Reno); I-580/CA Hwy 99 (San Francisco-Modesto-Bakersfield-Los Angeles); and Interstate 5 (San Francisco-San Jose-Coalinga Jct]-Los Angeles). Passengers can transfer to other buses in San Jose, Reno, Bakersfield, Oakland, Sacramento, Fresno and Los Angeles to get to other cities and towns. Local connections are through West Oakland BART station for north, and westbound buses towards Arcata and Sacramento. Additional local connections are through San Jose Diridon Station via Hayward BART and West Oakland BART on I-580 for southbound buses going towards Los Angeles or Bakersfield. (updated Oct 2015)\nSome of the above long-distance bus companies also make stops in Oakland and San Jose (and/or additional Bay Area cities) to pick up passengers on the outbound trip and drop off on the inbound trip.\nSeveral regional bus systems serve San Francisco from the surrounding areas in the greater Bay Area. 511.org compiles information from all of the Bay Area's different regional bus, train and ferry systems into one site including a handy trip planner program. Basic services are provided to major destinations or cities at all times, with the greatest amount of service provided during rush hour into SF in the morning and leaving at night. The bus services share a central San Francisco terminal at the Transbay Terminal in SoMa on Beale St between Mission and Howard Streets and/or at different locations in the Tenderloin, SoMA, or the Union Square/Financial District. Check schedules and websites as to where your bus is at:\n\nAC Transit, +1-510-891-4700, from Oakland, Berkeley, Alameda, and other cities on the western parts of Alameda and Contra Costa Counties in the East Bay on multiple routes.\nGolden Gate Transit, +1-415-455-2000, from Sonoma and Marin counties, in the North Bay, north of the Golden Gate Bridge. Routes 101, 130, 150 & 172 terminate at the Salesforce Center while routes #114, 132 and 154 terminate at 4th & Folsom. Route 580 connects San Rafael in Marin County to El Cerrito del Norte BART Station via Richmond.\nSamTrans, +1-510-817-1717, from San Mateo County and SFO (Airpoort) in the peninsula, south of San Francisco.\nWestCAT 'Lynx', +1-510-724-7993, from Hercules and Pinole in Contra Costa County, northeast of Oakland. The 'Lynx' route provides a transbay express service from the Salesforce Transit Center to Hercules Transit Center. Additional 'JL', 'JR', 'JX' and 'JPX' routes connect El Cerrito del Norte BART to Hercules Transit Center. See schedules and route maps for differences in the routes.\nThe El Cerrito del Norte BART Station (via 'Red line' train towards Richmond from downtown SF) is the next nearest connection point to downtown San Francisco for the following:\n\nSolano Express (STA) +1-707-424-6025, from Sacramento via Davis, Vacaville, Fairfield and Vallejo to El Cerrito del Norte BART Station in El Cerrito and the Walnut Creek BART Station in Walnut Creek on separate routes. Passengers transfer to the BART train or onto an AC Transit bus (From Richmond via El Cerrito) to San Francisco. Solano Express is operated by Solanao County.\nVine Transit #29 goes up to the Napa (City) in the Napa Valley from El Cerrito del Norte BART Station.\n\n\n=== By boat ===\n\nIn many ways a boat is the ideal way to approach San Francisco. The city's spectacular skyline is best appreciated from the water, and from the deck of a boat the bay and its bridges and islands can be viewed as a whole. Cruise ships and private yachts are regular visitors to San Francisco, and passenger ferries regularly link other Bay Area cities to San Francisco.\nFerries run to San Francisco from Larkspur, Sausalito and Tiburon in Marin County, from Vallejo in Solano County and from Richmond, Alameda and Oakland in the East Bay. In San Francisco, the ferries dock at one or both of the city's two ferry terminals at Fisherman's Wharf and the Ferry Building, the later of which is a very short walk from the Amtrak San Francisco bus stop as well as Embarcadero Station, where the BART and Muni trains stop, and the stop for the historic streetcars that run above ground down Market Street. For more information on boat connections:\n\nGolden Gate Ferries, +1-415-455-2000. Serving Larkspur and Sausalito.\nBlue and Gold Fleet, +1-415-705-8200. Serving Alameda, Angel Island, Oakland, Sausalito, and Tiburon.\nSan Francisco Bay Ferry, +1-877-705-8291. Serving Alameda, Harbor Bay (in Alameda), Oakland, Richmond, and Vallejo.\n\n\n=== By car ===\nThere are four major highway approaches to San Francisco. US 101 comes up the eastern side of the SF peninsula and is the most direct route from the south, although it often backs up with traffic, and provides access to cities such as Los Angeles. Interstate 280 is a more scenic route into the city from the same direction, but with poorer connections than 101.  Interstate 80 approaches the city from the east over the San Francisco Bay Bridge, and is useful for access from places such as Oakland.  From the north, US 101 takes you over the Golden Gate Bridge.\nTraffic is heavy and parking is limited and expensive, so you will likely be better off parking outside the city at a BART, Caltrain, or ferry station.  Walking or MUNI can get you around once inside San Francisco.\n\n\n== Get around ==\nSee also: Bay Area public transit\n\n\n=== Navigating ===\n\nCross streets.  San Francisco streets are numbered (100 per block) from the beginning of the street, and even and odd numbers are always on opposite sides.  In the absence of GPS navigation, it is best when getting an address to also ask for a cross street or neighborhood name.  Most of the time, if a street touches Market Street (San Francisco's main street), that's the zero block.  Addresses change by 100 each block, so a building at 1275 Foo street is often 12 to 13 blocks away from where Foo St. hits Market St.\nNumbered streets and avenues. San Francisco has both numbered streets, in the Mission, the Castro, and SoMa, and numbered avenues in the largely residential Sunset and Richmond districts. Mixing numbered streets and avenues when asking directions may leave you miles from your destination. This can be confusing, as San Franciscans will not say \"Street\" or \"Avenue\" unless it is required to avoid ambiguity. Thus, they won't say \"I live on Fifth Avenue,\" but will say \"I live near Fifth and Geary.\" Street signs generally don't have \"Street\" or \"Avenue\" either; they just say \"GEARY\" or \"MASONIC\", although numbered streets and avenues do.\nMultiple street grids.  One of the most confusing aspects of driving in San Francisco is the presence of multiple street grids, particularly in the downtown area where two grids intersect at an angle along Market Street.  Even more confusing are streets in the middle of the standard blocks, like New Montgomery Street.\nNo left turns.  Several key San Francisco arterial streets, including 19th Avenue and Market Street, do not have space for dedicated left turn lanes and therefore bear No left turn signs at most intersections.  As a result, you will be frustrated when you drive for miles on these streets with no opportunity to turn left.  The trick, of course, is to go around the block with multiple right turns after passing one's desired street, which requires you to stay in the right lane, not the left lane.\n\n\n=== On foot ===\nWalking can be an enticing option to get from one neighborhood to another, as the city is compact and most of the tourist sites are in its northeastern portion. San Francisco is a city of friendly neighborhoods, but it is also a big city so be aware of your surroundings and keep in mind the dangers that commonly accompany a city of San Francisco's size.\nHowever, streets that often go straight up and down hills may make walking challenging when attempting the uphill portions (but provide good exercise). Driving can be difficult up and down hills but have breathtaking views. There are many stairway walks scattered throughout the city when the streets are too steep. You can find maps that include hiking trails, bikeways, and the grade pitch of all streets marked in varying colors by how steep each segment is, that can help you orient to city walks suitable to your ability and temperament, such as the downloadable map issued by the San Francisco Bicycle Coalition.\nLocals rarely use the designations \"street\" or \"avenue,\" even when differentiating the numbered streets and avenues. Numbered roads designated \"Street\" are on the east side of the city, south of Market in Downtown, Castro, Noe Valley, and Mission. Numbered roads designated \"Avenue\" put you in the Richmond and Sunset districts on the west side.\n\n\n=== By public transit ===\n\nSan Francisco has one of the most comprehensive public transportation systems in the United States, and is expanding its network with a regional transportation hub in SoMa and a new subway line going under downtown. Transport services within San Francisco are provided by several agencies, but transferring between them is easy now with a Clipper Card. Clipper is accepted on essentially every transit system you'll encounter:\n\nMuni \u2014 Metro, streetcars, buses, and cable cars within San Francisco proper. This is the main public transit system you'll use for getting around in San Francisco.\nBART \u2014 Subway train services in the San Francisco Bay Area. You'll mainly use this to get in and out of San Francisco, but you may use it, for example, to get between Downtown and the Mission. It overlaps with Muni along Market Street in Downtown. When you enter one of the stations on Market Street, be sure you get on the right system\u2014either Muni or BART\u2014for where you're trying to go. If not, you'll need to exit and beg the toll operators in the booths to refund your fare. Note that while BART fares are distance based, it charges an \"Excursion Fare\" if you enter and leave the system at the same station, so don't assume if you enter BART by mistake you can just tap your card on the exit gate and not be charged because you didn't go anywhere.\nCaltrain \u2014 Commuter rail services to San Jose and cities in between, like Palo Alto (where Stanford University is).\nFerry services \u2014 Golden Gate Ferries to the North Bay and San Francisco Bay Ferry to the East Bay (Blue & Gold Fleet ferries do not accept Clipper Card).\nMany other regional bus systems in the Bay Area  \u2014 Golden Gate Transit/Marin Transit (Marin County) and samTrans (Peninsula), among others.\nThe MUNI, Caltrain, and BART all have zero-tolerance for public urination, as it is a violation of the law. Violators of this law with not just be fined, they will also face jail time. There is also absolutely no smoking or vaping in any facility or vehicles. Passengers who violate this policy will be issued citations and may be arrested.\nInformation on all the Bay Area's transit agencies can be found by dialing 511 while in the Bay Area or by visiting the 511 website, which has a useful trip planner.\n\n\n==== Public transit payment ====\nThe basic cash Muni fare is $3.00 cash ($2.75 with Clipper or MuniMobile) for adults and $1.50 ($1.35 Clipper/MuniMobile) for seniors 65 and older and the disabled. When paying cash, get a transfer from the driver; it's good for 2 hours and shows that you paid. The Muni is free for people 18 and under.\nA \"day pass\" for $5.50 can be bought on any Muni vehicle for cash. Tell the driver before inserting the cash, so they will know you are not just paying the basic fare.  The driver will issue you a paper day pass, which pays for free rides for the rest of the day on buses, trains and streetcars.  This saves money when doing a round-trip that you won't complete in two hours, with subsequent rides free.\n\nThe Clipper Card is a contact-less, multi-agency fare card similar to Octopus in Hong Kong, EZ-Link in Singapore and Charlie Card in Boston. Clipper Cards can be added to most newer phones (2020 and onwards), purchased online, at any Muni or BART ticket machine as well as at select retail locations around the city, especially Walgreens.\nNew cards incur a one time $3 fee. The cards have no expiration date and can always be reloaded with cash or passes. When you depart, you can retain yours for future visits, if you don't mind all of your visits being tracked and linked. Or you can discard it when you leave, preferably where someone else will use it to save themselves the fee. Clipper can either be loaded with cash for pay-as-you-go with all transfers calculated automatically, a passport (daily and weekly passes) or a monthly pass.\nIf you are older than 65 years, you can easily get a Clipper Youth or Senior discount card.  Show proof of your age at a Clipper Customer Service location such as in the Embarcadero Muni/BART station.  Then load cash or passes onto your card.  This offers you half-price fares throughout Muni.\nMuni has also created a single-use \"Clipper Ticket\" as the new subway turnstiles no longer accept cash. You can still pay with exact change when boarding a streetcar above ground or a bus.\nMuniMobile is a mobile app that can be used for purchasing and activating Muni tickets, but they require finding a ticket attendant to validate your ticket to go into the Muni Metro.\nIf you plan on using the cable cars during your visit, a Muni passport is a great value.[1] A one-day passport (either as a scratch card sold at retail locations or loaded onto a Clipper Card) costs $22 (only $13 with Clipper or MuniMobile app) and includes Cable Cars (normally $8 a ride) as well as all other Muni rail and bus services. Three and seven-day paper passports are also available at $31 and $41, respectively. Passports are not valid on BART, ferries, Caltrain, or any regional municipal bus outside San Francisco \u2014 you'll want to load cash onto your Clipper Card if you plan on using any of these services. A \"day\" is a calendar day, not a 24-hour period.\nMuni operates on a proof of payment basis, sometimes called an \"honor system with teeth.\" Each fare paid is valid for two hours of travel on the Muni system (light rail, streetcar, or bus but not Cable Cars) including transfers and even return trips, as long as all travel is completed within the two-hour limit. If you're using a Clipper Card, be sure you \"tag on\" at any of the readers near the streetcar or bus door to pay your fare and start the two-hour clock.  People using Clipper, a transfer or a passport can board at any door. Otherwise, board at the front door, pay cash, and keep the paper transfer ticket that the driver gives you as proof of payment.  Muni fare inspectors and sometimes the police randomly patrol streetcars, subway stations and buses with handheld Clipper Card readers checking for proper fare.  Residents who ride Muni regularly report being checked once or twice a week on some lines, infrequently or never on others. The fine for being caught without proof of payment is $200, although tourists may be issued a warning if it's their first offense. The onus is on you to keep track of the time. If you are using a Clipper card and are unsure if your time has run out, just tag the card on any reader to check. If you have time left, you will not be charged again.\nCable Cars are not included in these transfers and cost $8 per ride (one way, no transfers), or $20 per day. Before 7AM and after 9PM, seniors and disabled pay $3 for cable car rides. Muni Passports and FastPasses greatly reduce this cost, including cable cars in the regular daily, weekly or monthly fares.\n\n\n==== Planning your public transit trip ====\nSince there are multiple overlapping transit systems, the best way to plan your trip is to use an online service which integrates information from the various transit agencies (e.g., 511 or a third party service like Google/Apple Maps).\nMuni arrival times for many lines are available at the bus/train stop (look for an overhead LED display at bus stops) or online at NextMuni. The sites listed above integrate information from NextMuni. An unofficial site is RescueMuni.com, which often has information on routes that are not listed officially.\nA portable wallet-sized map of San Francisco and all its public transit (Muni, BART, Caltrain) is also available at stores around the city, at the Powell & Market cable car ticket booth, or through their website online. Many of the city's bus stops also have posted copies of this map with the location of the stop marked, a godsend for lost pedestrians.\n\n\n==== Muni ====\nAgain, this is the main system you'll use when you're in the city. Muni consists of several types of trains and buses:\n\nMuni Metro (Lines  J ,  K ,  L ,  M ,  N , and  T ) is a modern light rail and subway system. It connects many southern and western neighborhoods to downtown, with connections to BART and Caltrain. Outside of the Market Street/Twin Peaks subway tunnel, Muni Metro operates as a surface light rail system, running in the center of the street with stops every couple of blocks.  (Many of these stops are not wheelchair accessible - check the map to see which ones are.) Tickets can be purchased from ticket vending machines before boarding; if the stop does not have such a machine and you do not have a ticket, you must board through the front door and buy one from the driver or risk being fined by a fare inspector. Muni Metro operates seven days a week from 4:30AM to 1:30AM. Between 1:30AM and 5AM, OWL Buses substitute for Metro service.\nThe  E  Embarcadero and  F  Market & Wharves Lines use historic streetcars, in original colors from several cities in the US and Milan, Italy. The  F  runs from Fisherman's Wharf south along the waterfront Embarcadero to the ferry building at the foot of Market Street, then up Market Street on the surface to the Castro district. The  E  runs the length of Embarcadero from Fisherman's Wharf to the 4th & King Caltrain station. Board through the front door and buy tickets from the operator if you do not already have a transfer or pass.\n\nThe world-famous Cable Cars run on three lines in the steep streets between Market Street and Fisherman's Wharf: the north-south Powell-Mason and Powell-Hyde lines and the east-west California Street line. They cost $8 for a one-way ticket, so purchasing a Muni 1-Day passport for $13 is a good financial decision if you plan to take two or more rides in a day. These cars are a fun ride, especially if you get to stand on the running board, if a bit impractical for everyday use (though residents of Nob and Russian Hills do, in fact, use them on a regular basis). The cable car is such an attraction that, especially on weekends, it takes longer to wait in line to ride up Powell Street than it does to walk the short but sloping distance.  If you want to save yourself time standing in line at the turnaround, just walk up a couple of blocks to the next stop \u2014 the conductors save a few spaces for people boarding along the way; you won't get first choice of seats, but you'll save yourself a long time standing in line.  Another option is to ride the California Street line - it's less iconic than the other lines but if you just want to ride a cable car and don't care about the postcard views it's usually much less busy. Board through any door or just grab a pole on the running boards; tickets are checked and sold by a uniformed conductor. Do not buy tickets from anyone off the car except for clearly marked ticket booths \u2014 scam artists are common. If buying a ticket on board, try to bring exact change, as conductors do not always have it.\nDiesel and electric trolley buses serve the rest of the city. You can board through any door if you have a Clipper Card (just touch the card to the card reader) or proof of payment (a Muni passport or a transfer). If you don't, board through the front door and buy tickets from the driver. Buses are scheduled every 2 minutes on a few lines in rush hour, 8 to 12 minutes on most lines during the day, and 15 to 20 minutes at night or between outlying neighborhoods. From your phone, use NextMuni or dial 511 to learn when the next 3 actual buses are likely to reach a particular stop.  Breakdowns or \"bunching\", leading to waits of 30 minutes or more, are possible.  Sometimes a parallel bus line just a few blocks' walk away will be arriving sooner. Main service runs between 6AM and midnight.\nOwl services run every 30 minutes overnight on key routes. Some of these are shortened versions of daytime routes. Two, the 90 and 91, combine daytime routes into longer nighttime journeys.\nRapid bus routes\u2014 with an \"R\" after the route number\u2014operate along some busy corridors that lack rail lines (Fulton, Geary, and Mission, for instance). These only stop at major intersections rather than every couple of blocks.  Tourists who aren't sure exactly where they're going should consider avoiding the Rapids, so they don't end up 10 blocks beyond where they want to be.\nExpress buses\u2014with route numbers containing \"AX\", \"BX\", or \"X\"\u2013are mostly rush-hours, peak-direction services for commuters. While of limited use to visitors, they could come in handy if your visit includes places in the western or southern areas of the city.\n\n\n==== Other public transit options ====\nThese are mainly used for getting in and out of the city:\n\nBART, the regional metro, has eight stations in San Francisco, making it a nice way to get between well-trafficked parts of the city, especially downtown and the Mission. BART gets you across the Bay to Berkeley and Oakland and to the airports of San Francisco and Oakland. BART Trains run over 107 miles (172 km) of track, serving 46 stations. BART trains operate on third rail power and accelerate to speeds approaching 70 mph (110 km/h). BART operates from 4AM to midnight M-F, 6AM to midnight Sat, and 8AM to midnight Sun. On weekdays, BART trains depart downtown San Francisco stations at three to four minute intervals. Outer stations in far outlying suburbs have a maximum wait of fifteen to twenty minutes between trains. After 12:30AM, AC Transit and other east bay transit providers provide late-night bus service, serving principal BART stations until about 6AM. BART routes are named for the two terminus stations, not by line color as denoted on the system map. For more information on BART, see the 'Get in' section above.\nCaltrain has three stops within San Francisco. Other than the 4th and King terminal in SoMa, these are the 22nd St. Station and the Bayshore Station (off Tunnel Ave), neither of which are particularly attractive for visitors. Of interest to visitors who wish to travel outside of the city is the Palo Alto Station (at University Avenue), across the street from the campus of Stanford University, and San Jose Diridon Station. Caltrain operates fast frequent commuter rail service, seven days a week. Service generally runs from 5AM to midnight. For more information on Caltrain, see the 'Get in' section above.\n\n\n=== By bike ===\nIf you have strong legs and can tolerate traffic with intermittent bike lanes, bicycles can be a convenient form of transportation in San Francisco. Although it's dense, San Francisco is fairly small in land area\u2014just 7x7 miles from north to south and east to west\u2014so it's fairly quick to get from one end to the other. But much of the terrain is hilly and hard to pedal up. Do not be misled by maps depicting the city's strict, regular street grid, as even the straightest of San Francisco's streets might include steep hills or even staircases instead of a roadway. San Franciscans who bike frequently find ways to \"wiggle\" \u2014 taking winding routes to avoid hills \u2014 around the steepest hills in the city. You might try using this flat route finder. You can also put your bike on the front of the Muni buses if you get desperate. Some maps compress the horizontal scale of the western half of the city.\nA classic and relatively easy ride is from the tip of Golden Gate Park's panhandle in the Haight, along paths and JFK Drive through the park to Ocean Beach. JFK Drive is lightly trafficked, and closed to cars on Sundays.\nDowntown, SoMa, and the Sunset, and Richmond districts are relatively flat. There are a number of bike paths and bike routes on city streets; the San Francisco Bike Coalition keeps a lot of information about them. There are a number of bike rental companies in town, including Wheel Fun Rentals, Dylan's Bike Rental, Bay City Bike and Blazing Saddles Bike Rentals with locations in Fisherman's Wharf, and the Bike Hut in SoMa. San Francisco Bicycle Rentals, with shops at Haight, Fisherman's Wharf and Ferry Building, charges $5 extra to drop off a bike at a different shop.\nThe Golden Gate Bridge has sectioned off pathways on each side for pedestrians and bicyclists. If you choose to ride a bicycle across the Golden Gate Bridge, be aware that walkers always stay on the east side of the bridge and bikes are often to ride on the west (ocean) side of the bridge. When the bridge is closed to pedestrians during nighttime, you may continue to bicycle across by stopping to press the buzzer at the automatically closed gates to be buzzed in and out. It is a pet peeve of many locals to have to dodge bicycles while jogging or strolling.\n\n Bay Wheels. A new bikesharing program that has stations throughout the Downtown area, particularly the Financial District, around the Civic Center, and in SoMa, with a few in North Beach and along the Embarcadero. A pass entitles you to unlimited rides under 30 minutes. Use Lyft or their own app to unlock bikes and pay for your rides. $9/24 hours; $22/3 days.   \nWatch out for the numerous streetcar and cable car tracks in the street. You don't want to get your bike's wheels caught in the groove next to the rail, or the slot for the cable car's grip. Like anywhere, when crossing train tracks, you should approach them from as close to perpendicular as you can.\n\n\n=== By taxi ===\nFor a large city, San Francisco taxis are surprisingly inefficient and expensive, starting at $3.10 just for getting in the door. You can get an idea of how much particular taxi trips cost in San Francisco using the SFMTA's webpage.\nExcept for near downtown business hotels, tourist destinations, and nightlife areas, taxis can be hard to find and hail\u2014and calling for a taxi can mean a 30-45 minute wait, if the driver shows up at all.\nIf you are heading to the airport, call ahead with a specific pickup time to one of the many taxi companies. Schedule your taxi ahead of time because if you are going beyond 15 miles, you will end up paying 50% extra.\nThe YoTaxi app, operated by Yellow Cab, and Flywheel's app are ways to hail a taxi with your phone. \nThere has been considerable controversy in San Francisco about increasing the number of taxis, but the situation is improving.\n\n\n=== By Uber or Lyft ===\nLyft and Uber are the two major players in San Francisco that provide a ride-hailing platform for taxi-like services. Uber is vastly larger, and Lyft is originally known for a whimsical, homespun feel. These two companies are very price-competitive, with prices often differing by only a few cents, although it's sometimes useful to compare prices for some rides, like going to the airport, which may differ by several dollars.\nBefore your visit, download and install the Uber and Lyft applications to your smartphone, and set them up with your credit card information. When you need a ride anywhere in the city, launch either app and arrange a ride. There is always a very good number of ride-hailing drivers available at all times, so you typically can get a ride within 10 minutes or less.\nYou can share the ride with strangers (\"Lyft Line\" or \"Uber Pool\") for a reduced price and longer ride times, or you can keep the ride private if you want to arrive to your destination as quickly as possible. Both apps have different options for the kind of ride you can hail.\nLyft and Uber drivers are not employed by either company, although there is a screening process. The drivers are everyday people who use the app to sell rides in their own vehicles, so treat them respectfully as you would a friend giving you a ride. If you have any concerns or complaints about your ride, contact Lyft or Uber and they will typically respond in a timely manner. Lyft and Uber's prices vary and may change due to surge pricing.\n\n\n=== By Waymo ===\nWaymo is a self-driving car company that operates in San Francisco with modified Jaguar I-PACE cars. As of September 2024, Waymo only operates within San Francisco itself and the suburbs of Daly City, Broadmoor, and Colma, meaning you can't ride the airport or to other parts of the Bay Area.\nBefore your visit, download Waymo One to your smartphone and add your credit card. When you need a ride, open the map and set your pickup and drop-off points. The wait times for Waymo rides are typically longer than for Uber and Lyft, since Waymo's fleet is smaller.\nIn a Waymo car, you're allowed to sit in any seat except the driver's seat. The front passenger seat is the most spacious and you can recline the seat. You can connect your phone to the cars to play music of your choice. You can also use knobs to adjust the temperature inside the car and use the in-car screens to see the car's LiDAR scans.\nYou can also add stops to your ride, but you'll be dropped off and a different car will come when you're ready to be picked up again. So, remember to take all of your items before exiting. If your stop lasts longer than half an hour, your next ride will be cancelled and you'll be charged for the ride to your first destination. You'll then need to book another ride.\nThe price of the rides vary and are subject to surge pricing, like Uber and Lyft. \n\n\n=== By car ===\n\nPerpetually-clogged traffic, steep hills, a confusing system of one-way streets downtown, expensive parking, and a fleet of parking control officers who zealously enforce parking laws can make driving in San Francisco extremely frustrating. Visitors to the city should seriously consider alternatives to driving when possible. A car is only useful for visiting destinations outside of the city, and even then you may be better off using public transit (especially crossing the Golden Gate Bridge into Marin County), a taxi, or another car sharing service.\nCar rental is expensive, registration fees are the highest in any U.S. state, and because collisions are common, rates for liability insurance (legally required) are high as well. In addition, traffic from the Golden Gate Bridge uses surface streets either along CA-1, 19th Avenue or US-101 on Lombard and Van Ness.\nThe most difficult problem with a car in San Francisco is parking. It is scarce  throughout the city. Garages, where they are available, are expensive ($20\u201330/day downtown). The city has a variable-pricing scheme which makes parking on the most popular streets even more expensive. San Francisco has some of the strictest parking laws and enforcement in the country.\nFor day trips into the city, consider a park-and-ride at a Peninsula Caltrain or BART station, at an East Bay BART station, or at a North Bay ferry terminal.\nWhen parking on a hill (there are many in San Francisco), always apply the parking brake and turn your wheels (\"curb your wheels\") so that the car will roll into the sidewalk instead of the street if the brakes give out. For example, when the car is facing uphill, turn the wheels toward the street; when facing downhill, turn the wheels toward the curb. Failure to park properly risks having your car roll downhill, and it is against the law; you will be ticketed for failing to curb your wheels.\nWhen parking on any street, pay extremely close attention to all street signs, e.g., no parking during rush hour times (typically 7-9 am and 4-7 pm), street cleaning every two weeks or every morning, loading-only zones, etc. The SFMTA enforces these street signs very religiously. You will get a parking ticket (or worst, your car will get towed and ticketed) for even the smallest infractions. Also pay attention to any red curbs, which indicate no parking.\nIf your vehicle gets towed, you must pay the city pound to retrieve it ($300 or more), plus the fine on the parking ticket. The typical parking ticket usually costs at least $70.\nVehicle break-ins are common occurrences in San Francisco. At best, a car window could get smashed and some valuables stolen, and at worst, the car could get stolen (although this is more of a problem for older cars). When leaving your car on the street overnight, take everything with you; never leave anything visible in the car.\nMotorcycles and scooters are common in San Francisco, for good reason. The city is one of the most motorcycle-friendly places in the U.S. Street parking for motorcycles is plentiful and very cheap ($0.30 to $0.80 an hour). There are several motorcycle rental shops, along with many dealers, service shops, and motorcyclist hangouts.\nAs elsewhere in California, motorcyclists and passengers are required to wear helmets. When parking on the street, it is legal to park in between cars, as long as the parking meter is paid for. Parking on sidewalks is illegal.\n\"Lane splitting\" (riding in between two lanes) on a motorcycle with two wheels is legal in California, but there are specific rules. Look up these rules on the California Highway Patrol website.\nMotorcycle theft is a problem; always use a disk lock or secure your bike to a stationary object using a cable or chain.\nSegways are somewhat popular among tourists. If you want to blend in, avoid them. So far there is only one authorized Segway dealer that rents out Segways, though various tour operators (many of whom operate from Fisherman's Wharf) offer guided trips throughout the city.\n\n\n== See ==\nSan Francisco has much to see \u2014 these are just the most significant sights. For more detail see the individual district sections, often linked from this entry.\nTwo passes are available which offer discounts to many interesting attractions:\n\n San Francisco CityPASS. A relatively cheap and easy way to cover many attractions of the city is the CityPASS. For a cost of $84 for adults and $64 for children 5-11, you get admission to the California Academy of Sciences, a Blue and Gold Fleet bay cruise, and two of the following: the Aquarium of the Bay, the Exploratorium, the San Francisco Zoo, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art or the Walt Disney Family Museum. A CityPASS works for nine consecutive days starting with the use of your first ticket (each ticket only accounts for one visit to each attraction). \n Go San Francisco Card. Another easy way to cover many attractions and tours is the Go San Francisco Card. This card covers admission to numerous attractions and activities, including sightseeing tours, bay cruises, an Alcatraz tour, and numerous museums. Various pass options are available, such as an all-inclusive pass that covers admission to all participating attractions but is only available in 1, 2, 3, 5 or 7-day periods, to \"Explorer\" and \"Family Fun\" passes that cover admission to only 4 or 5 attractions but are good for a full 30 days. Cost of passes vary; see website. \n\n\n=== Itineraries ===\nThere are many highlight walks you can take to really capture the feel of the city and see a whole lot of attractions at the same time. Some of the best ones are:\n\nThe Marina and the Presidio. Starting at Fort Mason on the eastern end of the Marina District, a stroll along the marina and the adjacent green will offer you excellent views of the Bay and the Golden Gate Bridge. At the other end of the Marina District, you can cross Marina Boulevard into the neighborhood to see the spectacular Palace of the Fine Arts and continue further inland into the heart of the Presidio, or you can proceed along the shoreline through Crissy Field to the Golden Gate Bridge.\nCow Hollow. Union Street between Gough and Fillmore is one of the city's finest shopping streets outside of the city center.\nPacific Heights. Fillmore Street between Pine and Broadway is lined with a good mix of shopping, views, steep slopes, and some of the city's largest and most expensive homes. Continue west along Broadway to Lyon Street and you'll be at the top of the Lyon Street Steps, a long staircase with superb views over the Bay and the Palace of the Fine Arts that's popular with local joggers.\nRussian Hill. Cozy and welcoming Russian Hill offers plenty of tucked-away stairways and hidden treasures for those who wander away from the cable cars rumbling along Hyde Street or the well-trafficked crooked section of Lombard Street. Stroll down the steps of Vallejo or Francisco Street, wander through the shady alleys past charming gardens and Victorian houses, and test your stamina on some of the city's steepest streets.\nNob Hill. California Street between Mason and Leavenworth sits atop lavish Nob Hill, where cable cars ply the center of the street past the grand hotels and luxury apartment buildings surrounding the Gothic-style Grace Cathedral.\nTelegraph Hill. Numerous tucked-away staircases, most notably the Greenwich and Filbert Steps on the east side of Telegraph Hill, offer a strenuous and unforgettably beautiful walk up to Coit Tower, past cottages, tranquil gardens, and wonderful views of the Bay, the skyline, and the surrounding hills. You might even be lucky enough to encounter Telegraph Hill's resident flock of wild parrots on the way.\nNorth Beach. Busy Columbus Avenue cuts diagonally across the street grid from Fisherman's Wharf to the landmark Transamerica Pyramid skyscraper in the Financial District, passing through the heart of North Beach with its grand churches and famous caf\u00e9s once populated with Beat poets.\nChinatown. Grant Street between Bush and Broadway takes you through the bustling heart of the famous district. Returning by the parallel Stockton or Powell will give you a better feeling of the day-to-day life of the residents, and are both good for those looking for imported commodities such as tea or herbs.\nFillmore. Post Street from Laguna to Fillmore takes you past the upscale shopping and restaurants of Japantown. Turning left onto Fillmore Street, continuing across Geary and ending at Turk, takes you past internationally known jazz venues and a mix of Black and Korean-owned shops.\nHaight Ashbury. Haight Street from Divisadero to Stanyan covers the shopping district made famous in the 1960s for its hippie culture; at Stanyan the street becomes a path through Golden Gate Park to a popular site (then and now) for relaxing and concerts. For a quieter walk, stroll south on Ashbury from Haight, past Victorians that were once the home to 1960s celebrities, then turn left on Frederick for a steep climb through Buena Vista Park, past stately oaks and splendid views of the skyline.\nOcean Beach. Ocean Beach is entirely open to pedestrians in both the Richmond and Sunset districts from the Cliff House restaurant in the north to the zoo in the south. For a shorter walk, the windmills near Lincoln at the end of Golden Gate Park offer a good base for a stroll north.\nLands End. Starting from the Cliff House at the north end of Ocean Beach, you can take a spectacular walk along the coastline with views over steep cliffs, crashing waves, shipwrecks, as well as the ocean and the Golden Gate. At the other end of the trail is the upscale neighborhood of Sea Cliff, home to the scenic China Beach tucked into a sea cove. Along the way you can take short detours to the intriguing ruins of Sutro Baths or venture uphill to the Legion of Honor museum with its excellent European art collection.\nCastro and Noe Valley. Market Street from Church to Castro followed by a left down Castro to 19th takes you through the center of the city's famous gay mecca. Continuing up Castro Street over the hill from there takes you to 24th, the main drag of bohemian Noe Valley.\nMission. Mission Street between 15th and Cesar Chavez streets provides a look at a neighborhood famous for its Latino food and culture. Parallel to Mission and just a block to the west, Valencia Street is lined with many higher end boutiques and offbeat caf\u00e9s starting to characterize the neighborhood, and has little of the grit of Mission Street. 16th Street between Mission and Guerrero offers a diversity of cuisine and several hip bars.\nCrosstown Trail. A 17-mile (27-km) hike all the way across the city through beautiful hillside neighborhoods and lovely forested parks.\n\n\n=== Landmarks ===\n\nPerhaps the most recognizable landmark in San Francisco and one of the most famous bridges in the world, the Golden Gate Bridge, spanning the Golden Gate, has been called one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World and is the first thing you see of San Francisco if driving in from the north, as it is one of the major road routes into and out of the city. Overlooking the Golden Gate is the Presidio, a former military post with beautiful architecture and a very scenic park setting. Just outside the Presidio is the gorgeous Palace of Fine Arts, built for the 1915 Panama-Pacific Exposition and reminiscent of Roman and Greek architecture.\nWithin the center of the city, the famous cable cars run up and down the hills of San Francisco between Market Street and Fisherman's Wharf and offer quite a ride (see above under Get around for more info). Atop one of those hills, Telegraph Hill in North Beach, is Coit Tower, a gleaming white tower dedicated to the San Francisco firefighters. At 275 ft (84 m) high, the hill is a healthy hike from the nearby neighborhoods just below. Another prominent tower nearby is the Transamerica Pyramid, the tallest and most recognizable building in the San Francisco skyline, located among the skyscrapers and highrises of the Financial District. Perhaps the most famous view of that skyline is from Alamo Square Park in the Western Addition district, home to the famous Painted Ladies row of Victorian houses, with many other pretty Victorians encircling the lovely park.\nOver on Russian Hill is the famous stretch of Lombard Street between Hyde & Leavenworth, the (nearly) crookedest street in America. The city also has a twistier but less scenic stretch of street, Vermont Street on Potrero Hill. Other street oddities in San Francisco include 22nd Street between Vicksburg and Church in Noe Valley and Filbert Street between Leavenworth and Hyde on Russian Hill \u2014 At a 31.5% grade, these streets share the honor of the steepest streets in San Francisco.\n\n\n=== Neighborhoods ===\n\nSan Francisco is also well known for its collection of unique and intriguing neighborhoods. Most tourists start with Fisherman's Wharf; although many of the locals consider it a tourist trap, it is a great place to see amazing street entertainers, watch sea lions, visit museums, or take a cruise to the infamous Alcatraz Prison or the pleasant Angel Island. Working fishing boats still come into the small harbor here, and the district is home to several excellent seafood restaurants. The fresh breeze from the bay can provide a bracing setting.\nChinatown, centered around Grant Street from Bush to Columbus, is part tourist trap, part an exhibit of local life. Good eating places abound, and the side streets especially have stores one wouldn't find in a mall. Stockton Street is where most locals do their shopping for groceries; be sure to sample some of the dim sum and other specialties offered in the many bustling shops. However, many local Chinese prefer to eat and shop in the new Chinatowns located in other neighborhoods such as on Clement Street between 2nd and 12th Avenues in the Inner Richmond neighborhood, or even in those in other cities of the Bay Area. The Muni #1 (California) and #2 (Clement, does not run at night) buses get people from one Chinatown to the other.\nCloser to Downtown is the Civic Center, with its impressive Beaux Arts buildings including City Hall and the War Memorial Veterans Building, the celebrated Asian Art Museum, music and theater venues (including large concert halls and a renowned Symphony and Opera), and the main public library. Nearby, within the highrises of Downtown, Union Square is the heart of the city's main shopping and hotel district, while SoMa to the south is rapidly gentrifying, home to the city's main convention center and several new museums.\nTo the west of Downtown is Haight Ashbury, famous for being a center of the Hippie movement in the 60s and 70s. While tourism has softened the image of the neighborhood somewhat, the area still retains its distinct feel with small organic coffee shops and store after store selling marijuana-themed goods, tie dye tee shirts and hand bands. Nearby at the top of Market Street is the Castro, the center of San Francisco's Lesbian/Gay/Bi/Transgender (LGBT) community, with numerous theaters and small shops and restaurants. Next door is the Mission District, home to the Mission Dolores Church, one of the oldest structures in the city, and a fantastic collection of murals of all sorts on the walls of many nearby buildings, especially on alleys between Market and Valencia.\nTreasure Island, an artificial island half-way between San Francisco and Oakland connected to the Bay Bridge, has excellent views of the San Francisco and Oakland skylines and quirky structures from the international fairground-turned-navy base-turned-neighborhood. Accessible by Muni bus #25 from the Transbay Terminal in SoMa.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nWhen the morning is foggy, you may want to spend a few hours in one of the city's many world-class museums. Many museums offer free admission on certain days during the first week of every month. Golden Gate Park is home to the copper-clad M.H. de Young Memorial Museum, which houses an impressive collection of contemporary and indigenous art. The de Young Museum's former Asian collection is now permanently housed in the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco, located in the Civic Center. Across from the de Young Museum stands the California Academy of Sciences, which holds a huge array of science exhibits, including an aquarium and a natural history museum. Lincoln Park, across the Richmond district from Golden Gate Park, is the home of the California Palace of the Legion of Honor, which houses an incredible collection of European art and makes for a good companion visit to de Young Museum, given that admission to either includes same-day admission to the other.\nIn Nob Hill, the Cable Car Museum offers exhibits on the famous moving landmarks of San Francisco and the opportunity to view the machinery that powers the cable cars. Another fun transportation museum is the small but charming San Francisco Railway Museum, on the streetcar line in the Financial District. Nearby SoMa is home to a growing number of museums, most notably the extensive, and renowned San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, but also smaller specialized museums like the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, the Children's Creativity Museum, the Cartoon Art Museum, the Museum of the African Diaspora, the California Historical Society Museum, and the Contemporary Jewish Museum, which is temporarily closed to save money. Down near the Castro is the GLBT History Museum, while a hill overlooking the Castro holds the Randall Museum, a lovely little children's museum off the beaten path.\nAt the Hyde Street Pier in Fisherman's Wharf you can board several historical ships, including the 1886 Balclutha clipper ship, a walking-beam ferry, a steam tug, and a coastal schooner. At Pier 45 just to the east, the World War II submarine USS Pampanito and the World War II Liberty Ship SS Jeremiah O'Brien can be visited. Nearby is the Aquarium of the Bay on Pier 39 and the Wax Museum. Just down the Embarcadero from the Wharf is the Exploratorium at Pier 15, which will keep your kids busy for an entire day with their science and perception exhibits. And just outside the Wharf in the Marina district is Fort Mason, home to a few cultural museums.\n\n\n=== Parks and outdoors ===\n\nSan Francisco has numerous parks, ranging from the tiny to the huge. The most famous of them is Golden Gate Park in The Avenues, a massive (roughly 1/2 mile-by-four mile) urban oasis with windmills, bison, museums, a carousel and much more hidden among its charms. The park contains the antique palatial greenhouse of the Conservatory of Flowers, the modern and ethnic art focused de Young Museum, the large Japanese Tea Garden, the new California Academy of Sciences building designed by Renzo Piano and the Strybing Arboretum, a collection of plants from across the temperate world. Defining the extreme northwestern corner of the city is Lands End in Richmond, which provides majestic views of the Marin Headlands, the Golden Gate Bridge from the ocean side, and the Pacific Ocean itself. At the extreme western end the well known Cliff House provides both semi-casual and a more formal eating and drinking place overlooking the intriguing ruins of Sutro Baths.\nNear the physical center of the city is the Twin Peaks, one of San Francisco's highest points (875' above sea level); providing spectacular views in all directions. Tour buses can get backed up here during the day, but it's a great place to really appreciate the city from above, especially at and after sunset. Temperatures up there can be quite a bit lower than in the rest of the city, so bring a jacket. Nearby in the Lake Merced area is the San Francisco Zoo, a large and well maintained zoo which is a great place to go if you are traveling with children or have a fondness for penguins, primates, lions or llamas.\nWhile not particularly well known for its beaches, San Francisco has a couple of good ones along the Pacific Ocean \u2014 but the water is brisk, the winds can be rough, and due to strong rip currents swimming at any of them is not recommended. Ocean Beach along the Sunset district is the largest and most famous beach, with plenty of sand and people enjoying themselves. China Beach in Richmond and Baker Beach in Golden Gate are smaller, rather secluded beaches with lovely views.\nOff the coast of San Francisco is one of the most productive marine environments on Earth, which attracts abundant marine life including blue whales, gray whales, humpback whales, dolphins, seals and sea lions, leatherback sea turtles, and many species of seabirds. The rocky Farallon Islands, roughly 30 miles offshore from San Francisco, are part of a National Marine Sanctuary and provide nesting habitat for tens of thousands of seabirds. The islands are also known for attracting large numbers of great white sharks from September through November. It is possible to take boat tours to the Farallon Islands throughout most of the year and go whale watching, departing from Fisherman's Wharf or the Marina in San Francisco.\nOn sunny days hipsters flock to Mission Dolores Park, so named due to its location across the street from the Mission Dolores Basilica. The park often comes to resemble a large party, with music, coolers of beer and, er, uh...medical marijuana treatment. Mission Dolores Park is situated on a slight slope on the edge of the Mission neighborhood, just a few blocks from the district's many restaurants and bars. The east side of the park is bounded by Dolores Street, a hilly and scenic drive lined with palm trees and Victorians.\nIn the southern half of the city is the often overlooked but wonderful Bernal Heights Park, a small park on top of a hill overlooking the entire eastern half of the city, with excellent views of the skyscrapers in the Financial District, the Mission District, and the hills in the southeastern corner of the city. A wide trail runs around the base of the park below the peak which can be walked in ten to fifteen minutes. Bernal Heights Park is dog friendly, so much so that a coyote is often observed there.\n\n\n== Do ==\n\n\n=== Harbor tours ===\n\nOne of the best ways to see San Francisco is from the waters of San Francisco Bay. There are many companies offering harbor tours of varying durations and prices but they all provide marvelous views of the bay, the bridges, the island of Alcatraz and the city.\nOnly specific island tours are allowed to land at Alcatraz, but the typical harbor tour will circle the island at a slow crawl, giving you plenty of opportunity to photograph the now-inactive prison from the water.\nAlso consider taking a ferry from San Francisco across the bay to Tiburon, Sausalito, or Alameda. Same views for a fraction of the price.\nMost tours leave from docks at Fisherman's Wharf near Pier 39. Tickets can be purchased at kiosks along the waterfront walk. Buy tickets a day or two in advance during the summer high season.\nBoats usually leave roughly hourly starting around 10AM and ending around 5PM. Multi-lingual guides are available on some tours. Prices range from $20\u201340, more for sunset, dinner, or whale watching tours.\n\nEven on a sunny day the bay can be chilly, so be sure to bring a sweater as well as sun screen.\nSome boats have snack bars on board, but bring your own water and treats to avoid paying high costs or going without. There are now limited refreshments and a souvenirs shop on Alcatraz.\n\n\n=== Performing arts ===\n\nSan Francisco has a Half-Price Ticket Booth in the middle of Union Square, where tickets for most San Francisco theater performances can be purchased the day of the performance for half-price. Run by Theatre Bay Area, all service fees collected from the sale of tickets by TIX Bay Area goes right back into the theater community.\nGo to a concert, a play, a jazz or a folk-song performance. There are performances most days to choose from by the San Francisco Opera, the San Francisco Symphony, in Herbst Theater (where the United Nations charter was signed), in the Old First Church, and for musicals in the Orpheum or the Golden Gate Theaters, all located in or near the Civic Center. The museum of the Legion of Honor, located in Lincoln Park overlooking the Golden Gate (north end of 34th Ave), has organ concerts which can be heard in many of its galleries, Saturdays and Sundays at 4PM, as well as music performances in its Florence Gould Theater by the San Francisco Lyric Opera.  For the fall and spring jazz festivals look into the SFJAZZ calendar. San Francisco also has many jazz clubs, best found by browsing the web (an excellent site is SFStation.com). Contemporary bands are featured at The Fillmore Auditorium and less frequently at the large Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in the Civic Center.  The Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival is a large free annual concert weekend in Golden Gate Park. Many events are listed by the City Box Office.\nBallet of the world class variety can be seen for only $10. San Francisco Ballet sells standing room tickets (with excellent views from the back of the orchestra) for their shows at the War Memorial Opera House in Civic Center during the afternoon of each performance as well as two hours before showtime.\nPlays are performed at the Geary (by the American Conservatory Theater), Curran, and the Marines Memorial theatres near Union Square, and at the small New Conservatory Theater near the Civic Center.\nMusicals from Broadway and Los Angeles are shown at the traditional Golden Gate and Orpheum theaters on Market, near the Civic Center.\n\n\n=== Events ===\nThere is an incredible array of events going on in San Francisco \u2014 virtually every day there will be something of interest to anyone going on, and San Francisco's mild climate ensures that practically every weekend will bring another major festival or some sort of large event. Listed here are just some of the really big events going on:\n\n\n==== Cultural events ====\n Cherry Blossom Festival: .  Western Addition. April. In Japantown, this kid-friendly event includes a parade, a street fair, and music. (date needs fixing)\nBig Book Sale: Fort Mason. A gigantic book sale where dozens of private libraries are donated and put on display. Cheap prices and hidden gems make this feel like an adult scavenger hunt.\n San Francisco International Film Festival: .  Based at the Presidio in Golden Gate, but smaller events take place throughout the city. Two weeks in Apr/May. Organized by the San Francisco Film Society who are based in the Presidio, but the arthouse movies, documentaries, and short films are shown throughout the city. (date needs fixing)\n Union Street Art Festival: .  Golden Gate. First weekend in June. This festival attracts many local artists who line the streets displaying their arts and crafts, along with live jazz and classical music performances and an organic farmer's market. (date needs fixing)\n Haight Ashbury Street Fair: .  Haight. On the second Sunday of June, people pack the Upper Haight for this event featuring local bands, food stalls and plenty of shopping. (date needs fixing)\n Fringe Festival: .  Taking place at various theaters in the Civic Center-Tenderloin area. Just after Labor Day in September. A 10-day festival about theatrical experimentation and having fun, even if you don't know what you're doing exactly. (date needs fixing)\n Folsom Street Fair: .  Unsurprisingly, on Folsom in SoMa, last Sunday in September. Advertised as the world's largest leather/fetish event. Not really one for the kids. (date needs fixing)\n\n\n==== Holidays ====\n Chinese New Year Festivities, Chinatown. January or February. The San Francisco version of the Chinese New Year dates way back, with a colorful, vibrant parade with decorative costumes, lions, deafening firecrackers, \"lucky-money\" envelopes, colorful banners, ornately themed floats, martial arts groups, stilt walkers, acrobats, and, of course, a 200-foot Golden Dragon. \n Easter Parade and Spring Celebration, Union Street in Golden Gate. The kid-friendly but diverse festivities include a petting zoo, pony rides, live music, train rides, alfresco dining, and a parade. \n Fourth of July. San Francisco's main Independence Day celebrations take place on Fisherman's Wharf. There is lots of free entertainment during the day, culminating with an impressive fireworks display from the foot of Municipal Pier, and at the other end of the Wharf from barges moored off the north of Pier 39. \n Italian Heritage Parade, North Beach. This hugely popular parade celebrates Italian heritage. Handmade floats run all the way from Fisherman's Wharf up Columbus Avenue through North Beach. \n Tree Lighting Ceremony at Ghirardelli Square, Ghirardelli Square, Fishermans' Wharf. End of November. Ring in the holiday season by attending the festivities at Ghirardelli Square. There's theater, live music, and then at the end they decorate a 45-foot Christmas tree with ornaments, lights, and chocolate bars. \n\n\n==== LGBT community events ====\nSan Francisco is famous for its exuberant and visible lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community, who always put together some very festive events:\n\n Pink Saturday. A street party in the Castro on the Saturday night before the Pride Parade and Celebration. \n San Francisco Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender Pride Parade and Celebration. One of the largest gay pride parades and festivals in North America, centered in the Civic Center area. It's a huge, happy, chaotic celebration of diversity, politics, sexuality, and San Francisco wackiness, on the last weekend in June. About a dozen stages and spaces offer everything from square dancing to hip-hop, from a family garden to Leather Alley. It's a movement, it's a market, it's a party. The parade and celebration are for everyone\u2014straight and gay are welcome. \n Halloween in the Castro. Halloween, the holiday when everyone puts on a mask, has long been a special time for gay, lesbian and bisexual people to take off the \"straight-looking mask\" they sometimes wore all year, and be themselves. What remains today is a huge, sometimes poorly controlled, street party in the Castro on the evening of October 31 each year. Police efforts have attempted to tame this and it has been much diminished. \n\n\n==== Outdoor and recreational events ====\n Critical Mass. On the last Friday of each month, bicyclists in San Francisco (and about 200 like-minded cities world-wide) gather at the north end of Market Street on the Embarcadero and ride en masse to some destination, demonstrating their right to use the roads. If you are driving in SF on a Critical Mass day, you will want to listen for radio traffic reports, but if you are stopped by the mass the best thing to do is maintain a good sense of humor and remember that it will all pass in about 5 minutes. Tempers can and do flare, and there have been cases where run-ins with drivers and bicyclists have gotten violent. If your car is surrounded by bikes, definitely do not move until they have passed or they might feel threatened. \n Bay to Breakers. Third Sunday in May. An annual footrace that is one of the largest in the country. The route runs from Downtown to Ocean Beach. Many runners do the whole thing in costume, wearing anything from elaborate costumes to wearing almost nothing at all, lending a party atmosphere to the event. \n Escape from Alcatraz Triathlon. Second Sunday in June. Participants (which often include world champions and Olympic medalists) swim 1.5 miles through chilly waters, bike 18 miles, and then run an extra 8 miles. The course winds its way throughout the city, but the transition and finish line is at Marina Green in the Golden Gate area. (updated May 2024)\n Fleet Week, Fisherman's Wharf. Usually held in the first week of October, it's a tribute to the men and women in the armed forces. A flotilla of Navy ships dock on the Wharf in parade fashion, and there are many free Deck tours available from crew members. There are also several air displays by the Navy flyers. \n Sunday Streets. An approximately monthly event rotating through various neighborhoods where the local main street is closed to car traffic for a pedestrian street fair. \n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nThe Bay Area has several professional sports teams, although most of those teams play in nearby San Jose and Oakland rather than San Francisco itself. The National Football League's San Francisco 49ers moved from Candlestick Park (which has since been demolished) in San Francisco to Santa Clara in 2014.\nThe San Francisco Giants are the city's Major League Baseball team, playing their home games at the lovely Oracle Park (recently renamed from AT&T Park) in SoMa and commanding a large and devoted fan base. With the Niners' move to Santa Clara, the Giants were the only team in America's major sports leagues playing in the city itself for a few years, but they've now been joined by the NBA's Golden State Warriors, which moved from their longtime home in Oakland to the new Chase Center, located on the Mission Bay waterfront a few blocks south of Oracle Park, in 2019. The NBA's women's counterpart, the WNBA, will add the Golden State Valkyries for the 2025 season. The Valkyries are owned by the Warriors and will also play at Chase Center. (The WNBA season has minimal overlap with that of the NBA, mostly taking place in summer.) As far as college sports go in San Francisco, the only NCAA Division I program in the city itself is the San Francisco Dons, representing the University of San Francisco and playing various college sports including baseball, basketball, soccer and volleyball at their campus in Western Addition. The San Francisco State Gators, an NCAA Division II program, play various college sports including baseball, basketball and soccer at their campus near Lake Merced. However, if you're interested in college football, you'll have to leave the city to see it\u2014neither of the city's NCAA programs has a football team. The Bay Area's three Division I football teams are in Berkeley (California), the Peninsula near Palo Alto (Stanford), and in Silicon Valley (San Jose State).\n\n\n=== Local music ===\nSan Francisco is a hotbed for underground music; a highly diverse array of musical styles is represented (e.g., rock, pop, experimental, weird folk, and avant-jazz). Shows occur every night, with as many as fifteen small shows occurring each Thursday through Saturday night. Much of this activity is not always well covered in the mainstream media; useful community-driven resources for finding about local shows include the Bay Improviser Calendar (previously known as the Transbay Calendar).\n\n\n== Learn ==\nThere are three world-class research universities in the Bay Area: University of California, San Francisco with two large campuses in San Francisco focused on biomedical research and training; University of California, Berkeley in Berkeley; and Stanford University in Palo Alto. Many of the major businesses in the area have a connection to one of these universities.\nThe University of California, San Francisco is one of the city's largest employers and is dedicated solely to the education of health and the biomedical sciences. Unlike many other universities, it does not have undergraduate programs and only admits graduate students. Also in the University of California system, though governed separately from the rest of the system, is the UC College of the Law, San Francisco (historically the Hastings College of the Law), a major law school located in downtown San Francisco. The San Francisco State University is another major public university that offers a broader range of studies than the UC colleges in the city. Rounding off the city's public colleges is the City College of San Francisco, a two-year community college.\nSan Francisco also has numerous private colleges and universities, some of them large, such as the University of San Francisco located in the Richmond district, and Academy of Art University with properties throughout the city.\n\n\n== Work ==\nWhile San Francisco's economy is linked to it being a world-class tourist attraction, its economy is diversified. The largest employment sectors are professional services, government, finance, trade, and tourism. Its frequent portrayal in music, films, literature and popular culture has helped make the city and its landmarks known throughout the world. San Francisco has developed a large tourist infrastructure with numerous hotels, restaurants, and top-notch convention facilities.\nWhile it's been a long time since people considered Montgomery Street in the Financial District to be the \"Wall Street of the West\", San Francisco remains the undisputed financial capital of the West Coast, home to the headquarters of some of the world's major financial institutions such as Wells Fargo Bank as well as the regional headquarters of the United States Federal Reserve. Many major financial institutions and banks are based in the city or have set up regional headquarters here.\nSan Francisco's proximity to Silicon Valley has made the city increasingly attractive for high-tech companies. While most of the large technology companies are in the valley, many tech workers live in San Francisco and commute to work.  San Francisco has also been making itself a center of biotechnology.\n\n\n== Buy ==\nIndividual listings can be found in San Francisco's district articles\nSan Francisco is arguably the most expensive city in the U.S., and prices of many things, including groceries, restaurant meals and rent have even surpassed those of notoriously expensive New York City.\nIf you want it, chances are likely you can get it in San Francisco. There are a wide range of small and locally owned businesses throughout the city's neighborhoods, as well as big chains.\nIf it's tourist trinkets you're looking for, Fisherman's Wharf has the typical souvenir, T-shirt, and camera shops, along with plenty of specialty stores.  However, San Francisco's most popular shopping area is Union Square, which has all the big national department stores (Macy's, Saks, Nordstrom, etc.) and plenty of fancy boutique stores, as well as a few shopping centers thrown in.\nFor small, upscale boutiques, Union Street, Fillmore Street, and Chestnut Street in the Golden Gate area are lined with unique and trendy places, and all three streets are among the best spots in the city to window shop. Nob Hill is also full of specialty places.\nBut if you don't have a luxury dollar to spend and still want to walk away with something unique, there are plenty of shops in Chinatown for you, selling Oriental handicrafts of all descriptions, and no chain stores in sight. Japantown also offers plenty of great shops selling authentic souvenirs, including the excellent Kinokuniya Stationery/Bookstore. The Haight is full of excellent independent record and book stores, with Amoeba Music dominating the scene.\nFor basic supplies, try the ubiquitous 7-Eleven convenience stores and Walgreens pharmacies. If you need groceries, Safeway is the dominant supermarket chain in the city, though pop into a Trader Joes for better prices. There are Safeway stores in SoMa, near Fisherman's Wharf, and near the Financial District, but not near Union Square. The closest supermarket to Union Square is the upscale Bristol Farms supermarket at Westfield San Francisco Shopping Centre.\n\n\n== Eat ==\n\nIndividual listings can be found in San Francisco's district articles\nSan Francisco is a \"foodie\" city with a vast array of restaurants. In fact, San Francisco has more restaurants per capita than any major city in North America, with 1 restaurant for every 250 residents (in comparison, New York City has 1 restaurant for every 940 residents). The price range is huge, of course, and you can spend anywhere from a small fortune to a couple bucks for every type of cuisine. In addition to the range of ethnic restaurants you'd expect to find, Bay Area food culture focuses on \"artisanal\" food (see the Ferry Building) and fresh fruits and vegetables (see Alice Waters), drawing from the nearby farms in California.\nSan Francisco is known for specialties such as the Mission burrito and cioppino. The Mission burrito is considered to have been invented in the Mission District, and in fact there is a particular taqueria on Valencia Street that claims credit for the invention, although their burritos are just OK and a number of taquerias in the Mission serve much better examples of the style. Burritos are much larger than tacos and contain rice, making them even more filling.\nCioppino started as a fisherman's stew in North Beach and is a local variation on stews from the region of Liguria, from which many 19th-century San Franciscan fishermen hailed. It's a large tomato- and white wine-based soupy stew of fish and seafood with bread.\nIn San Francisco, you would be well-served by using an online restaurant rating website to find the best restaurants. Yelp.com, for example, is actively maintained by San Franciscans. All the best restaurants (and bars) are mobbed on the weekends, so you'll do well to check out the availability on opentable.com or similar websites.\nSan Francisco restaurants are also very corkage friendly. Average corkage fee appears to be in the $15 range, with some of the more pricey places charging $25\u201335.\nVegetarians and vegans will find SF a paradise; however, contrary to popular belief, the city has one of the lowest rates of vegetarian consumers in the nation.\n\n\n=== Ethnic food and neighborhoods ===\nYou can still find some ethnic food districts in San Francisco. Some of these, like North Beach, have become museums for tourists, while others, such as the (Inner) Mission and Chinatown, are still strongly ethnic neighborhoods which maintain their native food culture. In truth, the food culture in the city is oriented less around ethnic districts than restaurant areas. In the Mission, for example, you will find not just Mexican food but rather excellent options of many kinds (e.g., Sushi, Indian, Italian, Thai, etc.)\nWith the largest Chinatown in North America as well as one of the largest Chinese communities in the West, there are many exceptional restaurants serving dim sum and other Chinese delicacies found throughout the city. This localized Chinese cuisine has its feet in Hong Kong and America, and is different from what many visitors are accustomed to \u2014 it is common to hear complaints from Chinese or US Midwestern visitors that Chinese food here is not like the food back home. There are several main types of Chinese restaurants in San Francisco: those primarily serving immigrants from Hong Kong (\"Hong Kong style\") which commonly have signs on the wall in Chinese characters, live fish and shellfish tanks and some exotic main ingredients, such as pig's blood or sea cucumber; those primarily serving San Franciscans who are not Asian immigrants (\"California Chinese\") which commonly have Westernized table service, low fat content and more emphasis on fresh vegetables; those primarily serving tourists or other people accustomed to Chinese food as it is commonly served in the United States (\"Americanized Chinese\"); and those primarily serving immigrants from other areas or a particular dietary need or interest (regional cuisines, vegetarian, Muslim). There may be some mixing between these various classifications and each category may influence the others. For instance, the Americanized dish known as Chop Suey is often not served even at Americanized Chinese restaurants in San Francisco and your moo shu may come with flour tortillas in place of rice pancakes, while Chinese vegetables such as bok choy and pea sprouts may turn up on your plate at California Cuisine style restaurants.\nOther regional Chinese cuisines have made inroads, and if you can't find them in San Francisco, you can often find them elsewhere in the Bay Area.\nSan Francisco is also one of the best places in the nation for other Asian cuisine: Korean, Thai, Indian, and Japanese. Sushi is a local obsession. Japantown and the Richmond district have more than their fair share of excellent sushi chefs.\nInexplicably to many locals, Fisherman's Wharf remains a popular place for tourists to find fresh but overpriced seafood, especially clam chowder and crabs cooked to order.\nFor tourists, North Beach is the place to go for Italian food. The restaurants along Columbus, which cater to tourists, are overpriced. You can, of course, find great Italian and pizza all over the city.\nThe Mission and are great for Mexican, Salvadoran and Latin American cuisine of all sorts, as is much of Mission Street south though Bernal Heights, the Excelsior, and Crocker-Amazon.\n\n\n== Drink ==\nIndividual listings can be found in San Francisco's district articles\n\n\n=== Bars and clubs ===\nThe best way to find a good bar or club is to ask the advice of a local; but barring that a quick search on yelp/google will help you find something suited to your personal taste.\nThe great diversity of nightlife in San Francisco, sometimes within one neighborhood, reflects the diversity of cultures there. Here's a sampling:\n\nIf you want door-to-door bar hopping at friendly bars that serve PBR tall boys, definitely go to \"Polk Gulch\" in the Tenderloin and work your way north through bars such as Mayes and Hemlock.\nHead to the Marina for mid-20s to mid-30s professionals (and those visiting from Los Angeles) as well as a college atmosphere clubbing scene around super packed club/bars such as Circa.\nAre you into clubs? If you want to commit to a single venue for the night and club the night away, pay the necessary cover at high end clubs in South of Market (SoMa) such as The Grand and Manor West, where you can find left-over dot-commers and hipsters hanging out on the street.\nThe Castro primarily serves San Francisco's gay men, while Bernal Heights has some notable lesbian bars such as Wild Side West with a beautiful outdoor patio in back.\nThe Mission offers a more down to earth vibe that still lets you get your dance on; a bonus with this is that you can end the night with a great burrito from one of the local Mission taquerias.\nWith a large Irish population, San Francisco has a number of very good Irish pubs (e.g., Danny Coyle's in the Haight, Four Deuces in the Sunset, and many others). North Beach is home to several dance clubs and strip clubs.\nIf you like soccer (football) and all things English, you should stop into the Kezar Pub, at the edge of the Haight-Ashbury District, or Lower Haight's Mad Dog In the Fog. The pub quiz and bar food are good. Swill some pints and stay in the dark. Good for an entire day's worth of drinking.\n\n\n=== Beer ===\nSan Francisco, despite being much smaller than New York City, sports more microbreweries.  Anchor Brewing Company (makers of Anchor Steam) is brewed on Potrero Hill, though it is generally not open to the public (tours are available by reservation).  Similarly, Speakeasy Ales & Lagers opens its doors on Friday evenings and Saturday afternoons, though its location in Hunter's Point makes it a long Muni ride if you're traveling without a car.  The other microbreweries are housed in brewpubs:\n\nBeach Chalet & Park Chalet are at the Pacific end of Golden Gate Park, where you can enjoy a view of the ocean or sit in the lawn area.\nMagnolia Brewing Company is in the heart of the Haight.\n21st Amendment, also in SoMa, is three blocks away from the Giants' home at AT&T Park.\nSouthern Pacific Brewing Company is a large bar in the Mission District.\nCellarmaker Brewing Company is a highly regarded brewery in SoMa, with an emphasis on hop-driven beers.  The original SoMa location is closing at the end of 2022, but they also run Cellarmaker House of Pizza in the Mission/Bernal area, and will open an Oakland location in 2023.\nWoods Brewery has multiple locations around town.\nHop Oast in the Mission is a cozy neighborhood microbrewery.\nOther destinations for beer drinkers include the City Beer Store and Tasting Bar on Valencia St in the Mission (your best bet for beer to go), the Mission's Monk's Kettle, and the famous Toronado Pub on lower Haight Street, which specializes in Belgian ales.\nThe surrounding Alameda, San Mateo, and Marin Counties also host many microbreweries worth trying - in particular, Fieldwork, Alvarado Street, and Sante Adairius. Many of these are accessible by BART.  And although Santa Rosa is 45 minutes north of San Francisco, no beer lovers should skip the renowned Russian River Brewing Company in downtown Santa Rosa.\n\n\n== Sleep ==\nIndividual listings can be found in San Francisco's district articles\nSan Francisco offers a wide range of accommodations, from a healthy supply of hostels and budget hotels to the lavish, luxurious hotels in the city center, as well as just about everything in-between. The majority of accommodations are in the northeastern portion of the city, in and around the popular areas of Downtown, Chinatown, and Fisherman's Wharf. As one moves into the mostly residential neighborhoods to the west, the sleeping options filter down to small inns and bed and breakfasts.\nDecide if you want to be in walking distance of your destinations, or are up to driving and parking (which can be quite an undertaking in some of the busier areas of San Francisco) or taking public transit. If you have a specific destination in mind, look also in the Districts sections.\nHotel costs are particularly variable in San Francisco.  The price of a night's stay, especially in the SoMa neighborhood, depends significantly on what's happening at the Moscone Convention Center. Hotel rates can triple when the biggest events are underway.  If your trip dates are flexible, you can save a lot of money by avoiding busy dates (it amounts to about half the year).  In general, the biggest hotels are more expensive than smaller chains and local outfits.\nIf you'd rather stay closer to the San Francisco International Airport, there are plenty of standard airport accommodations in the cities surrounding the airport \u2014 Brisbane, Burlingame, Millbrae, San Bruno and South San Francisco. From there, you can drive or take BART or Caltrain into San Francisco.\n\n\n== Connect ==\nThe area codes for San Francisco are 415 and 628. You must dial 1+area code+number for all calls within the city (if you're using a mobile phone, the \"1\" is not necessary). For calls within the US or Canada, dial 1+area code+number (again, the \"1\" is not needed when using a mobile phone), and for international calls, dial 011+country code+city code(if applicable)+number. Pay phones are getting less and less commonplace as nearly everyone in San Francisco has a mobile phone.  They only take coins and phone cards with a dial-to-use number. Local calls start at $0.50.\nTo get online, free wifi is available on Market Street and a bunch of other locations; look for the network \"#SFWiFi\". Many coffee houses and cafes also offer wireless connection for free or a small fee, or try the Apple Store on Stockton at Ellis near Market in Union Square or any of the many public libraries, especially the main branch on Market near Civic Center station. Internet cafes are available at a sprinkling of city center locations.\nBlue mailboxes for mail such as letters and postcards are near USPS post offices, which sell stamps and ship packages. Several private mailing companies provide additional services.\n\n\n== Stay safe ==\nA look at Stanley Robert's People Behaving Badly series will give you an inside look of usually petty crime in the city. However, it is very unlikely you'll encounter any violent or petty crime as long as you use your common sense and are vigilant.\nThe areas that one should be most cautious are in the neighborhoods of Bayview-Hunters Point, Visitacion Valley, Sunnydale, Ingleside, and Potrero Hill in Southeast San Francisco, as well as the Tenderloin, parts of Western Addition (including the Fillmore District), and parts of the Mission. San Francisco is still susceptible to violent crime, and most of these murders occur in the southeast, less economically fortunate, neighborhoods of the city. Gang violence touches even busy and thriving areas such as the Mission Street retail corridor, although most instances of violent crime are directed to specific targets and are not random acts. The SoMa district used to be somewhat dangerous; however, gentrification (something that has become fairly common and a social issue in SF) has transformed it into a rather hip and much safer neighborhood with plenty of art galleries and clubs. However, it is best to be careful even now.\nDo not any leave anything visible in your vehicle, not even small inexpensive items like cellphone mounts, especially when parking on public streets.  Car break-ins are very common in San Francisco, and any visible items are an invitation for thieves to smash your windows and ransack your car. During your visit, you will probably see small piles of broken glass on sidewalks throughout the city, which are the result of such crimes. If you cannot carry all valuables with you, try to keep them in the trunk and park your vehicle in secure parking garages, which are slightly safer than street parking but are not completely free from crime either. Bicycle theft is extremely common so bikes should be securely locked to a sturdy surface, even if you're going to only be gone a minute.\nSan Francisco also has the largest homeless population per capita in the United States. If someone begs from you, you may either politely say you do not have any change or just keep walking, and he or she will generally leave you alone. The main homeless area is around 6th and Market, heading towards the Civic Center, and in the Tenderloin. Haight Ashbury also has lots of panhandlers, and the area near Golden Gate Park at the end of Haight Street near Stanyan is notorious for junkies and should be avoided at night.\nPickpocketing, purse snatching, and other forms of petty crime are common as with any other large city. Be especially cautious on crowded Muni trains and buses, in heavily touristed areas such as Fisherman's Wharf, and during the busy holiday shopping season.\nBe careful to check for ticks after hiking in fields in the Bay Area. There is a high rate of lyme disease transmission in the Bay Area. If a bulls' eye rash develops at the tick bite site, immediately seek medical help and treatment with antibiotics.\nRogue waves can occur at Ocean Beach along the Pacific edge of San Francisco.  It is not uncommon for unsuspecting tourists to be swept out to sea during high surf conditions.  A good rule of thumb is to avoid facing away from the ocean.  Strong currents are also a hazard for swimmers.\n\n\n== Cope ==\n\n\n=== Publications ===\nSan Francisco Chronicle. The main newspaper in San Francisco. $1.50 daily, $3.00 Sunday.\nSan Francisco Examiner. A free daily newspaper.\nSF Weekly. An online-only arts & culture website, formerly a free weekly distributed widely across the city.\nSan Francisco Bay View. Politics, economics, and news from a progressive African American perspective.\nAsianWeek. A weekly paper, one of the largest English language publications for Asian-Americans.\nBay Area Reporter. Free-weekly serving the LGBT community.\nSan Francisco Bay Times. Another free-weekly LGBT newspaper.\nSan Francisco Magazine. A monthly magazine devoted to Bay Area culture.\n\n\n=== Consulates ===\nSan Francisco is home to many people of different nationalities and language backgrounds. Therefore, many countries have established full service consulates (Consulates-General) in San Francisco to provide consular services for their nationals living in (northern) California and in the adjacent states in the northwestern part of the U.S. (or the entire west coast) as well as visa services for others seeking to visit their respective countries (if required). The Honorary Consulates are there for commercial and business purposes and offer limited or no consular services except in emergency situations. Most of the consulates are in downtown San Francisco and in the adjacent Pacific Heights & SoMa areas. They can also be located in other parts of town too:\n\n  Australia, 575 Market St Ste 1800, \u260f +1-415-644-3620, fax: +1-415-536-1982. \n  Belgium (Honorary), 1663 Mission St Ste 400, \u260f +1-415-861-9910, fax: +1-415-861-9801, consubelsf@gmail.com. \n  Brazil, 300 Montgomery St Ste 300, \u260f +1-415-981-8170, fax: +1-415-986-4625, brazilsf@brazilsf.org. \n  Canada, 580 California St, 14F, \u260f +1-415-834-3180, fax: +1-415-834-3189, sfran@international.gc.ca. \n  Chile, 870 Market St Ste 1058, \u260f +1-415-982-7662, +1-415-982-7665, fax: +1-415-982-2384, cgchile.sf@minrel.gov.cl.

Stanyan near Haight at the end of the park has several good shops.\nGolden Gate Transit also serves the North Bay from San Francisco, and has bike racks on most buses.\n\n\n=== Bay Area ===\nSan Jose \u2014 The heart of Silicon Valley and the biggest city in Bay Area.  Take Caltrain there.\nOakland \u2014 A diverse and vibrant city, Oakland was once considered San Francisco's \"sister city,\" and has been regaining that title due to a general renaissance of the city. Although not a major tourist destination, it's worth a visit for its many distinct and charming neighborhoods.  Take BART, or the ferry for great views.\nBerkeley \u2014  Home to the University of California, Berkeley is one of the nation's most progressive communities.  Also a hub of liberal political activism for the past several decades. It is also home to quite a few superb restaurants.  Accessible by BART's Red Line (towards Richmond).\nSausalito \u2014 Enjoy a ferry ride across the bay to beautiful Sausalito where you can walk along the water and admire the San Francisco skyline.  Stroll to the waterfront restaurants, shops, and galleries.\nHealdsburg \u2014 A charming Wine Country town located among some of California's greatest wine appellations: Alexander Valley, Dry Creek Valley, Russian River Valley and Chalk Hill. Relaxed yet sophisticated atmosphere, with excellent restaurants, shopping and wine tasting. About 70 miles north of the Golden Gate Bridge.\nNapa Valley \u2014  The main wine growing region in the United States, a trip to the many wineries makes for a fun day, while those wanting a longer adventure can relax in any one of the many spas, bed and breakfasts, or other lodging options.  Take the ferry to Vallejo, then VINE bus #11 to the City of Napa.\nMuir Woods \u2014 A 560-acre forest of old-growth redwood trees located in Mill Valley just north of the Golden Gate Bridge, Muir Woods is a pleasant respite from the city, and accessible by Golden Gate Transit on summer weekends.\nPoint Reyes National Seashore \u2014 Located just north of San Francisco along the Pacific Coast Highway (State Highway 1), Point Reyes is a beautiful seashore that is particularly nice to visit when gray whales are migrating along the coast, usually best in mid-January and then from March through May.\nPeninsula  \u2014 Just south of San Francisco, the peninsula has excellent nature preserves.\nPalo Alto \u2014 On the Peninsula south of the city, Palo Alto is home to Stanford University, has some of the richest neighborhoods in all of California and makes for a beautiful drive with views of the coastline and magnificent mansions.  Accessible by Caltrain.\nBurlingame \u2014 Another well off neighborhood on the Peninsula, Burlingame has a lovely downtown area with plenty of shops, dining and streets lined with cypress trees.  Accessible by Caltrain.\nMonterey \u2014 An otherwise quiet beach town home to one of the country's best aquariums.  Accessible by Amtrak, Greyhound, or the Monterey Airbus from SFO.\nSanta Cruz \u2014  Located on the coast north of Monterey Bay, this funky town is home to surfers, the beautiful and tech-savvy University of California, Santa Cruz, and a popular boardwalk.  The Santa Cruz Mountains north of town are a great place for outdoor recreation such as hiking, and home to misty forests of famous, enormous redwood trees.  Take Caltrain to San Jose, then SC Metro #17 bus.\nVallejo \u2014 Home to a wildlife theme park, Six Flags Discovery Kingdom.  Accessible by ferry.\n\n\n=== California ===\nYosemite National Park \u2014 Tours from San Francisco make for a wonderful day trip, although you will spend around 10 hours travelling for less than 4 in the park.  Make sure to visit the amazing Giant Sequoias.\nLake Tahoe \u2014 Buses and one Amtrak train per day link the Bay Area to nearby Truckee, and as with Yosemite, travel even by car to and from would consume much of the day.  However, the spectacular alpine setting and winter ski and snowboard options surrounding the Lake make Tahoe an unforgettable destination.\nSacramento is a nice city to visit, and is only a 1 1/2 hour drive without traffic, which is unlikely.  Other travel options include Megabus, Flixbus, Amtrak, and Greyhound.\nYou can also head down Highway 1 or 101 down the Coast and more interesting sites leading to Los Angeles will be seen.\n\n\n=== Beyond ===\nYou can also head up 101 to the Pacific Northwest, head east into Nevada, and get on a flight virtually anywhere at SFO Airport."
